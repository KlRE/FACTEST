# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 2.0, 0.0, 2.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.0, 10.0, 8.0, 10.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (1.3, 4.9, 3.6, 7.3)
			Obstacle 2: (3.1, 4.9, 9.1, 9.8)

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.0, 1.8), (4.0, 8.2), (4.0, 9.9)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
    obstacles = [
        (3.0, 3.5, 0.0, 5.0),   # Obstacle 1
        (3.0, 7.0, 5.5, 6.0),   # Obstacle 2
        (3.0, 7.0, -1.0, 0.0),   # Obstacle 3
    ]
### Example Response
    There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
    new_path = [
        (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
        (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
        (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
        (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
    ]

[08/13/2024 12:43:09 PM] Here's a possible path that meets the requirements:

**Path Explanation:**

1. **Start:** Begin at a point within the start set, for example, (1.0, 1.0).

2. **First Breakpoint:** Move diagonally to reach the breakpoint (4.0, 1.8). This avoids Obstacle 1.

3. **Second Breakpoint:** Move upwards to reach the second breakpoint (4.0, 8.2).

4. **Goal:** Move diagonally to reach a point within the goal set, for example, (9.0, 9.0). This avoids Obstacle 2.

**Path Array:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start
    (4.0, 1.8),  # Breakpoint 1
    (4.0, 8.2),  # Breakpoint 2
    (9.0, 9.0)   # Goal
]
```

**Verification:**

* The path starts within the start set and ends within the goal set.
* The path passes through the chosen breakpoints.
* The path does not intersect any obstacles; it navigates around them.

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.0, 1.8), (4.0, 8.2), (4.0, 9.9)]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.0, 1.0), (4.0, 1.8), (4.0, 8.2), (9.0, 9.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
    	Segment 2 between points (4.0, 1.8) and (4.0, 8.2) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 1: (1.3, 4.9, 3.6, 7.3)
	Longest valid subpath from start: [(1.0, 1.0), (4.0, 1.8)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[08/13/2024 12:43:12 PM] The provided path intersects with Obstacle 1. We need to adjust the path to avoid this collision.

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Identify the problematic segment:** The segment between (4.0, 1.8) and (4.0, 8.2) intersects with Obstacle 1.
2. **Find a detour:** We can detour around Obstacle 1 by moving horizontally to the right, avoiding the obstacle, and then moving vertically back towards the breakpoint (4.0, 8.2).
3. **Ensure breakpoints are included:** The path must pass through one of the breakpoints of each set. We will keep the breakpoint (4.0, 1.8) and the breakpoint (4.0, 8.2) in the path. 

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), # start in the start set
    (4.0, 1.8), # breakpoint 1
    (6.0, 1.8), # move horizontally to the right, avoiding Obstacle 1
    (6.0, 8.2), # move vertically back towards the breakpoint
    (4.0, 8.2), # breakpoint 2
    (9.0, 9.0), # end in the goal set
]
```

This new path avoids Obstacle 1, passes through the necessary breakpoints, and connects the start and goal sets.
