# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 2.0, 0.0, 2.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.0, 10.0, 8.0, 10.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (0.1, 1.0, 5.5, 9.6)
			Obstacle 2: (7.7, 9.4, 3.5, 6.5)

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.0, 5.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
    obstacles = [
        (3.0, 3.5, 0.0, 5.0),   # Obstacle 1
        (3.0, 7.0, 5.5, 6.0),   # Obstacle 2
        (3.0, 7.0, -1.0, 0.0),   # Obstacle 3
    ]
### Example Response
    There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
    new_path = [
        (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
        (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
        (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
        (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
    ]

[08/13/2024 12:43:00 PM] Here's a possible path solution:

**Path Reasoning:**

The path will start in the start set, navigate around Obstacle 1, pass through Breakpoint 1, and then move towards the goal set while avoiding Obstacle 2.

**Path Array:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start set
    (1.0, 5.0),  # Move upwards to avoid Obstacle 1
    (4.0, 5.0),  # Pass through Breakpoint 1
    (4.0, 6.0),  # Move downwards slightly to avoid Obstacle 2
    (9.0, 6.0),  # Move rightwards towards the goal set
    (9.0, 9.0),  # Move upwards to the goal set
    (9.5, 9.5)   # End within the goal set
]
```

    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 2.0, 0.0, 2.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.0, 10.0, 8.0, 10.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (0.1, 1.0, 5.5, 9.6)
			Obstacle 2: (7.7, 9.4, 3.5, 6.5)

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.0, 5.0)]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.0, 1.0), (1.0, 5.0), (4.0, 5.0), (4.0, 6.0), (9.0, 6.0), (9.0, 9.0), (9.5, 9.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
    	Segment 4 between points (4.0, 6.0) and (9.0, 6.0) intersects with obstacle(s):

	Longest valid subpath from start: [(1.0, 1.0), (1.0, 5.0), (4.0, 5.0), (4.0, 6.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[08/13/2024 12:43:03 PM] The provided path intersects with Obstacle 2. To correct this, we need to adjust the path to go around the obstacle. 

**Thought Process:**

1. **Identify the problematic segment:** The segment between (4.0, 6.0) and (9.0, 6.0) intersects with Obstacle 2.
2. **Find a detour:**  We can move the path upwards slightly to go around Obstacle 2. 
3. **Maintain the breakpoint:** We need to ensure the path still passes through the breakpoint (4.0, 5.0).

**Revised Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start
    (1.0, 5.0),  # Move upwards
    (4.0, 5.0),  # Pass through the breakpoint
    (4.0, 6.5),  # Move slightly above Obstacle 2
    (9.0, 6.5),  # Move right to avoid Obstacle 2
    (9.0, 9.0),  # Move upwards towards the goal
    (9.5, 9.5)  # End in the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

* The path now moves upwards from (4.0, 6.0) to (4.0, 6.5), avoiding Obstacle 2.
* It then continues rightwards and upwards to reach the goal set.
* The path still passes through the breakpoint (4.0, 5.0).

[08/13/2024 12:43:06 PM] The provided path intersects with Obstacle 2, causing an invalid segment.  Let's analyze the situation and create a new path:

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Identify the Invalid Segment:** The segment between (4.0, 6.5) and (9.0, 6.5) crosses Obstacle 2. 
2. **Find a Valid Path:**  We can move around Obstacle 2 by going above it. The breakpoint (4.0, 5.0) is within a safe region above Obstacle 2. 
3. **Connect the Valid Segments:** We can utilize the valid subpath up to (4.0, 6.5) and connect it to the breakpoint (4.0, 5.0). From there, we can continue moving upwards and then rightwards to reach the goal set. 

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start set
    (1.0, 5.0),  # Move upwards
    (4.0, 5.0),  # Breakpoint
    (4.0, 7.0),  # Move upwards above Obstacle 2
    (9.0, 7.0),  # Move rightwards
    (9.0, 9.0),  # Move upwards
    (9.5, 9.5)   # End within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

* We keep the initial segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (4.0, 5.0) as it is valid.
* We then add a segment to move above Obstacle 2 to (4.0, 7.0) by increasing the y-coordinate. 
* From there, we move rightwards to (9.0, 7.0) and then upwards to (9.0, 9.0).
* Finally, we end the path at (9.5, 9.5) within the goal set.
