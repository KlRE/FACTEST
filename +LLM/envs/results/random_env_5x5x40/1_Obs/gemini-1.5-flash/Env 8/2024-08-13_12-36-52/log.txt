# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 2.0, 0.0, 2.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.0, 10.0, 8.0, 10.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (8.9, 9.8, 1.9, 5.6)

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.0, 5.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
    obstacles = [
        (3.0, 3.5, 0.0, 5.0),   # Obstacle 1
        (3.0, 7.0, 5.5, 6.0),   # Obstacle 2
        (3.0, 7.0, -1.0, 0.0),   # Obstacle 3
    ]
### Example Response
    There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
    new_path = [
        (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
        (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
        (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
        (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
    ]

[08/13/2024 12:36:55 PM] Here's a possible path that meets the requirements:

**Understanding the Constraints:**

* The start set is a square at the bottom left of the environment.
* The goal set is a square at the top right.
* The obstacle is a rectangle in the top right corner, blocking a direct path from start to goal.
* We must pass through the breakpoint (4.0, 5.0).

**Path Design:**

1. **Start:**  Begin at (1.0, 1.0) within the start set.
2. **First Leg:**  Move upwards to the breakpoint (4.0, 5.0).
3. **Second Leg:**  Move rightwards towards the goal set, staying clear of the obstacle by maintaining a y-coordinate greater than 5.6. For example, move to (8.0, 5.7).
4. **Third Leg:**  Move upwards to a point within the goal set, like (8.5, 9.0).
5. **End:**  Finally, move to (9.0, 9.0) within the goal set.

**Path Array:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start
    (4.0, 5.0),  # Breakpoint
    (8.0, 5.7),  # Avoid obstacle
    (8.5, 9.0),  # Approach goal
    (9.0, 9.0)   # End
]
```

**Explanation:**

* The path starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
* It passes through the breakpoint (4.0, 5.0).
* It avoids crossing the obstacle by maintaining a safe distance.
* The segments are connected linearly.
