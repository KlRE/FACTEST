# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 2.0, 0.0, 2.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.0, 10.0, 8.0, 10.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (2.6, 7.7, 9.9, 10.0)
			Obstacle 2: (5.3, 6.1, 0.5, 7.7)
			Obstacle 3: (3.9, 5.2, 8.2, 9.5)

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.0, 4.1), (4.0, 9.7)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
    obstacles = [
        (3.0, 3.5, 0.0, 5.0),   # Obstacle 1
        (3.0, 7.0, 5.5, 6.0),   # Obstacle 2
        (3.0, 7.0, -1.0, 0.0),   # Obstacle 3
    ]
### Example Response
    There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
    new_path = [
        (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
        (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
        (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
        (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
    ]

[08/13/2024 12:58:22 PM] Here's a possible path solution, keeping in mind the requirements and the provided data:

**Path Planning Explanation:**

1. **Start:** Begin the path at a point within the start set, for example, (1.0, 1.0).

2. **First Breakpoint:** Move upwards towards the first breakpoint set, aiming for (4.0, 4.1). It's crucial to avoid Obstacle 3 by keeping a distance. For example, you could move to (4.0, 4.0). 

3. **Second Breakpoint:**  From the first breakpoint, move towards the second breakpoint set (4.0, 9.7),  keeping a distance from Obstacle 1. You could choose (4.0, 8.0) to avoid the obstacle. 

4. **Avoidance:**  Now, we need to navigate around Obstacle 2.  To do this, we can move right, going around the obstacle, aiming for a point like (7.0, 8.0).

5. **Goal:** Finally, from this point, move towards the goal set, ensuring you don't touch any obstacles. Choose a point within the goal set like (9.0, 9.0).

**Path Array:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start
    (4.0, 4.0),     # First breakpoint
    (4.0, 8.0),     # Second breakpoint
    (7.0, 8.0),     # Avoid Obstacle 2
    (9.0, 9.0)      # Goal
]
```

**Verification:**

* The path starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
* It passes through the chosen breakpoints (4.0, 4.0) and (4.0, 8.0).
* It maintains a safe distance from all obstacles and does not intersect any of them.
