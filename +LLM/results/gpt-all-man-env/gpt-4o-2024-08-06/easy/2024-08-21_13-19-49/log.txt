# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data

		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 1.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.

    obstacles = [
        (3.0, 3.5, 0.0, 5.0),   # Obstacle 1
        (3.0, 7.0, 5.5, 6.0),   # Obstacle 2
        (3.0, 7.0, -1.0, 0.0),   # Obstacle 3
    ]
### Example Response
    There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
    new_path = [
        (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
        (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
        (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
        (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
    ]

[08/21/2024 01:19:55 PM] To develop a feasible path that aligns with the provided criteria, let's first analyze the conditions:

1. **Start Area**: A point must be chosen within the rectangle (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0).
2. **Goal Area**: The path must end within the rectangle (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0).
3. **Obstacles**: The path must avoid the areas defined by the obstacles:
   - Obstacle 1: (2.0, 4.0, 0.0, 1.0)
   - Obstacle 2: (-2.0, 3.0, 2.0, 4.0)
4. **Breakpoints**: The path must pass through one breakpoint from the given set, [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 1.5), (2.0, 5.5)].

### Path Planning:
Let's start by choosing a point within the start rectangle and make our way to the goal rectangle while avoiding the obstacles.

- Begin in the start set ideally as the midpoint to give some flexibility: (0.5, 0.5).
- Choose a breakpoint that efficiently avoids both obstacles; here (2.0, 1.5) is a safe choice. This point moves above the first obstacle, ensuring clearance.
- Since Obstacle 2 stretches vertically from y = 2.0 to y = 4.0, we need to move around it. Therefore, a logical move would be:
  - After reaching the breakpoint (2.0, 1.5), continue horizontally until y = 1.5 clears the first obstacle.
  - Go directly upward to another waypoint clear above Obstacle 2.
- Finally, make a straightforward move to the goal position.

### Proposed Path:
```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start point within the start set
    (2.0, 1.5),   # Move to selected breakpoint which is clear of the obstacles
    (2.0, 4.5),   # Move vertically to go clear above Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)    # Move to the goal area while maintaining clearance from obstacles
]
```

This path respects all requirements and avoids collision with the obstacles, while starting and ending in the given sets and passing through one of the provided breakpoints.

[08/21/2024 01:20:06 PM] To correct and improve the path based on the feedback:

### Analysis of Current Path:
- **Segment 1: [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, 1.5)]**: This segment is valid as it starts within the start set and does not intersect with any obstacles.
- **Segment 2: [(2.0, 1.5), (2.0, 4.5)]**: This segment is problematic because it passes through Obstacle 2 which spans (-2.0, 3.0, 2.0, 4.0). Specifically, the y-coordinates of this segment (1.5 to 4.5) overlap with the y-range (2.0 to 4.0) of Obstacle 2, causing an intersection.
- **Segment 3: [(2.0, 4.5), (4.5, 4.5)]**: Since it's after an invalid segment, this segment cannot be reached as planned.

### Adjustments Needed:
1. **Continuing from the Valid Subpath**: The path is valid up to the point (2.0, 1.5). We will start from this point for further adjustments.
2. **Avoiding Obstacle 2**: We need to avoid intersecting Obstacles while ensuring the path utilizes one of the breakpoints. We can consider moving around the obstacle by moving diagonally upwards and to the right or consider another breakpoint.

### Proposed Path:
- Start within the start set at (0.5, 0.5).
- Use the valid part of the path up to (2.0, 1.5), passing through the breakpoint (2.0, 1.5).
- From (2.0, 1.5), the path should be adjusted to bypass Obstacle 2. We can move to the right before moving upwards:
  - Adjust the next point to (3.0, 1.5) to move past the boundary of Obstacle 2 along the x-axis.
  - Then move upwards to (3.0, 4.0), just beyond the top edge of Obstacle 2.
  - Finally, proceed to the goal set at (4.5, 4.5).

#### New Path
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),        # Start within the start set
    (2.0, 1.5),        # Valid breakpoint
    (3.0, 1.5),        # Avoid obstacle 2 by moving right
    (3.0, 4.0),        # Move above obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)         # Finish within the goal set
]
```

### Justification:
- This path avoids Obstacle 2 by first moving horizontally to bypass the obstruction, then vertically to align towards the goal, meeting the requirements of keeping a safe distance from obstacles.
- The new path still uses a breakpoint from the set, ensuring compliance with the path requirements.
- Each segment is linear and directly constructed from the provided sets.

[08/21/2024 01:20:17 PM] **Chain of Thought:**

1. **Understanding the Starting Path**: The initial path starts correctly at `(0.5, 0.5)` within the start set and includes a segment that moves through a breakpoint `(2.0, 1.5)`. It then moves to `(3.0, 1.5)` before the problematic section emerges.

2. **Analyzing the Problematic Segment**: The segment from `(3.0, 1.5)` to `(3.0, 4.0)` crosses into Obstacle 2, specifically in the vertical portion from `y = 2.0` to `y = 4.0`. This intersection with Obstacle 2 is what's causing the invalidation of this path segment.

3. **Identifying Breakpoints and Obstacles**: Since we need to pass through at least one breakpoint from the given set and we have several obstacles to navigate around, we must be creative in routing. 
   - We passed through a valid breakpoint `(2.0, 1.5)`.
   - Obstacle 1 (2.0 to 4.0, 0.0 to 1.0) lies to the north of our path. 
   - Obstacle 2 (from x = -2.0 to 3.0, y = 2.0 to 4.0) is vertically aligned over our path.

4. **Revising the Path to Avoid Obstacles**: Given that `(3.0, 1.5)` overlaps with Obstacle 2 when considering the movement northwards to `(3.0, 4.0)`, a detour around the obstacle is necessary. The south and west of the grid appear to provide a potential workaround.

5. **Planning the Detour**:
   - After reaching the first breakpoint `(2.0, 1.5)`, move to a new waypoint that not only avoids the obstacle but also aligns the path towards the goal set. 
   - Consider moving southwest initially (to the lower x-coordinates) to navigate around the constraints of the obstacle.

**Revised Path:**

Taking into account all of the factors discussed, a viable new path can be structured as follows:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),     # Start within the start set
    (2.0, 1.5),     # Pass through breakpoint, avoiding Obstacle 1
    (2.5, 1.5),     # Slightly move to the east to create room, avoiding collision
    (2.5, 3.5),     # Move up now that you are clear from Obstacle 1
    (4.5, 4.5)      # Now advance towards the goal set once clear of obstacles
]
```

This proposed path:
- Begins in the start set.
- Navigates through the valid breakpoint `(2.0, 1.5)`.
- Moves around Obstacle 1 and the risky portions of Obstacle 2.
- Ends within the goal set without intersecting any obstacles.

[08/21/2024 01:20:28 PM] ### Chain of Thought

1. **Understanding the existing path:**
   - The current path starts at (0.5, 0.5) in the start set and ends at (4.5, 4.5) in the goal set.
   - The path passes through a breakpoint at (2.0, 1.5), but a segment from (2.5, 1.5) to (2.5, 3.5) intersects with Obstacle 2.

2. **Spatial Relationship with Obstacles:**
   - Obstacle 1 lies between x = 2.0 and x = 4.0, and between y = 0.0 and y = 1.0.
   - Obstacle 2 lies between x = -2.0 and x = 3.0, and between y = 2.0 and y = 4.0.
   - Analyzing the feedback, it becomes evident that passing through (2.5, 1.5) onwards in a direct vertical line leads to intersection with Obstacle 2.

3. **Identification of Valid Subpath:**
   - The valid subpath given is [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5)], which means up to (2.5, 1.5) is safe.

4. **New Path Adjustments:**
   - To continue and correct the path, one approach is to navigate around Obstacle 2 after reaching (2.5, 1.5).
   - From (2.5, 1.5), a potential adjustment could involve moving right and then upwards to safely bypass the obstacle.

### Obstacle Avoidance and New Path Formation

1. **Start from Valid Subpath:**
   - Begin the path as given: (0.5, 0.5) -> (2.0, 1.5) -> (2.5, 1.5).

2. **Bypass Obstacle 2:**
   - From (2.5, 1.5), move further right to (3.5, 1.5) to steer clear of the overlapping region with Obstacle 2.

3. **Navigate Further Safely:**
   - Upon being clear of Obstacle 2’s y-boundary (2.0 to 4.0), progress upwards. Move from (3.5, 1.5) to (3.5, 4.0).

4. **End in the Goal Set:**
   - Once y = 4.0 is achieved, move right towards the goal: from (3.5, 4.0) to (4.5, 4.5).

### Final New Path

With these considerations, the new path to avoid crossing obstacles yet reaching the goal is:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (2.0, 1.5),    # Pass through a valid breakpoint
    (2.5, 1.5),    # Move to accumulate the pre-existing valid subpath
    (3.5, 1.5),    # Move right to steer clear of Obstacle 2
    (3.5, 4.0),    # Move upwards staying clear of vertical extent of Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Finally, reach the goal set
]
```

This newly calculated path safely avoids obstacles, uses a viable breakpoint, and meets the required path criteria.
