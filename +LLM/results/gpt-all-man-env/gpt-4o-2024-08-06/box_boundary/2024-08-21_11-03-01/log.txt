# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 2: (10.0, 10.1, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 3: (0.0, 10.0, -0.1, 0.0)
			Obstacle 4: (0.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.1)

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 5.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
    obstacles = [
        (3.0, 3.5, 0.0, 5.0),   # Obstacle 1
        (3.0, 7.0, 5.5, 6.0),   # Obstacle 2
        (3.0, 7.0, -1.0, 0.0),   # Obstacle 3
    ]
### Example Response
    There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
    new_path = [
        (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
        (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
        (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
        (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
    ]

[08/21/2024 11:03:09 AM] To create a path that meets all the specified requirements, we can plan a route from the start set to the goal set while avoiding the obstacles and passing through the specified breakpoint. Here's a detailed description of a possible path:

### Start and Goal Positions
- Start Position: A point within the rectangle (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0). Let's choose (1.75, 1.75) as the start point, which is centrally located within this area.
- Goal Position: A point within the rectangle (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5). Let's choose (9.0, 9.0) as the end point, which is centrally located within this area.

### Path through Breakpoints
- Breakpoint Set 1: We must pass through the point (5.12, 5.0).

### Obstacle Avoidance
The obstacles in this scenario form boundaries along the edges of the defined space. To avoid them:
- Avoid Obstacle 1, which is a vertical boundary at the left edge.
- Avoid Obstacle 2, which is a vertical boundary at the right edge.
- Avoid Obstacle 3, which is a horizontal boundary at the bottom edge.
- Avoid Obstacle 4, which is a horizontal boundary at the top edge.

### Constructed Path
Here’s a path that satisfies all criteria:

1. **Start in Start Set**: (1.75, 1.75)
2. **First Waypoint to Guide Path Upwards**: Move upwards and to the right, heading towards the breakpoint, which avoids lower obstacles. Set a waypoint: (3.0, 4.0).
3. **Pass through Breakpoint Set 1**: (5.12, 5.0), moving diagonally to ensure path crosses a breakpoint.
4. **Navigate towards the Goal Set**: Move diagonally upwards towards the goal area, avoiding the top boundary. Next waypoint: (7.0, 7.5).
5. **End in Goal Set**: Finally, reach the goal area: (9.0, 9.0).

### Final Path Array
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Starting point
    (3.0, 4.0),    # Guide point to start moving upwards
    (5.12, 5.0),   # Breakpoint, required path through
    (7.0, 7.5),    # Guide point towards the upper goal side
    (9.0, 9.0)     # Ending point in goal set
]
```

This path ensures non-crossing with the given obstacles, starts within the start set, ends within the goal set, and passes through the defined breakpoint.
