# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 2: (10.0, 10.1, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 3: (0.0, 10.0, -0.1, 0.0)
			Obstacle 4: (0.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.1)

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 5.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
    obstacles = [
        (3.0, 3.5, 0.0, 5.0),   # Obstacle 1
        (3.0, 7.0, 5.5, 6.0),   # Obstacle 2
        (3.0, 7.0, -1.0, 0.0),   # Obstacle 3
    ]
### Example Response
    There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
    new_path = [
        (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
        (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
        (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
        (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
    ]

[08/21/2024 11:03:00 AM] To solve the given motion planning task, we'll design a path that starts in the start set, passes through the breakpoint, and ends in the goal set while avoiding the obstacles. We'll ensure the path stays clear of the obstacles and connects waypoints linearly.

1. **Start Point**: Choose a point within the start set.
2. **Pass through the Breakpoint**: There is only one breakpoint given, so the path must pass through it.
3. **End Point**: Choose a point within the goal set.
4. **Path Sequence**: Ensure the path avoids all obstacles.

Given:
- **Start Set**: (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0)
- **Goal Set**: (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5)
- **Obstacles**:
  - Obstacle 1: (-0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 10.0)
  - Obstacle 2: (10.0, 10.1, 0.0, 10.0)
  - Obstacle 3: (0.0, 10.0, -0.1, 0.0)
  - Obstacle 4: (0.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.1)
- **Breakpoint Set 1**: [(5.12, 5.0)]

### New Path Plan:

1. **Start Point**: 
   - Let’s select an arbitrary point within the Start Set: (1.75, 1.75).

2. **Move towards and pass through the Breakpoint**:
   - Directly go to the breakpoint: (5.12, 5.0).

3. **End Point**:
   - Choose an arbitrary point within the Goal Set: (9.0, 9.0).

### Waypoint Path:

The new path in the format of waypoints will be:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Starting point within the start set
    (5.12, 5.0),   # Breakpoint
    (9.0, 9.0)     # End point within the goal set
]
```

### Obstacle Avoidance:
- The path avoids all obstacles by being strategically placed in areas not occupied by obstacles. Each segment between waypoints is checked to ensure it does not intersect the obstacles:
  - The first segment from (1.75, 1.75) to (5.12, 5.0) is clear.
  - The second segment from (5.12, 5.0) to (9.0, 9.0) avoids all obstacles as it lies well within the bounds provided.

This path adheres to the task requirements by starting within the start set, passing through a breakpoint, and ending within the goal set without intersecting any obstacles.
