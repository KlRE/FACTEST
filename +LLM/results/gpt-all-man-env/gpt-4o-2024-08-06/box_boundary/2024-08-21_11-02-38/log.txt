# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 2: (10.0, 10.1, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 3: (0.0, 10.0, -0.1, 0.0)
			Obstacle 4: (0.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.1)

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 5.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
    obstacles = [
        (3.0, 3.5, 0.0, 5.0),   # Obstacle 1
        (3.0, 7.0, 5.5, 6.0),   # Obstacle 2
        (3.0, 7.0, -1.0, 0.0),   # Obstacle 3
    ]
### Example Response
    There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
    new_path = [
        (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
        (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
        (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
        (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
    ]

[08/21/2024 11:02:49 AM] To solve the motion planning task based on the provided data and requirements, let's outline a potential path:

### Analysis
- **Start Position Set**: (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0)  
  - We will select a starting point within this rectangular area, e.g., (1.75, 1.75).
- **Goal Position Set**: (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5)  
  - We will select an ending point within this rectangular area, e.g., (9.0, 9.0).
- **Obstacles**:
  - Obstacle 1: (-0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 10.0) - Vertical line on the far left; it's not relevant to avoid since the start is well away from it.
  - Obstacle 2: (10.0, 10.1, 0.0, 10.0) - Vertical line on the far right; avoid by staying left.
  - Obstacle 3: (0.0, 10.0, -0.1, 0.0) - Horizontal line at the bottom; start is above this.
  - Obstacle 4: (0.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.1) - Horizontal line at the top; end is below this.
- **Breakpoints**:
  - Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 5.0)] must be used in the path.

### Path Plan
To construct a path meeting all requirements and avoiding the obstacles, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Start** in the Start Position Set.
2. **Move** towards the Breakpoint Set 1 that needs to be included.
3. **Continue** towards the Goal avoiding the obstacles and keeping a safe distance.

### Path Waypoints
Following the steps above, here is a feasible path:

- Start Point: (1.75, 1.75) [randomly chosen within the start set]
- Move towards the Breakpoint: (5.12, 5.0)
- Reach the Goal Point: (9.0, 9.0) [randomly chosen within the goal set]

### New Path Structure
Based on the strategic planning:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start within the start set
    (5.12, 5.0),   # Pass through the breakpoint
    (9.0, 9.0)     # End within the goal set
]
```

### Verification
- **Start and End** points are within their respective required sets.
- The path aligns linearly from one waypoint to another without crossing any obstacles.
- The path passes through the specified breakpoint as required.
- The endpoints and segment placements ensure that the path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles.

This new path ensures all constraints and requirements have been satisfied while avoiding the obstacles properly.
