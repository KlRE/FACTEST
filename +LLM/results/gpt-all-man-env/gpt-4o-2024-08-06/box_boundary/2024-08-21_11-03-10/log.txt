# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 2: (10.0, 10.1, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 3: (0.0, 10.0, -0.1, 0.0)
			Obstacle 4: (0.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.1)

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 5.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
    obstacles = [
        (3.0, 3.5, 0.0, 5.0),   # Obstacle 1
        (3.0, 7.0, 5.5, 6.0),   # Obstacle 2
        (3.0, 7.0, -1.0, 0.0),   # Obstacle 3
    ]
### Example Response
    There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
    new_path = [
        (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
        (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
        (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
        (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
    ]

[08/21/2024 11:03:17 AM] To create a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, passes through the specified breakpoints, and avoids the obstacles, we need to carefully choose our waypoints based on the given constraints. Here is a proposed path:

1. **Start Point**: Choose a point within the start set. Let's start at the middle of the start rectangle.
   
   - Start Point: \((1.75, 1.75)\)

2. **Intermediate Waypoint**: From the start, move directly towards and through the first breakpoint to ensure we hit it.

   - Breakpoint: \((5.12, 5.0)\)
   
3. **End Point**: Finally, move from the breakpoint to a point within the goal set, ensuring we avoid crossing any obstacles. Select a direct path to the middle of the goal rectangle from the breakpoint.

   - End Point: \((9.0, 9.0)\)

Given these considerations, the constructed path will look like this:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Starting within the start set
    (5.12, 5.0),    # Passing through the first breakpoint
    (9.0, 9.0)     # Ending within the goal set
]
```

### Path Verification:
- The path starts at a valid point within the start set \((1.5 \leq x \leq 2.0, 1.5 \leq y \leq 2.0)\).
- The path passes through the required breakpoint at \((5.12, 5.0)\).
- The final waypoint is within the goal set \((8.5 \leq x \leq 9.5, 8.5 \leq y \leq 9.5)\).
- This path avoids the obstacles, as it stays within the safe region defined by the problem and does not intersect any obstacle sets.
