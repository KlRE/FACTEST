# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 2: (10.0, 10.1, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 3: (0.0, 10.0, -0.1, 0.0)
			Obstacle 4: (0.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.1)

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 5.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
    obstacles = [
        (3.0, 3.5, 0.0, 5.0),   # Obstacle 1
        (3.0, 7.0, 5.5, 6.0),   # Obstacle 2
        (3.0, 7.0, -1.0, 0.0),   # Obstacle 3
    ]
### Example Response
    There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
    new_path = [
        (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
        (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
        (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
        (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
    ]

[08/21/2024 11:02:29 AM] To create a suitable path that starts within the start set, ends within the goal set, and avoids all obstacles while passing through the specified breakpoint, we can consider the following approach:

### Provided Data Recap
- **Start Set:** (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0)
- **Goal Set:** (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5)
- **Obstacles:**
  1. (-0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 10.0)
  2. (10.0, 10.1, 0.0, 10.0)
  3. (0.0, 10.0, -0.1, 0.0)
  4. (0.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.1)
- **Breakpoints:**
  - Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 5.0)]

### Path Planning
1. **Choose a Starting Point within the Start Set:**
   - Start at the center of the start set for simplicity: (1.75, 1.75).

2. **Choose a Path that Avoid Obstacles:**
   - Move towards the breakpoint while avoiding obstacles: head towards (5.12, 5.0).
   - Ensure the transition path from the start point to the breakpoint does not cross or touch any obstacles. Given the obstacle positioning, a direct path from the start point to the breakpoint is feasible.

3. **From the Breakpoint to the Goal Set:**
   - Proceed from the breakpoint (5.12, 5.0) directly to the goal set since there are no obstacles between the breakpoint and the goal range.
   - Choose a point within the goal region: (9.0, 9.0).

### Construct the Path
Taking these considerations into account, the path can be organized as follows:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Starting point within the start set
    (5.12, 5.0),   # Breakpoint from the Breakpoint Set 1
    (9.0, 9.0)     # Endpoint within the goal set
]
```

This path begins within the start set, passes through the specified breakpoint, and ends within the goal set, while avoiding all obstacles entirely.
