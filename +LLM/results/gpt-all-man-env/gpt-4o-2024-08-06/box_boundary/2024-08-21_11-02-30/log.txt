# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 2: (10.0, 10.1, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 3: (0.0, 10.0, -0.1, 0.0)
			Obstacle 4: (0.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.1)

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 5.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
    obstacles = [
        (3.0, 3.5, 0.0, 5.0),   # Obstacle 1
        (3.0, 7.0, 5.5, 6.0),   # Obstacle 2
        (3.0, 7.0, -1.0, 0.0),   # Obstacle 3
    ]
### Example Response
    There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
    new_path = [
        (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
        (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
        (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
        (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
    ]

[08/21/2024 11:02:37 AM] To create a path that satisfies the given conditions of starting from the Start Position, passing through a breakpoint, avoiding obstacles, and ending at the Goal Position, we can consider an approach that carefully navigates through the available space.

### Planned Path:

1. **Start Point:** We begin within the Start Position, choosing a point that is comfortably away from the edges to ensure space for path maneuvers.
   - Start within (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0). Let's choose (1.75, 1.75).

2. **Waypoint 1:** Navigate towards the breakpoint. We can choose a straight path that steers clear of obstacles 1, 2, and 3.
   - Move horizontally to the right while maintaining the vertical position initially, avoid the lower boundary obstacle.
   - Reach the x-coordinate of the chosen breakpoint while ensuring y is clear from obstacles below. Hence, a suitable point would be (5.12, 1.75).

3. **Breakpoint Passage:** Here, we pass through the given breakpoint.
   - Breakpoint is (5.12, 5.0), which is already vertically halfway through the vertical extent, providing a clear buffer from top and bottom.

4. **Waypoint 2:** Travel further up once reaching the breakpoint to avoid the upper-bound obstacle.
   - Ascend vertically to get closer to the Goal Height while moving slightly on x-axis: (7.0, 5.5).

5. **Waypoint 3:** Navigate directly towards the Goal Position within its rectangular area.
   - End within (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5). End the path at (9.0, 9.0).

### Complete Path Array:
``` 
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start Point
    (5.12, 1.75),  # Move horizontally avoiding lower obstacles
    (5.12, 5.0),   # Breakpoint pass-through
    (7.0, 5.5),    # Move upwards towards upper safe space 
    (9.0, 9.0)     # Goal Point
]
```

This path ensures that we start in the start set, pass through the breakpoint, and end in the goal set while maintaining a safe distance from all specified obstacles.
