# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 2: (10.0, 10.1, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 3: (0.0, 10.0, -0.1, 0.0)
			Obstacle 4: (0.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.1)

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 5.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
    obstacles = [
        (3.0, 3.5, 0.0, 5.0),   # Obstacle 1
        (3.0, 7.0, 5.5, 6.0),   # Obstacle 2
        (3.0, 7.0, -1.0, 0.0),   # Obstacle 3
    ]
### Example Response
    There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
    new_path = [
        (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
        (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
        (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
        (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
    ]

[08/21/2024 11:03:29 AM] To create a viable path based on the given constraints, we will navigate from the start position through one of the provided breakpoints to reach the goal position while avoiding obstacles. Here’s one way to form such a path:

### Path Planning

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Choose Starting Point:** Select a starting point from within the start set (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0). Let's choose (1.75, 1.75) for simplicity and central positioning.
2. **Navigate to Breakpoint:** Move toward the breakpoint at (5.12, 5.0). This directly avoids obstacles while moving towards the goal.
3. **Direct Path to Goal:** From the breakpoint (5.12, 5.0), continue to a point within the goal set (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5) while ensuring no intersection with obstacles. A simple choice is (9.0, 9.0).

### New Path Array
Based on this explanation, the planned path can be structured as follows:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),    # Starting at a midpoint within start set
    (5.12, 5.0),     # Navigate through the breakpoint
    (9.0, 9.0)       # Reach the center of the goal set
]
```

### Obstacle Avoidance Verification
- The chosen path avoids Obstacles 1 through 4 entirely since it travels within the corridor defined by y ranges: 1.5 to 10.0 (entire field), and avoids the x boundaries set by Obstacle 2 at 10 and -0.1 at 0 for Obstacle 1.
- This path efficiently moves from the start to the goal while respecting the conditions of passing through designated breakpoints and maintaining clear distance from all obstacles.
