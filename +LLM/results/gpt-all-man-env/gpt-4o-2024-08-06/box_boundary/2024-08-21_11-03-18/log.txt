# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 2: (10.0, 10.1, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 3: (0.0, 10.0, -0.1, 0.0)
			Obstacle 4: (0.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.1)

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 5.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
    obstacles = [
        (3.0, 3.5, 0.0, 5.0),   # Obstacle 1
        (3.0, 7.0, 5.5, 6.0),   # Obstacle 2
        (3.0, 7.0, -1.0, 0.0),   # Obstacle 3
    ]
### Example Response
    There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
    new_path = [
        (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
        (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
        (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
        (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
    ]

[08/21/2024 11:03:23 AM] To construct a path from the start set to the goal set while avoiding the obstacles, and ensuring that the path passes through the required breakpoint, we can follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Choose a Starting Point**: Select a point within the start set (rectangular area from 1.5 to 2.0 on both dimensions). Let's start at (1.75, 1.75), a central point within this range.

2. **Navigation Strategy**: Determine a path that avoids the obstacles. Since obstacles encompass the left and right vertical edges and the top and bottom horizontal edges of the workspace, choosing an intermediate point to avoid the obstacles is essential. Additionally, ensure your path passes through the specified breakpoint set (5.12, 5.0).

3. **Pass Through Breakpoint**: Plan a path towards the provided breakpoint (5.12, 5.0), ensuring a smooth trajectory that doesn’t intersect any obstacles. 

4. **Reach the Goal Set**: Choose any point within the goal area (from 8.5 to 9.5 on both dimensions) to end the path. Let's end at (9.0, 9.0), a central point within this range.

### Suggested Path

Given these considerations, we compile the path as follows:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Starting point within the start set
    (5.12, 5.0),   # Passing through the breakpoint
    (9.0, 9.0)     # Ending point within the goal set
]
```

### Verification

- **Safety from Obstacle Collision**: The path chosen avoids all obstacles defined by the extreme edges of the workspace, as the trajectory moves centrally through the defined area between a valid start and end point.
  
- **Adherence to Constraints**: It begins in the start set, passes through the specified breakpoint, and concludes in the goal set.

By maintaining central alignment in the spatial domain (X, Y), the trajectory honors constraints and navigates between obstacles effectively.
