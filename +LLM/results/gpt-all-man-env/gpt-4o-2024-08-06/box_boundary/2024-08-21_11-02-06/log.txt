# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 2: (10.0, 10.1, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 3: (0.0, 10.0, -0.1, 0.0)
			Obstacle 4: (0.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.1)

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 5.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
    obstacles = [
        (3.0, 3.5, 0.0, 5.0),   # Obstacle 1
        (3.0, 7.0, 5.5, 6.0),   # Obstacle 2
        (3.0, 7.0, -1.0, 0.0),   # Obstacle 3
    ]
### Example Response
    There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
    new_path = [
        (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
        (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
        (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
        (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
    ]

[08/21/2024 11:02:14 AM] To create a path that meets all the given conditions, we need to ensure that it begins within the start set, passes through the specified breakpoints, avoids all obstacles, and concludes within the goal set. Here's a direct path solution:

### Path Plan
1. **Start Point**: Since we need to start within the given rectangle of (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0), we can choose the point (1.75, 1.75), which is well within the bounds.
2. **Breaking through Breakpoint Set 1**: There is only one breakpoint in the set [(5.12, 5.0)], so we must pass through it.
3. **Goal Point**: End the path within the rectangle (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5). Let's choose the point (9.0, 9.0).
4. **Obstacle Avoidance**: Ensure the path does not cross or touch any obstacles:
   - The obstacles are the vertical boundaries at x = -0.1 to 0.0 and x = 10.0 to 10.1, and horizontal boundaries at y = -0.1 to 0.0 and y = 10.0 to 10.1, which are all clear for passing from the inside.
   - Move from (1.75, 1.75) to (5.12, 5.0) avoiding any obstacles directly.
   - Finally, move to (9.0, 9.0) avoiding any obstacles.

### New Path
Based on the conditions above, we propose the following waypoints for the new path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Starting point within the start set
    (5.12, 5.0),   # Breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1
    (9.0, 9.0)     # Ending point within the goal set
]
```

This path ensures we adhere to all requirements, including beginning and ending within the respective start and goal boundaries, passing through the required breakpoint, and not intersecting any obstacles.
