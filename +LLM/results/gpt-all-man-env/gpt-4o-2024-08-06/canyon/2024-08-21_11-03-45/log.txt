# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-2.0, 7.0, 1.0, 3.0)
			Obstacle 2: (-2.0, 7.0, -2.0, 0.0)

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, 0.5)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
    obstacles = [
        (3.0, 3.5, 0.0, 5.0),   # Obstacle 1
        (3.0, 7.0, 5.5, 6.0),   # Obstacle 2
        (3.0, 7.0, -1.0, 0.0),   # Obstacle 3
    ]
### Example Response
    There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
    new_path = [
        (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
        (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
        (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
        (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
    ]

[08/21/2024 11:03:53 AM] To construct a path that fulfills all the given requirements, we must ensure that the path begins within the start set, passes through the specified breakpoints, avoids crossing the obstacles, and ends within the goal set. Here is a possible path:

### Analysis:
1. **Start Set**: (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)  
   We can start at the center of the start set, for instance, at (0.5, 0.5).

2. **Goal Set**: (4.0, 5.0, 0.0, 1.0)  
   We can end at the center of the goal set, at (4.5, 0.5).

3. **Obstacles**:  
   - Obstacle 1 covers from (-2.0, 7.0) along y=1.0 to y=3.0; hence, our path needs to stay below y=1.0 to avoid this obstacle.
   - Obstacle 2 covers from (-2.0, 7.0) along y=-2.0 to y=0.0; hence, our path needs to stay above y=0.0 to avoid this obstacle.

4. **Breakpoints**:
   - Breakpoint at (2.0, 0.5) needs to be included in the path.

### Path Creation:
We can form a straightforward path because all obstacles span vertically and our areas of interest (start, breakpoints, goal) all lie horizontally aligned at y=0.5 (between the top of Obstacle 2 and bottom of Obstacle 1).

### New Path:
Given the setup, the path can look like this:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start within the start set
    (2.0, 0.5),  # Go through the breakpoint
    (4.5, 0.5)   # End within the goal set
]
```

### Verification:
- This path starts at (0.5, 0.5) within the start set.
- It passes through (2.0, 0.5), the breakpoint.
- It ends at (4.5, 0.5) within the goal set.
- Throughout the path, the y-coordinate remains at 0.5, which is exactly between the bottom of the higher obstacle and the top of the lower obstacle, thus satisfying the non-crossing requirement.
