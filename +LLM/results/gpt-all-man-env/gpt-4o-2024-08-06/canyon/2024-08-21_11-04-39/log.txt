# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-2.0, 7.0, 1.0, 3.0)
			Obstacle 2: (-2.0, 7.0, -2.0, 0.0)

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, 0.5)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
    obstacles = [
        (3.0, 3.5, 0.0, 5.0),   # Obstacle 1
        (3.0, 7.0, 5.5, 6.0),   # Obstacle 2
        (3.0, 7.0, -1.0, 0.0),   # Obstacle 3
    ]
### Example Response
    There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
    new_path = [
        (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
        (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
        (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
        (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
    ]

[08/21/2024 11:04:50 AM] In this motion planning task, we'll design a path that starts within the specified start set, passes through the given breakpoints, and ends in the goal set. Additionally, the path must avoid the defined obstacles, taking care to maintain a safe distance from them.

**Analysis:**

1. **Start Set:** The start set is defined by the rectangle (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0). We can choose any point within this rectangle to start.

2. **Goal Set:** The goal set is defined by the rectangle (4.0, 5.0, 0.0, 1.0). Similarly, we can choose any point within this rectangle to end.

3. **Obstacles:**
   - Obstacle 1: (-2.0, 7.0, 1.0, 3.0)
   - Obstacle 2: (-2.0, 7.0, -2.0, 0.0)
   These obstacles cover a broad horizontal band above and below the workspace, but they leave a vertical corridor between 0.0 and 1.0 in the y-axis.

4. **Breakpoints:** 
   - Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, 0.5)]

**Path Planning:**

- Given the position of the obstacles between y = 1.0 and y = 3.0 and below y = 0.0, the path has to navigate horizontally between these y-values.
- A strategy would be to start in the start set, move horizontally through the free vertical space (y = 0.5), pass through the breakpoint, and continue to the goal set.

**New Path:**

To plan a path that meets all criteria (avoids obstacles and passes through breakpoints), we propose the following waypoints:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start in the start set
    (2.0, 0.5),  # Move to and pass through the breakpoint
    (4.5, 0.5)   # End in the goal set
]
```

- **Start Point:** (0.5, 0.5) is within the start set.
- **Waypoint through Breakpoint:** (2.0, 0.5) ensures that the path passes through the one specified breakpoint.
- **Goal Point:** (4.5, 0.5) is within the goal set, safely concluding the path.

The path avoids intersections with any obstacles by maintaining a safe y-value of 0.5, which is between the two obstacles' vertical extents.
