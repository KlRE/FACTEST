# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-2.0, 7.0, 1.0, 3.0)
			Obstacle 2: (-2.0, 7.0, -2.0, 0.0)

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, 0.5)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
    obstacles = [
        (3.0, 3.5, 0.0, 5.0),   # Obstacle 1
        (3.0, 7.0, 5.5, 6.0),   # Obstacle 2
        (3.0, 7.0, -1.0, 0.0),   # Obstacle 3
    ]
### Example Response
    There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
    new_path = [
        (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
        (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
        (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
        (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
    ]

[08/21/2024 11:05:14 AM] Given the motion planning task, here is a path that respects the given constraints:

### Analysis
1. **Start and Goal Sets**:
   - The start point must be within the rectangle `(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)`.
   - The goal point must be within the rectangle `(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 0.0, 1.0)`.

2. **Obstacles**:
   - Two obstacles are present, forbidding any segment of the path from touching or crossing them.
   - Obstacle 1: `(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (-2.0, 7.0, 1.0, 3.0)`
   - Obstacle 2: `(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (-2.0, 7.0, -2.0, 0.0)`

3. **Breakpoints**:
   - The path must pass through the specified breakpoint `(2.0, 0.5)` from Breakpoint Set 1.

### Path Planning
To avoid the obstacles, the path should stay within the central area where `0.0 < y < 1.0` and make sure it passes through the required breakpoint.

### Proposed Path
The path can be defined by these waypoints:

```python
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (2.0, 0.5),    # Pass through the required breakpoint
    (4.5, 0.5)     # End within the goal set
]
```

### Explanation
- **(0.5, 0.5)**: The chosen start point is well within the start rectangle and lies below the lower boundary of the horizontal obstacle.
- **(2.0, 0.5)**: This waypoint is the specified breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1, ensuring compliance with the requirement to pass through a breakpoint.
- **(4.5, 0.5)**: The path ends within the goal rectangle, maintaining a consistent trajectory that threads the permissible space between the vertical boundaries of the obstacles.
  
This path avoids both obstacles by maintaining a y-coordinate of `0.5`, which keeps it out of the vertical spans of the obstacles and ensures it passes through the necessary breakpoint.
