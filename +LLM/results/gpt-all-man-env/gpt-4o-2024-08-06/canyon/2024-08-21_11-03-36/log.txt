# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-2.0, 7.0, 1.0, 3.0)
			Obstacle 2: (-2.0, 7.0, -2.0, 0.0)

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, 0.5)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
    obstacles = [
        (3.0, 3.5, 0.0, 5.0),   # Obstacle 1
        (3.0, 7.0, 5.5, 6.0),   # Obstacle 2
        (3.0, 7.0, -1.0, 0.0),   # Obstacle 3
    ]
### Example Response
    There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
    new_path = [
        (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
        (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
        (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
        (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
    ]

[08/21/2024 11:03:44 AM] To create a path that adheres to the provided constraints and avoids the specified obstacles, we must begin in the Start Position, pass through the required breakpoint, and conclude at the Goal Position while maintaining a safe distance from obstacles. Here is a suitable path:

### Path:
1. **Start Point:** Choose a starting point within the defined rectangular Start Position, such as `(0.5, 0.5)`.
2. **Breakpoint:** Navigate to the given Breakpoint Set 1 at `(2.0, 0.5)`.
3. **Intermediate Point:** Since the path must avoid obstacles and both given obstacles span the same y-range, the path needs to stay at y = 0.5 which is clear of obstacles. Move directly to an intermediate point `(2.5, 0.5)`.
4. **Goal Approach:** Continue to another intermediate point that positions the path aligning towards the goal, such as `(3.5, 0.5)`, and then `(4.0, 0.5)`.
5. **End Point:** Finally, end within the Goal Position at `(4.5, 0.5)`.

### New Path:
The resulting path is a set of waypoints:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start in the Start Position
    (2.0, 0.5),  # Pass through the Breakpoint
    (2.5, 0.5),  # Intermediate waypoint, avoiding obstacles
    (3.5, 0.5),  # Continue towards the goal while avoiding obstacles
    (4.0, 0.5),  # Position near the goal
    (4.5, 0.5)   # End in the Goal Position
]
```

### Verification:
- The path begins in the Start Position `(0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)`.
- The path passes through the Breakpoint at `(2.0, 0.5)`.
- The path avoids crossing any part of the obstacle spaces, given the obstacle extents and the chosen path coordinates.
- The path concludes in the Goal Position `(4.0, 5.0, 0.0, 1.0)`.
