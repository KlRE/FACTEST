# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-2.0, 7.0, 1.0, 3.0)
			Obstacle 2: (-2.0, 7.0, -2.0, 0.0)

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, 0.5)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
    obstacles = [
        (3.0, 3.5, 0.0, 5.0),   # Obstacle 1
        (3.0, 7.0, 5.5, 6.0),   # Obstacle 2
        (3.0, 7.0, -1.0, 0.0),   # Obstacle 3
    ]
### Example Response
    There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
    new_path = [
        (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
        (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
        (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
        (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
    ]

[08/21/2024 11:04:38 AM] To plan a path that meets all the specified requirements, including starting in the start set, avoiding obstacles, passing through the breakpoint, and ending in the goal set, the following path array can be considered:

### Path Planning
1. **Start Point**: Begin within the start set, which is defined as (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0). We can choose the point (0.5, 0.5) as a valid starting point.

2. **Breakpoint**: Include a breakpoint from the given Breakpoint Set 1, (2.0, 0.5).

3. **End Point**: End within the goal set, which is defined as (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 0.0, 1.0). We can choose the point (4.5, 0.5).

4. **Obstacle Avoidance**: Avoid the obstacles. The obstacles are stretched vertically and horizontally between y = 1.0 and y = -2.0 at various x positions from -2.0 to 7.0. Hence, we need to ensure that the path remains within y = 0.0 to y = 1.0.

### Proposed Path
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start within the start set
    (2.0, 0.5),   # Pass through the breakpoint
    (4.5, 0.5)    # End within the goal set while avoiding obstacles
]
```

### Explanation
- **(0.5, 0.5)**: Starting point within the start set.
- **(2.0, 0.5)**: The waypoint that is a breakpoint, ensuring we respect the requirement to pass through a breakpoint.
- **(4.5, 0.5)**: Ending point within the goal set.

This path stays within the permissible y-range of 0.0 to 1.0, avoiding the obstacles which are located above and below this range. Therefore, it satisfies the path requirements without crossing any obstacles.
