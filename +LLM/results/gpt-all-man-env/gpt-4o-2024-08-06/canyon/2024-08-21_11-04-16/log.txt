# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-2.0, 7.0, 1.0, 3.0)
			Obstacle 2: (-2.0, 7.0, -2.0, 0.0)

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, 0.5)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
    obstacles = [
        (3.0, 3.5, 0.0, 5.0),   # Obstacle 1
        (3.0, 7.0, 5.5, 6.0),   # Obstacle 2
        (3.0, 7.0, -1.0, 0.0),   # Obstacle 3
    ]
### Example Response
    There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
    new_path = [
        (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
        (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
        (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
        (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
    ]

[08/21/2024 11:04:25 AM] To successfully plan a path that starts from the designated start set, passes through the required breakpoints, avoids the obstacles, and ends in the goal set, let's create a path based on the given constraints.

### Provided Data Recap:
- **Start Position**: Rectangle from (0.0, 1.0) to (1.0, 1.0)
- **Goal Position**: Rectangle from (4.0, 0.0) to (5.0, 1.0)
- **Obstacles**:
  - Obstacle 1: (-2.0, 7.0, 1.0, 3.0)
  - Obstacle 2: (-2.0, 7.0, -2.0, 0.0)
- **Breakpoints**:
  - Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, 0.5)]

### Path Planning Steps:
1. **Choose a Start Point**: A point within the start rectangle, e.g., (0.5, 0.5).
2. **Navigate Through Breakpoint**: Ensure to pass through (2.0, 0.5) from Breakpoint Set 1.
3. **Avoid Obstacles**: 
   - Move horizontally to avoid the vertical space occupied by obstacles.
   - Utilize the y=0.5 position which lies between the bottom and top obstacles' y-boundaries.

4. **Choose an End Point**: A point within the goal rectangle, e.g., (4.5, 0.5).

### Constructed Path:
The path will be as follows:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start point within the start set
    (2.0, 0.5),   # Pass through Breakpoint Set 1
    (4.5, 0.5)    # End point within the goal set
]
```

### Explanation:
- Start at (0.5, 0.5) within the start set boundary.
- Move straight to the breakpoint at (2.0, 0.5), maintaining clearance from the obstacle edges.
- Proceed directly to the goal at (4.5, 0.5), keeping within the safe passageway that avoids the obstacle boundaries.

This path ensures no contact with the obstacles while meeting all the specified requirements, including using the breakpoint and beginning and ending within the designated sets.
