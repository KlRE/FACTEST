# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.0, 9.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (4.0, 5.0, -3.0, 4.0)

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.0, -4.0), (4.0, 5.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
    obstacles = [
        (3.0, 3.5, 0.0, 5.0),   # Obstacle 1
        (3.0, 7.0, 5.5, 6.0),   # Obstacle 2
        (3.0, 7.0, -1.0, 0.0),   # Obstacle 3
    ]
### Example Response
    There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
    new_path = [
        (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
        (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
        (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
        (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
    ]

[08/21/2024 04:26:53 PM] ## Analysis

Given the start and goal positions, obstacles, and breakpoints, we need to construct a path that avoids the obstacle while starting within the start set, ending in the goal set, and passing through the given breakpoints. The obstacle is positioned from (4.0, -3.0) to (5.0, 4.0), effectively forming a vertical block that needs to be circumvented.

## Potential Path

1. **Start Point**: Choose a point within the start set, say (0.5, 0.5).
   
2. **Bypass the Obstacle**: Since the obstacle spans from \( y = -3.0 \) to \( y = 4.0 \), consider going around its lower boundary by heading towards the specified breakpoint below the obstacle.

3. **Breakpoint**: Visit a breakpoint. We can choose point (4.0, -4.0) as it is below the obstacle and hence doesn't conflict with the obstacle boundary.

4. **Navigate Around the Obstacle**: 
     - Move horizontally from (0.5, 0.5) to (4.0, -4.0), keeping clear of the obstacle.
     - Ascend vertically to a point that clears end within the reachable boundary of the obstacle while staying to its right at (5.5, -4.0).

5. **Final Segment**: Move laterally to the goal set, ensuring to stay clear of the obstacle.

6. **End Point**: End the path at a point within the goal set, let's choose (8.5, 0.5).

## New Path

Here is one potential path that meets the requirements:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start point
    (4.0, -4.0), # Breakpoint, bypassing below the obstacle
    (5.5, -4.0), # Move rightwards staying clear past the obstacle
    (8.5, 0.5)   # End point in the goal set
]
```

This path starts within the prescribed start area, avoids the obstacle by staying below it, passes through a defined breakpoint, and finishes within the goal region, meeting all the path planning requirements without intersecting any obstacles.
