# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.0, 9.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (4.0, 5.0, -3.0, 4.0)

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.0, -4.0), (4.0, 5.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
    obstacles = [
        (3.0, 3.5, 0.0, 5.0),   # Obstacle 1
        (3.0, 7.0, 5.5, 6.0),   # Obstacle 2
        (3.0, 7.0, -1.0, 0.0),   # Obstacle 3
    ]
### Example Response
    There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
    new_path = [
        (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
        (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
        (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
        (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
    ]

[08/21/2024 04:27:16 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, here is a path that satisfies all conditions:

### Given Information
- **Start Position (Rectangular Set):** (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
- **Goal Position:** (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.0, 9.0, 0.0, 1.0)
- **Obstacles:** 
  - Obstacle 1: (4.0, 5.0, -3.0, 4.0)
- **Breakpoints:**
  - Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.0, -4.0), (4.0, 5.0)]

### Path Planning
1. **Starting Point:** Choose a point within the start set, e.g., (0.5, 0.5).
2. **Avoiding Obstacle:** Navigate around the top of Obstacle 1 and through the upper breakpoint since Obstacle 1 covers a vertical range from -3.0 to 4.0.
3. **End Point:** Choose a point within the goal set, e.g., (8.5, 0.5).

### Path Description
- Start at (0.5, 0.5), which is inside the start position rectangle.
- Move upwards to (0.5, 5.0) to avoid Obstacle 1.
- Move rightwards along the y = 5.0 line to the upper breakpoint at (4.0, 5.0).
- Continue rightwards to clear the obstacle completely to a safer point (6.0, 5.0).
- Move downwards to enter the goal position at (8.5, 0.5).

### Path as Array
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start within the start position 
    (0.5, 5.0),  # Move up to avoid the obstacle by staying above it
    (4.0, 5.0),  # Pass through the upper breakpoint
    (6.0, 5.0),  # Clear the obstacle
    (8.5, 0.5)   # End within the goal position
]
```

This path follows the guidelines by:
- Starting within the specified start set.
- Passing through the designated breakpoint while avoiding the obstacle.
- Ending within the specified goal set.
