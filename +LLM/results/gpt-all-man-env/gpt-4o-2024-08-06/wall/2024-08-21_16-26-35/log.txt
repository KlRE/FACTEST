# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.0, 9.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (4.0, 5.0, -3.0, 4.0)

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.0, -4.0), (4.0, 5.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
    obstacles = [
        (3.0, 3.5, 0.0, 5.0),   # Obstacle 1
        (3.0, 7.0, 5.5, 6.0),   # Obstacle 2
        (3.0, 7.0, -1.0, 0.0),   # Obstacle 3
    ]
### Example Response
    There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
    new_path = [
        (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
        (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
        (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
        (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
    ]

[08/21/2024 04:26:44 PM] To create a path from the start set to the goal set while avoiding obstacles and passing through the given breakpoints, we can consider the following pathway:

### Provided Data
- **Start Position (Rectangular Set):** (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
- **Goal Position (Rectangular Set):** (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.0, 9.0, 0.0, 1.0)
- **Obstacles (Rectangular Sets):**
  - Obstacle 1: (4.0, 5.0, -3.0, 4.0)
- **Breakpoints:**
  - Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.0, -4.0), (4.0, 5.0)]

### Pathway Description
1. Start from a point within the start position rectangle. We choose a point like (0.5, 0.5).
2. Head towards one of the breakpoints in Breakpoint Set 1. Select the point (4.0, -4.0), which is safely below the obstacle and does not intersect with it.
3. Move upward to maintain a safe distance outside the obstacle's y-range (which extends up to y=4.0). Transition to a point with a y-coordinate just slightly below the obstacle, maintaining clearance, e.g., (4.0, -4.1).
4. Proceed to a point within the goal position rectangle, completing the path, like (8.5, 0.5).

### New Path
Let's put this into a path format:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start point within the start set
    (4.0, -4.0),  # Pass through the chosen breakpoint
    (4.0, -4.1),  # Move upwards while maintaining a safe distance from the obstacle
    (8.5, 0.5)    # End point within the goal set
]
```

This path ensures:
- It begins and ends in their respective sets.
- It passes through one breakpoint from the provided breakpoints.
- It avoids intersecting the obstacle by maintaining a safe clearance.
