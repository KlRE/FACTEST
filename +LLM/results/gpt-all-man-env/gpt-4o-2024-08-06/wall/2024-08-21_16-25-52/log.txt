# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.0, 9.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (4.0, 5.0, -3.0, 4.0)

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.0, -4.0), (4.0, 5.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
    obstacles = [
        (3.0, 3.5, 0.0, 5.0),   # Obstacle 1
        (3.0, 7.0, 5.5, 6.0),   # Obstacle 2
        (3.0, 7.0, -1.0, 0.0),   # Obstacle 3
    ]
### Example Response
    There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
    new_path = [
        (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
        (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
        (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
        (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
    ]

[08/21/2024 04:26:00 PM] To design a path that meets the specified requirements, we need to start within the start set, end within the goal set, pass through a breakpoint from each set, and avoid the obstacle. Here is a valid path:

### New Path Plan
1. **Start Point:** Begin at a point within the start set. We can select a point like (0.5, 0.5) which is centrally located within the start rectangle.
2. **First Breakpoint:** We need to pass through one of the breakpoints. Select the point (4.0, -4.0) which is well below the obstacle.
3. **Polyline Pathing:**
   - Move horizontally from the start point (0.5, 0.5) to a point left of the obstacle, such as (2.0, 0.5).
   - Then move downward to reach the first breakpoint at (4.0, -4.0).
   - From the breakpoint (4.0, -4.0), move upwards and to the right to avoid the obstacle completely and progress towards the goal set, swinging above the obstacle; for example, move to (6.5, -3.5).
   - From this point, move horizontally to the right to avoid the obstacle entirely.
   - Adjust the path vertically if necessary to reach within the height constraints of the goal set and then proceed to the end point (8.5, 0.5).

### New Path Array

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start in the start set
    (4.0, -4.0),   # Move to the first breakpoint
    (6.5, -3.5),   # Navigate around the obstacle
    (8.5, 0.5)     # End in the goal set
]
```

### Explanation
- **Start Point:** (0.5, 0.5) is within the start set.
- **First Breakpoint:** (4.0, -4.0) is chosen to satisfy the requirement of passing through a breakpoint.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** The path is designed to move around the obstacle without crossing it. There's a sufficient clearance as the path moves under and then around the obstacle.
- **End Point:** (8.5, 0.5) is within the specified goal set, meeting the requirement to end within that region.

This plan ensures the path follows all the given specifications including starting and ending within the defined set, avoiding the obstacles, and incorporating the necessary breakpoints.
