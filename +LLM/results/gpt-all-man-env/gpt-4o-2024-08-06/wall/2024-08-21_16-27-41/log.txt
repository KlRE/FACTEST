# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.0, 9.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (4.0, 5.0, -3.0, 4.0)

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.0, -4.0), (4.0, 5.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
    obstacles = [
        (3.0, 3.5, 0.0, 5.0),   # Obstacle 1
        (3.0, 7.0, 5.5, 6.0),   # Obstacle 2
        (3.0, 7.0, -1.0, 0.0),   # Obstacle 3
    ]
### Example Response
    There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
    new_path = [
        (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
        (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
        (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
        (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
    ]

[08/21/2024 04:27:48 PM] To plan a path that starts in the given start set and ends in the goal set while avoiding the obstacle and passing through the required breakpoint, we must ensure that our path stays clear of the obstacle and incorporates the necessary waypoints.

### Provided Data:
- **Start Set**: (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
- **Goal Set**: (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.0, 9.0, 0.0, 1.0)
- **Obstacle**: (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) for Obstacle 1 = (4.0, 5.0, -3.0, 4.0)
- **Breakpoints**: Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.0, -4.0), (4.0, 5.0)]

### Path Planning:
1. **Select Start Point**: Choose a point within the start set. Let's pick (0.5, 0.5).
2. **Choose Breakpoint**: We have to pass through one of the breakpoints, either (4.0, -4.0) or (4.0, 5.0). Since (4.0, 5.0) is closer to avoiding the obstacle, we'll select it.
3. **Determine Safe Path**: Ensure the path does not touch or intersect the obstacle. This involves moving around the obstacle while keeping a safe distance from it.
4. **Select Goal Point**: Choose a point within the goal set. Let's pick (8.5, 0.5).

### New Path:
Given the above considerations, the new path could look like this:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point within start set
    (3.0, 5.5),    # Move towards the chosen breakpoint above and safely avoid the top of the obstacle
    (4.0, 5.0),    # Pass through the chosen breakpoint (4.0, 5.0)
    (5.0, 5.5),    # Continue around the obstacle maintaining a safe vertical distance
    (8.5, 0.5)     # End point within goal set
]
```

This path starts in the designated start set, passes through the necessary breakpoints while avoiding the obstacle by staying above it, and concludes in the goal set. It stays clear of the obstacle while ensuring adherence to the task constraints.
