# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (3.0, 7.0, 3.0, 7.0)

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 1.5), (5.12, 8.5)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
    obstacles = [
        (3.0, 3.5, 0.0, 5.0),   # Obstacle 1
        (3.0, 7.0, 5.5, 6.0),   # Obstacle 2
        (3.0, 7.0, -1.0, 0.0),   # Obstacle 3
    ]
### Example Response
    There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
    new_path = [
        (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
        (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
        (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
        (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
    ]

[08/21/2024 10:59:26 AM] To create a safe path that starts within the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids the obstacle, while also passing through a breakpoint, we can follow the below steps:

1. **Choose a Starting Point:** Select a point within the start set.
2. **Navigate to a Breakpoint:** Move towards a breakpoint while ensuring not to touch or intersect with the obstacle.
3. **Navigate to the Goal Set:** Finally, aim towards the goal set while avoiding contact with the obstacle.

### Path Planning
Given the constraints and requirements, we can design the path as follows:

**Start Set:** Choose a starting point within (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0). Let's choose (1.75, 1.75) as the start point.

**Pass through Breakpoint:** We'll use the breakpoint (5.12, 1.5) since it lies outside the obstacle area and is accessible from the start point.

**Avoiding the Obstacle:** Since the obstacle is a large block from (3.0, 7.0, 3.0, 7.0), we must ensure the path circumvents this by staying outside its bounds.

**Goal Set:** Finally, select an endpoint within (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5). For this example, we will use (9.0, 9.0) as the goal point.

### Constructed Path
The path can be represented as follows:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),   # Start point within the start set
    (5.12, 1.5),    # Breakpoint from Set 1
    (8.0, 2.0),     # Navigate around the right side of the obstacle
    (9.0, 9.0)      # End point within the goal set
]
```
This path meets all the requirements: starts in the start set, goes through a breakpoint, avoids the obstacle, and ends in the goal set.
