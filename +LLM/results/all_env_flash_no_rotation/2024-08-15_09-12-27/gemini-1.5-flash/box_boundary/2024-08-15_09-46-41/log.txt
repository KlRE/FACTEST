# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 2: (10.0, 10.1, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 3: (0.0, 10.0, -0.1, 0.0)
			Obstacle 4: (0.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.1)

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 5.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
    Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
    obstacles = [
        (3.0, 3.5, 0.0, 5.0),   # Obstacle 1
        (3.0, 7.0, 5.5, 6.0),   # Obstacle 2
        (3.0, 7.0, -1.0, 0.0),   # Obstacle 3
    ]
### Example Response
    There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
    new_path = [
        (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
        (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
        (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
        (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
    ]

[08/15/2024 09:46:50 AM] Here's a possible path solution, keeping in mind the provided data and requirements:

**Path Strategy:**

1. **Start:** Begin at a point within the start set, such as (1.75, 1.75).
2. **Avoid Obstacle 1:** Move upwards, keeping a safe distance from Obstacle 1, to reach a point above it. For example, (1.75, 2.5).
3. **Towards Breakpoint:** Travel horizontally to reach the breakpoint (5.12, 5.0).
4. **Towards Goal:** Move diagonally upwards to reach a point near the goal set, avoiding Obstacle 4. For example, (8.5, 6.5).
5. **End:**  Finally, move vertically to end within the goal set, for instance, at (8.75, 8.75).

**Path Array:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start
    (1.75, 2.5),   # Avoid Obstacle 1
    (5.12, 5.0),  # Breakpoint
    (8.5, 6.5),   # Towards Goal
    (8.75, 8.75)  # End 
]
```

**Explanation:**

* The path starts within the start set and ends within the goal set.
* It passes through the breakpoint (5.12, 5.0).
* The path avoids crossing any obstacles by maintaining a safe distance.
* The path uses diagonal movements to navigate between waypoints, allowing for flexibility in avoiding obstacles and reaching the goal.

**Important Note:** This is one possible solution. You can adjust the waypoints and path to find other valid solutions. The key is to ensure that the path satisfies all the given requirements, including obstacle avoidance, breakpoint passage, and starting/ending positions.
