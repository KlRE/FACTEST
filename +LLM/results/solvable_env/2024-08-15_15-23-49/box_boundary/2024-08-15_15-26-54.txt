# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 2: (10.0, 10.1, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 3: (0.0, 10.0, -0.1, 0.0)
			Obstacle 4: (0.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.1)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:27:00 PM] ## Step 1: Analyze the start set position
The start set is a rectangular area with coordinates (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0). This means that the start position can be anywhere within this rectangle.

## Step 2: Analyze the goal set position
The goal set is a rectangular area with coordinates (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5). This means that the goal position can be anywhere within this rectangle.

## Step 3: Analyze the obstacles
There are four obstacles, each represented as a rectangular set:
- Obstacle 1: (-0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 10.0)
- Obstacle 2: (10.0, 10.1, 0.0, 10.0)
- Obstacle 3: (0.0, 10.0, -0.1, 0.0)
- Obstacle 4: (0.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.1)

## Step 4: Determine if there is a clear path between the start and goal sets
Looking at the obstacles, we can see that Obstacle 3 blocks the bottom edge of the environment, and Obstacle 4 blocks the top edge. However, there is a gap between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2, which is large enough for a path to pass through.

## Step 5: Check if the path avoids obstacles
Since the start set is at (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0) and the goal set is at (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5), a possible path could be a straight line or a gentle curve that passes through the gap between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2. This path would avoid all obstacles.

## Step 6: Conclusion
Based on the analysis, it appears that there is a possible path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

The final answer is:

- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is not blocked by obstacles, and there is a gap between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2 that allows for a path to pass through. A possible path can be constructed that avoids all obstacles.
- Solvable: True
