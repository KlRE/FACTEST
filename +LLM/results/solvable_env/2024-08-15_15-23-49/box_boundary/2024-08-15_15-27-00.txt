# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 2: (10.0, 10.1, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 3: (0.0, 10.0, -0.1, 0.0)
			Obstacle 4: (0.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.1)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:27:06 PM] ## Chain of Reasoning
The environment consists of a start set, a goal set, and four obstacles that form a rectangular boundary around the environment. The start set is located at the bottom-left corner of the environment, and the goal set is located at the top-right corner. Obstacles 1 and 2 are vertical and located at the left and right edges of the environment, respectively. Obstacles 3 and 4 are horizontal and located at the bottom and top edges of the environment, respectively.

Upon analyzing the environment, it is clear that there is a gap between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3, as well as between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 4. This gap allows for a potential path to be constructed from the start set to the goal set.

Since the start set and goal set are both rectangular, we can choose any point within these sets as the starting and ending points of the path. By selecting a point within the start set that is close to the gap between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3, and a point within the goal set that is close to the gap between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 4, we can construct a path that avoids all obstacles.

By visualizing the environment and the potential path, it becomes clear that there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids all obstacles. This path can be constructed by connecting waypoints that pass through the gaps between the obstacles.
