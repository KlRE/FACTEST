# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 2: (10.0, 10.1, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 3: (0.0, 10.0, -0.1, 0.0)
			Obstacle 4: (0.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.1)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:27:17 PM] ## Chain of Reasoning
The environment consists of a start set, a goal set, and four obstacles that form a rectangular boundary around the environment. The start set is located at the bottom-left corner of the environment, and the goal set is located at the top-right corner. Obstacles 1 and 2 are vertical and located at the left and right edges of the environment, respectively. Obstacles 3 and 4 are horizontal and located at the bottom and top edges of the environment, respectively.

Upon analyzing the environment, it is clear that the start set and goal set are not directly connected by a straight line without intersecting any obstacles. However, there is a possible path that can be constructed by moving around the obstacles.

One possible path is to start at the bottom-left corner of the start set and move upwards until reaching the top edge of the environment, then move rightwards until reaching the goal set. This path avoids obstacles 1 and 3 by moving around them, and it does not intersect with obstacles 2 and 4.

Another possible path is to start at the bottom-left corner of the start set and move rightwards until reaching the right edge of the environment, then move upwards until reaching the goal set. This path avoids obstacles 3 and 4 by moving around them, and it does not intersect with obstacles 1 and 2.

Both of these paths demonstrate that it is possible to construct a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. Therefore, the environment is solvable.
