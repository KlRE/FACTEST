# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 2: (10.0, 10.1, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 3: (0.0, 10.0, -0.1, 0.0)
			Obstacle 4: (0.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.1)
			Obstacle 5: (0.0, 10.0, 4.9, 5.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

## Chain of Reasoning

After examining the environment, it becomes clear that there exists a valid path between the start and goal positions that does not cross any obstacles.


- First, observe the rectangular obstacles along the borders, with some width into the inner area of the space, making the effective available area somewhat smaller.
- Obstacles 3 and 4 act as outer boundaries on the lower and upper edge, which defines a narrower horizontal channel.


Next, the most obstructive set (obstacle 5) along with parts of obstacle 1 (along y-axis), partitions the entire environment, from (x, y) point of view roughly along a y=5 and within y=(1.5 to 9.5).


On top of these static horizontal dividers lies obstacle 5 along x=(0.0 to 10.0) range on the left border that severely blocks almost half the length between our chosen horizontal mid-range 2.


At x = 0 the movement appears strongly hampered (barrier obstacle - between chosen minimum (4.9 - the final Y starting y boundary movement threshold)).
Notice x's apparent marginally smaller, "natural" center obstructed around 5 + 0.1 wide passage obstruction boundary.


- Despite all these blockade constraints, there is still one direction left, along the nearly 10 unit length remaining at 5-Y starting Y starting point boundary after crossing minimum pass margins.


Clearly enough, there exists an unobstructed window above the short 0.1 wide blockade at the pass margin along 8.5 > 5 threshold left for connecting start and goal, the rest of path space should prove easy to consider free and simple travel through using up-to two consecutive linear segments along x-axis. However certain combination or overlap choice travel option - choice margin obstructed. Or Y choice upper margin travel options margin wide enough for different arbitrary and linear Y travel margin option .
