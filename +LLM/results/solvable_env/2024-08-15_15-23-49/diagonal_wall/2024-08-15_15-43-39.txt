# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (4.0, 6.0, -2.0, 0.0)
			Obstacle 2: (2.0, 4.0, 0.0, 2.0)
			Obstacle 3: (0.0, 2.0, 2.0, 4.0)
			Obstacle 4: (-0.1, 0.0, -2.0, 7.0)
			Obstacle 5: (6.0, 6.1, -2.0, 7.0)
			Obstacle 6: (0.0, 6.0, -2.1, -2.0)
			Obstacle 7: (0.0, 6.0, 7.0, 7.1)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:43:45 PM] ## Chain of Reasoning
Analyzing the given environment, we can see that the start set (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0) is located at the bottom left corner, while the goal set (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0) is located at the top right corner. There are several obstacles in between, but there is a clear path that can be taken to reach the goal set without crossing any obstacles.

## Spatial Reasoning
By examining the positions of the obstacles, we can see that Obstacle 1 (4.0, 6.0, -2.0, 0.0) is located below the goal set, Obstacle 2 (2.0, 4.0, 0.0, 2.0) is located below the goal set and to the left of Obstacle 1, Obstacle 3 (0.0, 2.0, 2.0, 4.0) is located above the start set and to the left of Obstacle 2, Obstacle 4 (-0.1, 0.0, -2.0, 7.0) is located to the left of the start set and extends above the goal set, Obstacle 5 (6.0, 6.1, -2.0, 7.0) is located to the right of the goal set and extends below the start set, Obstacle 6 (0.0, 6.0, -2.1, -2.0) is located below the start set and extends to the right of the goal set, and Obstacle 7 (0.0, 6.0, 7.0, 7.1) is located above the goal set and extends to the right of the start set.

## Path Construction
A possible path can be constructed by starting at the bottom left corner of the start set, moving up and to the right to avoid Obstacle 3, then moving up and to the right again to avoid Obstacle 2, and finally moving up and to the right once more to reach the goal set while avoiding Obstacle 1.

## Solvable
Based on the chain of reasoning and spatial reasoning, we can conclude that the environment is indeed solvable.

The final answer is:

- Chain of Reasoning: A path can be constructed by moving up and to the right from the start set, avoiding obstacles and reaching the goal set.
- Solvable: True
