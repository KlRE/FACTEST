# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (4.0, 6.0, -2.0, 0.0)
			Obstacle 2: (2.0, 4.0, 0.0, 2.0)
			Obstacle 3: (0.0, 2.0, 2.0, 4.0)
			Obstacle 4: (-0.1, 0.0, -2.0, 7.0)
			Obstacle 5: (6.0, 6.1, -2.0, 7.0)
			Obstacle 6: (0.0, 6.0, -2.1, -2.0)
			Obstacle 7: (0.0, 6.0, 7.0, 7.1)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:43:51 PM] - Chain of Reasoning: By examining the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles, we can see that the start set is located at (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0) and the goal set is located at (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0). There are obstacles that block a direct path between the start and goal sets. However, we can observe that there is a narrow window of space between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3 that could potentially allow a path to pass through. By moving diagonally upwards and to the right from the start set, it appears that we can avoid the obstacles and reach the goal set. Specifically, we can start at the bottom-right corner of the start set, move diagonally up and to the right to avoid Obstacle 3, then continue moving diagonally up and to the right to avoid Obstacle 2, and finally enter the goal set from the bottom-left corner.
