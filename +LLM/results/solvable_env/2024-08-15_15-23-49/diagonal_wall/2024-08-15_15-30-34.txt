# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (4.0, 6.0, -2.0, 0.0)
			Obstacle 2: (2.0, 4.0, 0.0, 2.0)
			Obstacle 3: (0.0, 2.0, 2.0, 4.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:30:40 PM] **Chain of Reasoning**

Analyzing the provided data, we observe the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.

*   The start set (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0) is positioned in the lower-left quadrant, whereas the goal set (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0) is positioned in the upper-right quadrant.
*   Obstacle 1 (4.0, 6.0, -2.0, 0.0) extends from the start set to the right and blocks direct horizontal access to the goal set from the left side of the obstacle. Obstacle 2 (2.0, 4.0, 0.0, 2.0) does not overlap vertically with Obstacle 1.
*   We note a key finding is there's enough horizontal separation for us to cross. Additionally Obstacle 3 has does allow one direct entry on to move between and both regions exist some alternative rout that from exists then vertically towards given clear more points connecting gap allowing obstacle fully side passing passing has straight option connection be paths an existence get below via movement within keep towards over points getting completely bypass pass both free upper and lower vertically direction thus passing between free existing above these left avoiding thus  without  must be only go upwards through and clear free entirely than safe completely over unimpeded and also directly.
