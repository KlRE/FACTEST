# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.3, 0.7, 0.3, 0.7)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (9.3, 9.7, 0.4, 0.8)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (1.0, 1.2, 0.0, 9.0)
			Obstacle 2: (2.2, 2.4, 0.0, 5.0)
			Obstacle 3: (2.2, 2.4, 6.0, 10.0)

			Obstacle 14: (8.4, 9.3, 3.5, 3.7)
			Obstacle 15: (9.3, 10.0, 2.3, 2.5)
			Obstacle 16: (9.9, 10.0, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 17: (0.0, 0.1, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 18: (0.0, 10.0, 0.0, 0.1)
			Obstacle 19: (0.0, 10.0, 9.9, 10.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:52:49 PM] ## Chain of Reasoning
Upon analyzing the environment, it is evident that the start set (0.3, 0.7, 0.3, 0.7) and the goal set (9.3, 9.7, 0.4, 0.8) are positioned in such a way that there are multiple obstacles between them. However, the key observation is that there are gaps between the obstacles that could potentially allow for a path.

One critical observation is that Obstacle 1 (1.0, 1.2, 0.0, 9.0) and Obstacle 17 (0.0, 0.1, 0.0, 10.0) create a narrow passage on the left side of the environment, but this passage is blocked by other obstacles further down. Similarly, on the right side, there are obstacles like Obstacle 16 (9.9, 10.0, 0.0, 10.0) and Obstacle 19 (0.0, 10.0, 9.9, 10.0) that limit the space for a potential path.

However, focusing on the horizontal movement, it's clear that the obstacles are not solid walls across the entire environment. There are vertical gaps between the obstacles that a path could exploit. For instance, between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2, there is a gap that could be used to move horizontally. Similarly, there are gaps between other obstacles that could be used to navigate around them.

Given the arrangement of the obstacles and the positioning of the start and goal sets, it appears that there is a potential path that could be constructed by carefully navigating through the gaps between the obstacles. This path would require careful planning to avoid crossing any obstacles but does not seem impossible.
