# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.3, 0.7, 0.3, 0.7)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (9.3, 9.7, 0.4, 0.8)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (1.0, 1.2, 0.0, 9.0)
			Obstacle 2: (2.2, 2.4, 0.0, 5.0)
			Obstacle 3: (2.2, 2.4, 6.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 4: (3.4, 3.6, 0.0, 9.0)
			Obstacle 5: (4.6, 4.8, 1.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 6: (5.8, 6.0, 0.0, 6.0)

			Obstacle 13: (9.3, 10.0, 4.7, 4.9)
			Obstacle 14: (8.4, 9.3, 3.5, 3.7)
			Obstacle 15: (9.3, 10.0, 2.3, 2.5)
			Obstacle 16: (9.9, 10.0, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 17: (0.0, 0.1, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 18: (0.0, 10.0, 0.0, 0.1)
			Obstacle 19: (0.0, 10.0, 9.9, 10.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:52:36 PM] ## Chain of Reasoning
The environment is solvable because there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. 

Observing the obstacles, we can see that they are mostly vertical or horizontal rectangles, with some of them being very narrow. The start set is located at (0.3, 0.7, 0.3, 0.7) and the goal set is located at (9.3, 9.7, 0.4, 0.8). 

By analyzing the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles, we can see that there is a possible path that starts in the start set, goes around the obstacles, and ends in the goal set. 

One possible path could be to start in the start set, move upwards to avoid Obstacle 17 and Obstacle 18, then move to the right to avoid Obstacle 1, Obstacle 2, Obstacle 3, Obstacle 4, Obstacle 5, Obstacle 6, Obstacle 7, Obstacle 8, Obstacle 9, Obstacle 10, Obstacle 12, Obstacle 13, Obstacle 14, and Obstacle 15. 

After that, we can move downwards to avoid Obstacle 11 and Obstacle 16, and finally move to the right to reach the goal set. 

This path avoids all obstacles and reaches the goal set, so the environment is solvable.
