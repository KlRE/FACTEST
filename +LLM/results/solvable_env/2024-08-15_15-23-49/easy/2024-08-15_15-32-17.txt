# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (2.0, 4.0, 0.0, 1.0)
			Obstacle 2: (-2.0, 3.0, 2.0, 4.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:32:23 PM] ## Chain of Reasoning

To begin, I analyzed the environment by examining the positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is located at the origin (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0), while the goal set is positioned at a distant location (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0). There are two obstacles in the environment: Obstacle 1 is located at (2.0, 4.0, 0.0, 1.0), and Obstacle 2 is located at (-2.0, 3.0, 2.0, 4.0).

Upon closer inspection, I noticed that Obstacle 1 is situated in a way that blocks the direct path from the start set to the goal set along the x-axis. However, I realized that it is possible to circumvent Obstacle 1 by moving along the y-axis.

I then looked at Obstacle 2 and observed that it is positioned in a way that it does not directly block the path from the start set to the goal set. However, I noted that Obstacle 2 is rather large and could potentially interfere with the path if it is not carefully planned.

Considering these factors, I realized that it is possible to find a path that starts within the start set, ends within the goal set, and avoids both obstacles. For instance, a path could be constructed by starting within the start set, moving along the y-axis to avoid Obstacle 1, and then moving along the x-axis to reach the goal set, keeping a safe distance from Obstacle 2.

## Solvable

Based on my analysis, I conclude that the environment is indeed solvable. There exists a possible path that satisfies the requirements of starting within the start set, ending within the goal set, and avoiding obstacles.

[08/15/2024 03:32:29 PM] - Chain of Reasoning:
The environment is solvable because a path can be found that starts within the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. Observing the given sets and obstacles, it is possible to visualize a path that goes around the obstacles. Starting within the start set (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0), it is feasible to move upwards without hitting Obstacle 2 (-2.0, 3.0, 2.0, 4.0), then proceed to move right to bypass Obstacle 1 (2.0, 4.0, 0.0, 1.0), and then go upwards again towards the goal set (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0). Essentially, since there are no obstacles that completely enclose either the start or goal sets from each other in such a way that no path could be constructed around them, and given the spaces between obstacles allow for such navigation, a path exists.
