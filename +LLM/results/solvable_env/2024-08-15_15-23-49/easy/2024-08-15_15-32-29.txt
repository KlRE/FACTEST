# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (2.0, 4.0, 0.0, 1.0)
			Obstacle 2: (-2.0, 3.0, 2.0, 4.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:32:35 PM] - Chain of Reasoning: Upon analyzing the given environment, it's evident that the start set and goal set are not completely enclosed by obstacles, which leaves open the possibility for a path that does not cross any obstacles. However, considering the placement and dimensions of the obstacles relative to the start and goal sets, we must ensure there is enough space to maneuver around them without intersecting their boundaries.

Starting within the given start set (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0), a path could be conceived that initially moves to the right, bypassing Obstacle 1 (2.0, 4.0, 0.0, 1.0) from below since there's enough vertical space in the start set to avoid it directly. 

Upon further inspection, we realize the main challenge is navigating past the two obstacles in such a way that the path doesn't intersect them and yet ends within the goal set (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0). Considering the relative positions and the non-crossing requirement, the obstacles essentially form a corridor for potential paths to navigate through. Since the path can take on arbitrary directions (not limited to horizontal or vertical), and there is space between the top of Obstacle 1 and the bottom of Obstacle 2 for the path to safely cross without intersecting them, this further supports the possibility of finding a solvable path.

Furthermore, considering the openness of the environment above and below the obstacles and the positioning of the goal set (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0), there appears to be sufficient room to plan a path that safely bypasses both obstacles, avoids intersecting their boundaries, and terminates within the goal set. 

This suggests that a solvable path can be devised under these conditions, affirming that the environment is solvable.
