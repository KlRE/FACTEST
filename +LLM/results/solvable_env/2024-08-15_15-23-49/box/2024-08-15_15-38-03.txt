# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 2: (10.0, 10.1, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 3: (0.0, 10.0, -0.1, 0.0)
			Obstacle 4: (0.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.1)
			Obstacle 5: (4.9, 5.0, 0.0, 10.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:38:09 PM] ## Chain of Reasoning
The given environment consists of a start position, a goal position, and five obstacles. To determine if the environment is solvable, we need to analyze the relative positions of these elements.

First, we observe that Obstacle 5 is situated between the x-coordinates of 4.9 and 5.0, which effectively splits the environment into two separate regions: one to the left of Obstacle 5 and one to the right.

The start position is located in the left region, with x-coordinates between 1.5 and 2.0. The goal position, on the other hand, is situated in the right region, with x-coordinates between 8.5 and 9.5.

Obstacles 1 and 2 are located at the left and right boundaries of the environment, respectively, and do not pose a significant obstacle to reaching the goal set. Obstacles 3 and 4 are located at the top and bottom boundaries, respectively, and also do not pose a significant obstacle.

However, Obstacle 5 creates a narrow passage between the left and right regions. Since the start position is in the left region and the goal position is in the right region, any path that attempts to connect the start and goal positions must pass through this narrow passage.

Given the narrow passage created by Obstacle 5, it is possible to construct a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. For example, a path could start at (1.75, 1.75), move horizontally to (4.95, 1.75), then move vertically to (4.95, 9.25), and finally move horizontally to (9.0, 9.25).
