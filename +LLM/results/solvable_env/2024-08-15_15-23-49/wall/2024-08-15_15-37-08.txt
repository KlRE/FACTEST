# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.0, 9.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (4.0, 5.0, -3.0, 4.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:37:14 PM] ## Chain of Reasoning

Analyzing the given environment, we first observe the relative positions and dimensions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is a rectangle spanning from (0.0, 1.0) horizontally and (0.0, 1.0) vertically. The goal set is positioned significantly further to the right, spanning from (8.0, 9.0) horizontally and (0.0, 1.0) vertically. There is one obstacle set, a rectangle spanning from (4.0, 5.0) horizontally and (-3.0, 4.0) vertically.

Given the dimensions and positions of the start set, goal set, and the obstacle, it seems plausible that a path could be constructed that avoids the obstacle and connects the start set to the goal set. Specifically, since the obstacle's vertical span does not entirely block the path from the start set to the goal set (considering the vertical dimension from -3.0 to 4.0 does not cover the entire y-range of the goal set which spans from 0.0 to 1.0), a path can potentially be routed above or below the obstacle's span.

Moreover, since the start and goal sets are positioned entirely within the same vertical range (0.0 to 1.0), and given that the obstacle does not fully cover this vertical range, there seems to be a straightforward opportunity to navigate around the obstacle. This can be achieved by planning a path that, after leaving the start set, moves vertically to a position that is either above or below the obstacle's vertical span, then proceeds horizontally to the goal set, and finally moves vertically again to enter the goal set.
