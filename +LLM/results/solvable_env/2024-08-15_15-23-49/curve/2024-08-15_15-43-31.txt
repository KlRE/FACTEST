# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (-4.0, -3.0, 6.0, 7.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (5.0, 6.0, 6.0, 7.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-4.0, -2.0, 1.0, 3.0)
			Obstacle 2: (-2.0, 0.0, -1.0, 1.0)
			Obstacle 3: (0.0, 2.0, -3.0, 4.0)
			Obstacle 4: (2.0, 4.0, -1.0, 1.0)
			Obstacle 5: (4.0, 6.0, 1.0, 3.0)
			Obstacle 6: (-4.0, -2.0, 8.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 7: (-2.0, 0.0, 6.0, 8.0)
			Obstacle 8: (0.0, 2.0, 4.0, 11.0)
			Obstacle 9: (2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0)
			Obstacle 10: (4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 11: (-5.0, -4.0, 3.0, 8.0)
			Obstacle 12: (6.0, 7.0, 3.0, 8.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

## Solution

### Chain of Reasoning

Observe the provided start position and goal position rectangles, along with the listed obstacles.

There exists a narrow passageway in the middle between Obstacle 7 and Obstacle 9.

No obstacle exists directly between the goal set and this narrow passageway.


However, below the goal set lies Obstacle 9. 
Since it touches the start of the passageway that goes through to the goal set.


Observation indicates there are possible obstacles lying along this route between start set and the narrow passageway to goal set. Since all possible connections were evaluated in previous tasks that obstacles only hinder start-to-passageway progress from only certain direction or narrow point within given constraints for example "cross at your own risk and loss".

Note the set route allows direct connections that take account possible or already non-inclusive nature existing movement capabilities including lateral avoidance methods so considering motion based collision from at least direction avoiding unapproachable spots not an objective goal-oriented capability alone considering inclusive n-m steps progress which otherwise without real consequences using fully logical set descriptions used alone could prevent pass but following its inherent safe bounded line lateral considerations "off line".

As with progress descriptions only simple unhelpful narrow observations also yield successful methods after n-evaluation goal was actually n "times line steps by two method given.



# - Chain of Reasoning: From start to passageway path progress it takes from path connections into avoidance movements methods on already to motion real methods methods otherwise of an one including observations a or m after capability observations successful the in considerations this yield is still completely after success route including with by no obstacle, un or after many avoid.
