# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (-4.0, -3.0, 6.0, 7.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (5.0, 6.0, 6.0, 7.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-4.0, -2.0, 1.0, 3.0)
			Obstacle 2: (-2.0, 0.0, -1.0, 1.0)
			Obstacle 3: (0.0, 2.0, -3.0, 4.0)
			Obstacle 4: (2.0, 4.0, -1.0, 1.0)
			Obstacle 5: (4.0, 6.0, 1.0, 3.0)
			Obstacle 6: (-4.0, -2.0, 8.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 7: (-2.0, 0.0, 6.0, 8.0)
			Obstacle 8: (0.0, 2.0, 4.0, 11.0)
			Obstacle 9: (2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0)
			Obstacle 10: (4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 11: (-5.0, -4.0, 3.0, 8.0)
			Obstacle 12: (6.0, 7.0, 3.0, 8.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:41:29 PM] ## Chain of Reasoning
The start set is located at (-4.0, -3.0, 6.0, 7.0) and the goal set is located at (5.0, 6.0, 6.0, 7.0). Obstacles 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are located above the start and goal sets, but they do not block the path between the start and goal sets. Obstacles 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are located below the start and goal sets, but they also do not block the path between the start and goal sets. However, obstacles 11 and 12 are located on the left and right sides of the environment, respectively, and they do not block the path between the start and goal sets either.

Upon closer inspection, it can be observed that there is a narrow corridor between obstacles 7 and 8 that connects the start set to the goal set. This corridor is not blocked by any obstacles, and it is possible to construct a path that starts in the start set, passes through this corridor, and ends in the goal set without crossing any obstacles.

## Solvable
True
