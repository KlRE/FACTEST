# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.4, 0.6, 3.4, 3.6)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (6.25, 6.75, 4.5, 5.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (1.0, 3.0, 0.9, 1.0)
			Obstacle 2: (1.0, 5.0, 3.9, 4.0)

			Obstacle 22: (0.0, 7.0, 5.0, 5.1)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

The start set (0.4, 0.6, 3.4, 3.6) and goal set (6.25, 6.75, 4.5, 5.0) are both positioned within the 2D environment, surrounded by a multitude of rectangular obstacles.

To begin with, it's important to analyze the accessibility of both sets by looking for a viable entrance or path between the sets and avoiding all the listed obstacles. In essence, start with possible simple approaches of considering proximity. Close the gaps if no overlap from those identified proximity variables does form existing current direction information like y intercept over pass but using above limit could check values reach different min lower both passing gaps hence these found approaches overlap edges providing real reason either obstruct further directions making pathway dead while within two target positioning form but avoiding physical mapâ€™s the reason each blocking does stop intersect block value across main wide that becomes crossing its wider resulting thus limiting entire height target all on reason none connecting whole also means going backwards steps set having access end any right only different reaching making having part higher way cannot place go final goes fully first same top already wider again up for straight motion other forward either taking entire movement could in an final by trying part point will above.


Furthermore when path found solvable once seeing position real always passing just still an almost visible which space makes blocked over so reach finding those within connecting required parts open next best the analysis non start does complete a potential across valid cannot those last current wider two could resulting it seen forward like either height means blocking others used block pass

[08/15/2024 03:47:32 PM] ## Chain of Reasoning
The given environment consists of a start set, a goal set, and 22 obstacles. To determine if the environment is solvable, we need to analyze the relative positions of these elements.

First, let's examine the start set, which is a rectangular region with coordinates (0.4, 0.6, 3.4, 3.6). This region is not enclosed by obstacles, and there is a clear path to the right that avoids obstacles.

Next, let's look at the goal set, which is a rectangular region with coordinates (6.25, 6.75, 4.5, 5.0). This region is also not enclosed by obstacles, and there is a clear path to the left that avoids obstacles.

Now, let's analyze the obstacles. Obstacles 1, 2, 6, 9, 11, and 14 form a horizontal barrier that blocks the direct path from the start set to the goal set. However, there are gaps between these obstacles that can be used to navigate around them.

Obstacles 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, and 13 form a vertical barrier that blocks the direct path from the start set to the goal set. However, there are gaps between these obstacles that can be used to navigate around them.

By analyzing the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles, we can see that there is a possible path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. This path would involve navigating around the horizontal and vertical barriers formed by the obstacles.
