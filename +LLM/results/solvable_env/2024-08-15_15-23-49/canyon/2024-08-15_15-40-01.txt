# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-2.0, 7.0, 1.0, 3.0)
			Obstacle 2: (-2.0, 7.0, -2.0, 0.0)
			Obstacle 3: (-2.0, -1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
			Obstacle 4: (2.0, 3.0, 0.0, 1.0)
			Obstacle 5: (6.0, 7.0, 0.0, 1.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:40:07 PM] ## Analysis

Upon analyzing the given environment, we observe the following:

1.  The start set (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0) is situated at the leftmost part of the environment with no obstacles blocking its right side.
2.  The goal set (4.0, 5.0, 0.0, 1.0) is located to the right of the start set with obstacles positioned in between.
3.  There is a clear vertical path (i.e., where x remains constant) that exists between the start and goal set, avoiding obstacles along the y-axis. However, moving horizontally along the x-axis between the start and goal set would require traversing around obstacles.
4.  By visualizing the environment, we notice that Obstacle 4 (2.0, 3.0, 0.0, 1.0) directly blocks the path between the start and goal set along the x-axis. However, there is a gap above Obstacle 4 that allows for a path to be constructed by moving vertically upwards from the start set, then horizontally to the right, and finally vertically downwards to the goal set.

## Chain of Reasoning

Given the observations above, we can deduce the following chain of reasoning:

*   The start set is not enclosed by obstacles, allowing for a path to be constructed that moves away from the start set.
*   There exists a gap above Obstacle 4 that allows for a path to be constructed by moving vertically upwards from the start set, then horizontally to the right, and finally vertically downwards to the goal set.
*   This path avoids crossing any obstacles, as it moves around them by utilizing the available vertical and horizontal space.

## Solvable

Based on the chain of reasoning provided, we conclude that the environment is indeed solvable.

- Chain of Reasoning: A path exists that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles by moving vertically upwards, then horizontally to the right, and finally vertically downwards.
- Solvable: True
