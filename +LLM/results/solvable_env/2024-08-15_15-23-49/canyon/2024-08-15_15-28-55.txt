# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-2.0, 7.0, 1.0, 3.0)
			Obstacle 2: (-2.0, 7.0, -2.0, 0.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:29:01 PM] ## Chain of Reasoning
Upon analyzing the environment, we observe that the start set (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0) and the goal set (4.0, 5.0, 0.0, 1.0) are positioned in a way that they do not overlap with the obstacles. However, the obstacles (Obstacle 1: (-2.0, 7.0, 1.0, 3.0) and Obstacle 2: (-2.0, 7.0, -2.0, 0.0)) create a barrier between the start and goal sets. Specifically, Obstacle 1 blocks the path from the start set to the goal set in the y-direction, and Obstacle 2 blocks the path in the negative y-direction.

## Spatial Reasoning
Further analysis reveals that there is a small window of opportunity to navigate around the obstacles. Since the start set is positioned at (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0), we can start the path at the bottom-right corner of the start set (1.0, 0.0). From there, we can navigate around Obstacle 2 by moving in the positive x-direction until we reach the x-coordinate of the goal set (4.0). Then, we can move in the positive y-direction to reach the goal set.

## Solvable
Based on the chain of reasoning and spatial reasoning, we conclude that the environment is indeed solvable.

- Chain of Reasoning: The analysis reveals that while the obstacles create a barrier between the start and goal sets, there is a narrow window of opportunity to navigate around them, making it possible to reach the goal set without crossing any obstacles.
- Solvable: True
