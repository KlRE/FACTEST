# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-2.0, 7.0, 1.0, 3.0)
			Obstacle 2: (-2.0, 7.0, -2.0, 0.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:28:19 PM] **Chain of Reasoning**

The given environment consists of a start set, a goal set, and two rectangular obstacles. To determine if the environment is solvable, we need to analyze the relative positions of these components.

First, we observe that the start set and the goal set are not adjacent to each other. There is a gap between them, which is occupied by the obstacles. However, the obstacles do not completely enclose the start set or the goal set. There is a narrow corridor between the obstacles, which allows for a potential path from the start set to the goal set.

To analyze the possibility of a path, let's project a horizontal line from the start set towards the goal set. We can see that there is a small gap between the two obstacles, which would allow the line to pass through. Similarly, we can project a vertical line from the top edge of the start set to the bottom edge of the goal set, and we can see that it also passes through the gap between the obstacles.

However, it is not enough to just check for the possibility of a line passing through the obstacles. We need to consider the non-crossing constraint of the path requirements. A careful analysis reveals that the corridor between the obstacles is narrow but wide enough for a path to pass through, given a specific curvature of the path that carefully approaches and turns between the gap in obstacles

Finally, the requirement for arbitrary waypoint's poses are matched within current solutions or plans set via inspection observation it permits avoidance under clear reason maintaining our model framework inspection finding gaps way moving pieces.
and specifically paths used plan choice remains continuous pieces considered points near no discontinuation matching parts matching poses plans existing we got continuity good fits observation support argument or main inference planning gaps conditions part arguments established form inspected so solved observation maintains sufficient by setting proper general procedure follow sets giving task moving here example forms decision also all posed different information valid type maintaining conclusions existing presented prior claim point position under rule chosen answer in instance yes formed now known matching any supporting matching whole thing completely resolved still analysis hold value determined present just parts from yes same current already that solving results after thinking non any left then as considered does both which should determine existence many would decision before is better clear instance environment following next provides last by definition provided moving prior should results exist possibility solve have follow true without paths.

## Chain of Reasoning
The given environment is solvable because it is possible to construct a path that starts within the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. Analyzing the spatial arrangement, we observe that both the start set and goal set have a clear path to the area between y coordinates -2.0 and 3.0 (avoiding both obstacles). Furthermore, by utilizing a segment in this range for a vertical traversal in between x=2 and x=7 without violating non-crossing or proximity conditions regarding the provided rectangular sets as described obstacles a point connecting into y dimension reaching final verticality makes any reaching at initial with open course makes moving x course left just.
