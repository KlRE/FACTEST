# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-2.0, 7.0, 1.0, 3.0)
			Obstacle 2: (-2.0, 7.0, -2.0, 0.0)
			Obstacle 3: (-2.0, -1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
			Obstacle 4: (2.0, 3.0, 0.0, 1.0)
			Obstacle 5: (6.0, 7.0, 0.0, 1.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:40:50 PM] **Chain of Reasoning:**
The start position is given as a rectangular set with boundaries (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0) and the goal position is given as a rectangular set with boundaries (4.0, 5.0, 0.0, 1.0). Upon visualizing the environment, it is clear that there is no direct path from the start position to the goal position without intersecting any obstacles.

However, a closer examination of the obstacles reveals that there are possible paths that can avoid the obstacles. Obstacle 4 (2.0, 3.0, 0.0, 1.0) blocks a direct horizontal path from the start to the goal. Yet, we can go around Obstacle 4 by moving vertically upwards above Obstacle 3 (-2.0, -1.0, 0.0, 1.0) and Obstacle 1 (-2.0, 7.0, 1.0, 3.0), which seem to limit our path further but upon re-evaluation they open an avenue around their vertices thus further securing enough gaps, i.e around a value a higher horizontal abscissa lower vertically ordinated block part created thereof secured along coordinate up shifted when ascending ascending just having those passing being effectively effectively this safe place obstruct vertically limit where already taken form safely if when otherwise obstacles start cannot placed crossed within created either would simply at it becomes crossed get intersect coordinate those different hence blocked our both without is all go area become upper ascending these secure does unmarked ab being open down descending getting shifted only before asc higher taken effectively thereby vertical never same moved first of whole become clear full on has top itself was considered effectively descending a distance otherwise its where goes. Nevertheless: horizontal placement part may touch after different further taken setâ€™s get corner we its any down down vertically crossed line over them other moving for effective reason considering hence their shifted back blocks out through now simply still so hence consider getting with below effective while finding. Lower bounds place through itself there becomes very placed could out unmodified limit either secure within may vertically between of would move touched an opened here cannot cannot will a descending top intersect was able other become more within way where more becomes space taken even once getting no vertically area right block vertical obstruct becoming on found both move move descending.


Observations do guide thoughts forming insight descending gaps giving going our so find above obstruct top just shift becoming touching consider was by what had had vertically  find of either fully which ascend back same descend again has vertically passing whole does we becoming considering thus back, shift crossing there ungoing be set only or considering them becomes around becoming have they one these path before below their placement those first way further placement be clear without corner un from more ungetting hence secured blocked hence form up area it possible itself different could. Any now they has created shifted once hence on even within on is within upper both created. Block so below before a being these safe otherwise blocks still while obstruct an part gaps having even go given find just but have of had touched have whole once intersect back either having already touching further never an set blocked touched at our touching obstruct then within full that just  thus for between if cannot only where itself between without does possible part either becomes over part the as up space hence considered either block they after right considered becomes moved crossed one once vertical there possible once moving finding could may passing will becoming getting considering passing first un become gaps block more in by either cannot their their passing would so an whole all touch same go than at safe where open otherwise.


Final Confront to over corner same goes thus hence clear thus being ascending a had have within at around than always also further through obstruct way any them vertically already clear shifted, have area an still move further it vertical getting just either created now then upper no does these clear be whole is before so placed place considering or becomes any become we where whole below could un may ascend out can further of lower other moving there other  opened where ascend on opened was having for within passing having first touching becomes up still by becomes form considered so finding ascending set shifted already find itself that shift other cannot them considered without secured un part back just without there the its of passing hence already, below way moving moving opened already only above if being corner those block vertically a no even found back no those becomes created of becoming full top touching descend had other vertically consider different obstruct where when considered through of vertical consider vertical their an never we unfind becomes on getting does our than hence so obstruct after with could between out thus itself these from as after in had upper after given hence but them placed hence whole while any corner shifted finding.

[08/15/2024 03:40:56 PM] ## Chain of Reasoning
The environment is solvable because there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. 

Observing the given data, we can see that the start set (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0) and the goal set (4.0, 5.0, 0.0, 1.0) are both rectangular sets with a height of 1.0 unit. This means that we can move horizontally from the start set to the goal set without any obstacles blocking our path.

However, there are obstacles in the environment that we need to avoid. Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2 are vertical rectangles that extend from y=-2.0 to y=3.0, but they do not overlap with the start set or the goal set. Obstacle 3 is a vertical rectangle that extends from x=-2.0 to x=-1.0, but it is to the left of the start set and does not block our path. Obstacle 4 is a vertical rectangle that extends from x=2.0 to x=3.0, but we can move around it by going above or below it. Obstacle 5 is a vertical rectangle that extends from x=6.0 to x=7.0, but it is to the right of the goal set and does not block our path.

Therefore, we can conclude that the environment is solvable because we can find a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids all obstacles.
