# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-2.0, 7.0, 1.0, 3.0)
			Obstacle 2: (-2.0, 7.0, -2.0, 0.0)
			Obstacle 3: (-2.0, -1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
			Obstacle 4: (2.0, 3.0, 0.0, 1.0)
			Obstacle 5: (6.0, 7.0, 0.0, 1.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:40:13 PM] **Chain of Reasoning:**

Analyzing the environment, I notice that the start set (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0) and goal set (4.0, 5.0, 0.0, 1.0) are both rectangular sets that do not overlap with any obstacles. However, I also observe that the space between the start set and goal set is partially obstructed by Obstacle 4 (2.0, 3.0, 0.0, 1.0) and Obstacle 5 (6.0, 7.0, 0.0, 1.0).

Despite the presence of these obstacles, I realize that there is a narrow corridor between the obstacles that allows for a potential path from the start set to the goal set. Specifically, I can envision a path that starts within the start set, moves horizontally to the right, avoids Obstacle 4 by passing above or below it, and then continues horizontally to the goal set, avoiding Obstacle 5.

Additionally, I consider the possibility of a path that goes around the obstacles. For example, a path could start in the start set, move downwards to avoid Obstacle 1 (-2.0, 7.0, 1.0, 3.0), then move horizontally to the right, and finally move upwards to reach the goal set. This path would require navigating around the obstacles, but it appears to be feasible.

**Solvable:** True

My chain of reasoning suggests that there are potential paths that can connect the start set to the goal set while avoiding obstacles. While I have not explicitly defined a path, my analysis indicates that the environment is solvable.
