# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-2.0, 7.0, 1.0, 3.0)
			Obstacle 2: (-2.0, 7.0, -2.0, 0.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

To determine if the environment is solvable, I will analyze the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles. First, I observe that the start set is a rectangular area from (0.0, 1.0) on the x-axis and (0.0, 1.0) on the y-axis. The goal set is also a rectangular area from (4.0, 5.0) on the x-axis and (0.0, 1.0) on the y-axis.

Looking at the obstacles, I see that there are two rectangular sets that can potentially block the path. Obstacle 1 has a rectangular area from (-2.0, 7.0) on the x-axis and (1.0, 3.0) on the y-axis. Obstacle 2 has a rectangular area from (-2.0, 7.0) on the x-axis and (-2.0, 0.0) on the y-axis.

Given these positions, I notice that there is a horizontal strip from (1.0, 3.0) on the y-axis where neither obstacle 1 nor obstacle 2 is present. Since both the start and goal sets are partially or entirely within the range (0.0, 1.0) on the y-axis, a possible path could exist within this strip. I do not see any obstacle blocking a potential path between the start set and goal set when traveling horizontally along the x-axis, starting within the (0.0, 1.0) y-axis range of the start set.

Furthermore, neither obstacle vertically encloses the space along the entire length from the start to the goal along this range of y. As the environment space where these obstacle resides ends above y 1 - which indicates a linear path can connect (the set of points [((x=1), y=(0.75)) 0 <= x <= 4]) - touching and staying within allowed boundaries defined by each set - this satisfies our path obligations, if considered alone this fully supports that there exists a solution - through careful selection and application of a continuous motion line, and particularly no crossing points where said line segments when fully applied is completely confined within allowable parameter spaces.

**Solvable**

- Solvable: **True**

(I assumed 0.75 for "y value" for a point within the selected y range. Consider a point that does not result in crossing e.g from ((3/4).
