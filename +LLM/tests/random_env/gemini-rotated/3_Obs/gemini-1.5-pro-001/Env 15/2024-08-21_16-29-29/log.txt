# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[12.2, 17.3], [17.5, 15.8], [17.9, 18.9], [14.6, 19.9]]
			Obstacle 2: [[8.0, 17.6], [15.0, 15.5], [16.8, 17.1], [16.0, 17.2]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 7.65), (9.0, 19.77)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:30:03 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 2.  We can achieve this by navigating around the obstacle.

Starting from the last valid waypoint (7.0, 3.0), we can steer clear of Obstacle 2 by moving eastward before heading north towards the breakpoint (9.0, 19.77).

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0), 
    (7.0, 3.0), 
    (10.0, 3.0),  # Move east, clearing Obstacle 2
    (10.0, 19.77), # Move north to the breakpoint 
    (17.0, 19.0), 
    (20.0, 19.0)
]
```

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[12.2, 17.3], [17.5, 15.8], [17.9, 18.9], [14.6, 19.9]]
			Obstacle 2: [[8.0, 17.6], [15.0, 15.5], [16.8, 17.1], [16.0, 17.2]]
			Obstacle 3: [[13.0, 4.8], [16.7, 0.1], [19.3, 12.0], [14.7, 8.6]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 7.65), (9.0, 19.77)]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.0, 2.0), (7.0, 3.0), (10.0, 3.0), (10.0, 19.77), (17.0, 19.0), (20.0, 19.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 3 between points (10.0, 3.0) and (10.0, 19.77) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 2: [[8.0, 17.6], [15.0, 15.5], [16.8, 17.1], [16.0, 17.2]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(1.0, 2.0), (7.0, 3.0), (10.0, 3.0)]
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Missing breakpoint sets:
 		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 7.65), (9.0, 19.77)]
	

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:30:11 PM] The current path collides because it tries to move directly upwards to the breakpoint. To avoid this, we should navigate around obstacle 2. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0),  # Start within the start set
    (7.0, 3.0),  # Continue from the valid subpath 
    (7.0, 14.0), # Move upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 2 
    (9.0, 14.0), # Move right, towards Breakpoint Set 1 
    (9.0, 19.77),# Reach the breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1
    (17.0, 19.0),# Move towards the goal set
    (20.0, 19.0)  # End within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Start:** We begin at the same starting point as the previous path.
2. **Navigate around Obstacle 2:** Instead of going directly upwards, we first move right to x=7.0.  Then, we move upwards to y=14.0, staying clear of Obstacle 2. 
3. **Reach Breakpoint:** From there, we can safely move right to x=9.0, reaching the second breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1.
4. **Goal Approach:**  Finally, we move towards the goal set, ensuring we stay clear of any obstacles.

This adjusted path avoids all obstacles while passing through a breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1.

[08/21/2024 04:30:16 PM] The current path collides with Obstacle 2 because it tries to go almost vertically upwards from the breakpoint (9.0, 14.0).

    (7.0, 14.0),
