# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 17.1], [8.2, 10.8], [6.9, 14.8], [2.5, 19.5]]
			Obstacle 2: [[17.1, 17.3], [5.8, 18.9], [5.9, 17.6], [8.0, 16.3]]
			Obstacle 3: [[12.0, 15.2], [18.2, 13.8], [17.8, 19.6], [12.9, 17.9]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 7.2), (9.0, 20.22)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:18:08 PM] A viable path can be visualized by weaving through the spaces between the obstacles.

**Chosen Breakpoint:** (9.0, 7.2) from Breakpoint Set 1

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (8.0, 6.0),    # Approach the breakpoint while avoiding Obstacle 1
    (9.0, 7.2),    # Pass through the chosen breakpoint
    (10.0, 8.0),   # Maneuver around Obstacle 2
    (11.0, 12.0),  # Ascend towards the goal while avoiding Obstacle 3
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(1.0, 1.0) to (8.0, 6.0):** This segment starts within the start set and moves towards the breakpoint, carefully navigating below the lower vertex of Obstacle 1.
2. **(8.0, 6.0) to (9.0, 7.2):** This segment directly passes through the chosen breakpoint.
3. **(9.0, 7.2) to (10.0, 8.0):**  This segment begins the maneuver around Obstacle 2, staying clear of its bottom-left corner.
4. **(10.0, 8.0) to (11.0, 12.0):** This segment continues to navigate around Obstacle 2 and starts ascending towards the goal set, ensuring a safe distance from Obstacle 3's left side.
5. **(11.0, 12.0) to (19.0, 19.0):** This final segment moves directly toward the center of the goal set, well clear of all obstacles.

This path avoids all obstacles while successfully connecting the start and goal sets via the chosen breakpoint.

[08/21/2024 04:18:14 PM] The last valid subpath successfully navigated to the first breakpoint set. Let's carefully plan a path around obstacles 2 and 3 to reach the goal set.  

Moving directly right from (11.0, 12.0) towards the goal will lead to a collision with obstacle 3. A safer approach is to navigate below obstacles 2 and 3. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (8.0, 6.0), 
    (9.0, 7.2), 
    (10.0, 8.0), 
    (11.0, 12.0), 
    (13.0, 12.0), # Move right, staying below obstacle 3
    (13.0, 14.0), # Move up, staying left of obstacle 3
    (16.0, 14.0), # Move right, staying below obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Move diagonally to the goal 
]
```

This path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles while successfully reaching the goal set.

[08/21/2024 04:18:22 PM] The issue arises when the path tries to directly connect to the goal set from waypoint (16.0, 14.0). To circumvent this, we can utilize the top breakpoint of Breakpoint Set 1, (9.0, 20.22). 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

1. **From the last valid point (16.0, 14.0):** We need to navigate around Obstacle 3.
2. **Move upwards:**  A waypoint like (16.0, 20.0) takes us above Obstacle 3.
3. **Connect to breakpoint:** Move horizontally to the breakpoint (9.0, 20.22). 
4. **Proceed to goal:** From the breakpoint, there's a clear path to the goal set. A waypoint like (19.0, 20.0) positions us well.
5. **Enter goal set:** Finally, move down into the goal set, for example, to (19.0, 19.0).

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [(1.0, 1.0), (8.0, 6.0), (9.0, 7.2), (10.0, 8.0), (11.0, 12.0), (13.0, 12.0), (13.0, 14.0), (16.0, 14.0), (16.0, 20.0), (9.0, 20.22), (19.0, 20.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:18:29 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid obstacles 2 and 3. Since the problematic segment is vertical, we can try going around the obstacles horizontally. 

From the last valid waypoint (16.0, 14.0), we can move eastward to a point with x-coordinate greater than 18.2 (the rightmost point of obstacle 3).  Then, we can move north to bypass obstacle 2, and finally head towards the goal point.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (8.0, 6.0), 
    (9.0, 7.2), 
    (10.0, 8.0), 
    (11.0, 12.0), 
    (13.0, 12.0), 
    (13.0, 14.0), 
    (16.0, 14.0),  
    (18.5, 14.0), # move east, clearing obstacle 3
    (18.5, 20.5), # move north, clearing obstacle 2
    (19.0, 20.0) # reach the goal set

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.

[08/21/2024 04:18:35 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 3. We can achieve this by routing the path above this obstacle. Since the path already reaches a y-coordinate of 14.0, we can extend it horizontally at this height towards the goal.

Here's the adjusted path:

[08/21/2024 04:19:04 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 3. Since the valid subpath ends at a y-coordinate of 14.0,  it's strategic to route the path above Obstacle 3, considering its highest point is at y = 19.6. 

Here's a possible adjustment:

1. **Continue from the valid subpath:** Keep the path until the point (16.0, 14.0). 
2. **Navigate above Obstacle 3:**  Introduce waypoints to guide the path above Obstacle 3. For instance, (16.0, 20.0) and (17.0, 20.0) would safely clear the obstacle.
3. **Reach the goal set:** Finally, connect to the goal set with a waypoint like (18.5, 20.0) and then to the final point within the goal set, (19.0, 19.0). 

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [(1.0, 1.0), (8.0, 6.0), (9.0, 7.2), (10.0, 8.0), (11.0, 12.0), (13.0, 12.0), (13.0, 14.0), (16.0, 14.0), (16.0, 20.0), (17.0, 20.0), (18.5, 20.0), (19.0, 19.0)]
