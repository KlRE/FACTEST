# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.4, 11.1], [15.5, 8.9], [19.4, 8.8], [19.2, 9.6]]
			Obstacle 2: [[15.0, 13.4], [6.9, 5.2], [11.5, 5.9], [19.1, 11.6]]
			Obstacle 3: [[17.6, 19.8], [15.3, 19.1], [15.4, 11.6], [15.8, 6.7]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 1.76), (9.0, 14.66)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 1.76)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:

        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

### Provided Data

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:31:11 PM] The current path fails because it tries to move directly upwards to the second waypoint, colliding with Obstacle 2. Instead, we should navigate around this obstacle. We can do this by first moving to the right, going around Obstacle 2, and then heading upwards to reach the goal set. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 1.76),   # Pass through the breakpoint 
    (14.0, 1.76),  # Move rightwards, staying clear of Obstacle 2
    (14.0, 19.0),  # Move upwards, safely away from all obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Reach the goal within the goal set 
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles by first maneuvering around Obstacle 2 on the right side and then proceeding upwards.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:31:19 PM] The current path collides with Obstacle 2 because it attempts to go straight up at x = 14. We need to adjust the path to navigate around this obstacle.

One strategy is to go around the left side of Obstacle 2. To do this, we can:

1.  **Keep the initial segment:** The segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (9.0, 1.76) is valid.
2.  **Move horizontally to the left:** Instead of going straight up, we can move further left to avoid Obstacle 2 entirely. A safe x-coordinate could be around x = 6.0 (considering the coordinates of Obstacle 2).
3.  **Move vertically upwards:** Once we are safely to the left of Obstacle 2, we can move upwards to a y-coordinate greater than the obstacle's highest point (y = 13.4).
4.  **Move horizontally towards the goal:** Finally, we can move rightwards to reach the goal area.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, 1.76), 
    (6.0, 1.76),  # Move left
    (6.0, 14.0),  # Move up, clearing Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 14.0), # Move right
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Move up to the goal
]
```

This new path avoids all obstacles while passing through the required breakpoints and reaching the goal area.

Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:31:23 PM] The initial path went too far to the left before heading towards the goal, leading to the collision with Obstacle 3. Let's adjust the path to stay to the right of Obstacle 3. We can accomplish this by routing the path upwards before the x-coordinate of Obstacle 3 and then navigating towards the goal. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 1.76),  # Pass through the breakpoint
    (9.0, 14.0), # Move upwards to avoid Obstacle 3 
    (19.0, 14.0), # Move right towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End within the goal set
]

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.4, 11.1], [15.5, 8.9], [19.4, 8.8], [19.2, 9.6]]
			Obstacle 2: [[15.0, 13.4], [6.9, 5.2], [11.5, 5.9], [19.1, 11.6]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 1.76), (9.0, 14.66)]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 1.76), (9.0, 14.0), (19.0, 14.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 2 between points (9.0, 1.76) and (9.0, 14.0) intersects with obstacle(s):

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 1.76)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

[08/21/2024 04:32:04 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid Obstacle 2.  We can achieve this by routing the path around the right side of the obstacle.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 1.76),  # Use the first breakpoint
    (11.0, 1.76), # Move right to avoid the leftmost point of Obstacle 2
    (11.0, 14.0), # Move upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 2 
    (19.0, 14.0), # Move right towards the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Reach the goal set
]
```

Explanation:

1. **(1.0, 1.0) -> (9.0, 1.76):** This segment is valid as confirmed by the feedback.
2. **(9.0, 1.76) -> (11.0, 1.76):** This new segment moves horizontally to the right, avoiding Obstacle 2.
3. **(11.0, 1.76) -> (11.0, 14.0):**  This segment moves vertically upwards, staying clear of the rightmost points of Obstacle 2.
4. **(11.0, 14.0) -> (19.0, 14.0):** This segment moves horizontally towards the goal set, remaining clear of obstacles.
5. **(19.0, 14.0) -> (19.0, 19.0):** This final segment moves vertically to reach the desired endpoint within the goal set.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:32:11 PM] The issue arises when the path tries to move upward from (11.0, 1.76) to (11.0, 14.0), directly clashing with Obstacle 2. To circumvent this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle.

Here's a possible adjustment:

1. **Utilize the Valid Subpath:** We keep the valid subpath [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 1.76), (11.0, 1.76)].

2. **Navigate Around Obstacle 2:**  Instead of moving straight up, we need to guide the path around the obstacle.
    - Move rightward, increasing the x-coordinate to bypass the obstacle's rightmost edge.
    - Once clear of Obstacle 2, move upwards towards the goal.

3. **Proceed to Goal:** With Obstacle 2 cleared, the path can then proceed horizontally towards the goal set.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  
    (9.0, 1.76), 
    (11.0, 1.76), 
    (19.5, 1.76),  // Move right, clearing Obstacle 2
    (19.5, 19.0), // Move upwards towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)  // Move into the goal set
]
```
