# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.6, 10.8], [14.3, 14.0], [7.3, 14.8], [3.6, 12.7]]
			Obstacle 2: [[19.0, 8.6], [15.5, 5.1], [16.1, 0.6], [17.6, 4.4]]
			Obstacle 3: [[6.2, 13.5], [16.3, 10.7], [19.1, 16.7], [6.8, 14.2]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 5.33), (9.0, 18.32)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:21:11 PM] A possible path could navigate above obstacles 1 and 3, then proceed towards the goal.

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0),  # Start within the start set
    (8.0, 19.0),  # Navigate above obstacles 1 and 3, passing through breakpoint (9.0, 18.32) in Breakpoint Set 1
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set
]
``` 

**Explanation:**

*  **(1.0, 2.0):** Starts within the start set.
*  **(8.0, 19.0):**  Moves the path safely above obstacles 1 and 3. This waypoint also ensures the path passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 18.32) in Breakpoint Set 1.
*  **(19.0, 19.0):** This waypoint leads the path to the goal set, ending within its boundaries.

**Important:** 

This is a visual interpretation and may not be perfectly accurate.  It's crucial to verify the path's safety using precise calculations and considering potential tolerances around obstacles.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:21:14 PM] The initial path goes directly through obstacle 1. To avoid this, we can route the path below obstacle 1. 

The breakpoint (9.0, 5.33) lies in a space free from obstacles, so we can route the path through it. 

From (9.0, 5.33) we can move directly to the goal set.

new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0), 
    (9.0, 5.33), 
    (19.0, 19.0)

]

[08/21/2024 04:21:20 PM] The proposed path collides with Obstacle 3 because it attempts to move directly from the breakpoint to the goal. To circumvent this, we can add a waypoint to navigate around Obstacle 3.

Here's how we can adjust the path:

1. **Start at the valid subpath:** We'll keep the first two points of the original path, as they are valid and avoid obstacles.
2. **Navigate around Obstacle 3:** Instead of going directly to the goal, we'll add a waypoint to the right of Obstacle 3.
3. **Proceed to the goal:** From the new waypoint, we can move directly to the goal without encountering any obstacles.

Following this approach, the revised path would be:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0), 
    (9.0, 5.33), 
    (17.0, 5.33), # New waypoint to the right of Obstacle 3

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:21:23 PM] The path needs to navigate around Obstacle 2 to reach the goal. One option is to route the path above this obstacle.

new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0),  # Start in the start set
    (9.0, 5.33), # Pass through the breakpoint
    (9.0, 10.0), # Move upwards to a point above Obstacle 2
    (17.0, 10.0), # Move rightwards to a point above the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Move downwards to end in the goal set 
]

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.6, 10.8], [14.3, 14.0], [7.3, 14.8], [3.6, 12.7]]
			Obstacle 2: [[19.0, 8.6], [15.5, 5.1], [16.1, 0.6], [17.6, 4.4]]
			Obstacle 3: [[6.2, 13.5], [16.3, 10.7], [19.1, 16.7], [6.8, 14.2]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 5.33), (9.0, 18.32)]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.0, 2.0), (9.0, 5.33), (9.0, 10.0), (17.0, 10.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 4 between points (17.0, 10.0) and (19.0, 19.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 3: [[6.2, 13.5], [16.3, 10.7], [19.1, 16.7], [6.8, 14.2]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(1.0, 2.0), (9.0, 5.33), (9.0, 10.0), (17.0, 10.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:21:29 PM] The issue lies in the final segment of the path attempting to directly connect to the goal through Obstacle 3. 

Instead of this approach, we can leverage the valid subpath provided. Let's add a waypoint to navigate around Obstacle 3:

1. **Valid Subpath End:** The last valid point is (17.0, 10.0).

2. **Circumventing Obstacle 3:**  Obstacle 3's highest y-coordinate is 16.7.  We can add a waypoint above this, such as (17.0, 17.0), to safely clear the obstacle.

3. **Reaching the Goal:** From (17.0, 17.0), a clear path exists to enter the goal set. We can choose (19.0, 19.0) as the final waypoint.

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [(1.0, 2.0), (9.0, 5.33), (9.0, 10.0), (17.0, 10.0), (17.0, 17.0), (19.0, 19.0)]
```
