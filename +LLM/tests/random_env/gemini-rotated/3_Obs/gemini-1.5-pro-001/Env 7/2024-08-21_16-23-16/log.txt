# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[11.9, 17.8], [14.0, 11.0], [17.2, 12.7], [17.2, 15.9]]
			Obstacle 2: [[18.4, 15.5], [17.7, 18.8], [17.8, 16.6], [18.2, 15.7]]
			Obstacle 3: [[15.1, 19.1], [16.1, 15.1], [18.7, 16.8], [18.5, 17.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 10.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:23:24 PM] Here's a possible path considering the obstacles and breakpoints:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start inside the start quadrilateral
    (9.0, 10.0),   # Pass through Breakpoint Set 1 
    (10.0, 13.0),  # Navigate around the left side of Obstacle 1
    (16.0, 14.0),  # Move towards the goal, staying below Obstacles 2 & 3
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End inside the goal quadrilateral 
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(1.0, 1.0):** Starts within the start quadrilateral.
2. **(9.0, 10.0):**  Directly targets the Breakpoint Set 1.
3. **(10.0, 13.0):**  Moves upward and slightly to the left to begin navigating around Obstacle 1. 
4. **(16.0, 14.0):** Continues rightward, maintaining a safe distance below Obstacles 2 and 3.
5. **(19.0, 19.0):**  Moves directly into the goal quadrilateral.

**Important:** This path avoids directly approaching the tight spaces between obstacles, ensuring a safer trajectory.

[08/21/2024 04:24:01 PM] The current path collides with Obstacle 1 because it attempts to move directly towards the goal region without accounting for the obstacle's position.  We need to adjust the path to navigate around Obstacle 1.

Since we already have a valid path to the breakpoint (9.0, 10.0), let's continue from there. 

Obstacle 1's lowest point is at approximately (14.0, 11.0).  To avoid it, we can direct our path south of this point. A possible waypoint could be (13.0, 10.0). From there, we can proceed towards the goal region.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, 10.0), 
    (13.0, 10.0), # Navigate south of Obstacle 1
    (16.0, 14.0), # Approach the goal region 
    (19.0, 19.0)

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:24:15 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid obstacles 2 and 3. Currently, the path attempts to move directly from (16.0, 8.0) to the goal, cutting through these obstacles.

Let's reroute the path from the last valid waypoint (16.0, 8.0) to navigate around these obstacles:

1. **From (16.0, 8.0):** We can move horizontally to the right, staying clear of obstacle 3. A safe waypoint could be (17.0, 8.0), maintaining a safe distance from obstacle 3's x-coordinates.

2. **From (17.0, 8.0):**  Now we can move upwards, aiming to go above obstacle 2.  Let's target a waypoint like (17.0, 19.0). This positions us directly above obstacle 2 and clear of obstacle 3.

3. **From (17.0, 19.0):**  A simple move to the right will bring us into the goal set. (19.0, 19.0) is a good choice as it lies within the goal set.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 10.0), (13.0, 10.0), (13.0, 8.0), (16.0, 8.0), (17.0, 8.0), (17.0, 19.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:24:27 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid obstacles 2 and 3. Since the path currently gets blocked at (18.0, 14.0), adding waypoints to circumnavigate the obstacles from there would be suitable.

New Path:

```
new_path = [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 10.0), (13.0, 10.0), (13.0, 8.0), (16.0, 8.0), (17.0, 8.0), (18.0, 8.0), (18.0, 14.0), (17.5, 14.0), (17.5, 19.0), (18.0, 19.0), (19.0, 19.0)]
```

Explanation of Changes:

1. **Circumventing Obstacles:** Instead of going straight up from (18.0, 14.0), the path now moves slightly left to (17.5, 14.0). 
2. **Clear Path:** From (17.5, 14.0), the path can safely move upwards to (17.5, 19.0) as it avoids both obstacles.
3. **Reaching Goal:** Finally, the path moves right to (18.0, 19.0) and then (19.0, 19.0), reaching the goal set without intersecting any obstacles.
