# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[17.2, 19.9], [15.3, 17.6], [16.4, 16.4], [18.8, 15.5]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 7.1), (9.0, 20.05)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:25:20 PM] The current path collides with Obstacle 3. We should adjust the path to go around this obstacle. One option is to route the path below Obstacle 3. Let's try this approach:

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),        # Start within the start set
    (1.0, 10.0),       # Continue from the valid subpath 
    (1.0, 15.0),       # Continue moving down, staying clear of Obstacle 3 
    (9.0, 15.0),       # Move right, passing below Obstacle 3
    (9.0, 20.05),      # Go through the breakpoint
    (15.0, 17.0),      # Continue towards the goal 
    (19.0, 19.0)       # End within the goal set
]
```

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Identify the Collision:** The feedback indicates a collision with Obstacle 3 in the second segment of the original path.
2. **Choose a Direction to Avoid:** Since the collision occurs when moving upwards, let's try going around Obstacle 3 from below. 
3. **Route Around the Obstacle:**  
    - We maintain the first two waypoints from the valid subpath.
    - We add waypoints to guide the path below Obstacle 3, ensuring enough clearance to avoid a collision.
4. **Connect to Breakpoint and Goal:**
    - Once clear of Obstacle 3, we route the path back up to the breakpoint (9.0, 20.05).
    - Finally, we connect to the original path segments to reach the goal. 

This adjusted path avoids Obstacle 3 by navigating below it while still passing through the required breakpoint and reaching the goal.

    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:25:31 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid obstacles 2 and 3. It can be routed to the right of obstacles 2 and 3, utilizing the breakpoint (9.0, 7.1) from set 1. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (10.0, 1.0),  # Continue moving right
    (10.0, 7.1),  # Move upwards to the breakpoint (9.0, 7.1), staying clear of obstacles 
    (15.0, 7.1),  # Move right, maintaining distance from obstacle 2
    (15.0, 17.0), # Move upwards, staying clear of obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move to the goal within the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Initial Segment:** The initial segments moving to the right are kept the same.
2. **Reaching Breakpoint:** Instead of moving up directly, the path now moves right to (10.0, 1.0), then upwards to reach the breakpoint (9.0, 7.1).
3. **Navigating to Goal:** From the breakpoint, the path moves further right to (15.0, 7.1), maintaining a safe distance from obstacles 2 and 3. Then, it moves upwards to (15.0, 17.0) and finally towards the goal. 

This adjusted path ensures a safe passage around the obstacles while passing through the required breakpoint and reaching the goal.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[17.2, 19.9], [15.3, 17.6], [16.4, 16.4], [18.8, 15.5]]
			Obstacle 2: [[11.3, 16.7], [8.1, 17.4], [9.0, 16.4], [11.0, 16.3]]
			Obstacle 3: [[0.2, 19.8], [4.5, 15.5], [9.7, 16.3], [9.0, 18.1]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 7.1), (9.0, 20.05)]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.0, 1.0), (10.0, 1.0), (10.0, 7.1), (9.0, 7.1), (15.0, 7.1), (15.0, 17.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 6 between points (15.0, 17.0) and (19.0, 19.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 1: [[17.2, 19.9], [15.3, 17.6], [16.4, 16.4], [18.8, 15.5]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(1.0, 1.0), (10.0, 1.0), (10.0, 7.1), (9.0, 7.1), (15.0, 7.1), (15.0, 17.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

[08/21/2024 04:25:57 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 1. The proposed path attempts to navigate above Obstacle 1 but fails to clear it. 

To circumvent Obstacle 1, we can route the path below it. 

Here is a revised path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   // Start within the start set
    (10.0, 1.0),  // Continue moving right
    (10.0, 7.1),  // Move upwards to the breakpoint
    (9.0, 7.1),   // Reach the breakpoint
    (15.0, 7.1),  // Move right, staying below Obstacle 1 and 2
    (15.0, 15.0), // Move downwards, staying to the left of Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 15.0), // Move right, staying below Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 19.0)  // Finally, move up into the goal set 
]
```

This revised path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles while successfully navigating through the breakpoints and reaching the goal set.
