# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[10.3, 15.5], [15.0, 10.5], [19.1, 15.1], [15.1, 16.2]]
			Obstacle 2: [[4.0, 18.1], [10.2, 16.6], [13.3, 18.7], [12.7, 19.7]]
			Obstacle 3: [[14.3, 14.9], [6.2, 6.6], [8.9, 5.2], [9.7, 5.1]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 1.59), (9.0, 13.18), (9.0, 20.51)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

### Provided Data

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:33:00 PM] The current path collides with Obstacle 1 because it attempts to move directly from the breakpoint to the goal set. To avoid this, we need to navigate around Obstacle 1. 

We can achieve this by leveraging the space above Obstacle 1. 

Here is a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 13.18),  # Pass through the breakpoint
    (11.0, 13.5),  #  A slight nudge to the right
    (11.0, 17.0),  # Move upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 1 
    (16.0, 17.0),  # Move right, maintaining clearance from Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Arrive at the goal set
]
```

This path first moves upwards before navigating to the right, effectively circumventing Obstacle 1 while adhering to all other requirements.

[08/21/2024 04:33:13 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid Obstacle 1. Since the problematic segment starts from the breakpoint (9.0, 13.18), we need to find a new path from this breakpoint. 

Instead of going east directly towards the goal, we can try going east-south-east. This direction allows us to navigate below Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2 while aiming towards the goal set.

    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:33:17 PM] The current path fails because it tries to cut through Obstacle 3. It makes sense to try to go around obstacle 3. Since the second waypoint (9.0, 13.18) is already above obstacle 3, we can try going even further up and then navigate towards the goal from there.

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, 13.18), 
    (9.0, 17.0), # Go further up 
    (16.0, 17.0), # Move rightwards above all obstacles 
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Reach the goal

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[08/21/2024 04:34:13 PM] The initial path choice was good, aiming for the breakpoint (9.0, 13.18) to navigate around the first obstacle. However, the direct path from there to (14.0, 13.18) cuts through both Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3. 

To circumvent this, we can adjust the path to navigate above Obstacle 1 and 3.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 13.18),    # Pass through the breakpoint, successfully avoiding Obstacle 2
    (9.0, 16.5),    # Move vertically upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 1
    (14.0, 16.5),   # Move horizontally, now above obstacles 1 and 3
    (16.0, 17.0),    # Continue towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)     # End within the goal set
] 
```

This path aims to:

1. **Maintain the successful initial segment:**  The path to the breakpoint (9.0, 13.18) is valid.
2. **Navigate above obstacles:** By moving vertically upwards to (9.0, 16.5), the path avoids intersecting Obstacle 1 or 3. 
3. **Proceed towards the goal:** From (14.0, 16.5), the path can safely continue towards the goal set without encountering further obstacles.
