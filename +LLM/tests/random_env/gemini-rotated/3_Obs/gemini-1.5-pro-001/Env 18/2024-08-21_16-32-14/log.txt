# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[17.8, 19.0], [15.7, 17.9], [17.5, 15.7], [18.1, 16.4]]
			Obstacle 2: [[19.3, 6.1], [17.4, 11.1], [17.5, 7.2], [19.2, 5.4]]
			Obstacle 3: [[18.1, 16.2], [7.6, 18.4], [8.3, 16.1], [8.9, 15.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 6.5), (9.0, 20.05)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:32:24 PM] The current path collides with obstacles because it aims for the goal in a straight line from the breakpoint (14.0, 12.0). To avoid this, we need to navigate around obstacle 1 and 3.

Let's try approaching the goal from below:

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 6.5),   # Pass through the breakpoint 
    (14.0, 6.5),  # Move right, staying below obstacle 3
    (16.0, 6.5),   # Continue right, staying clear of obstacle 2
    (16.0, 17.0),  # Move upwards, staying left of obstacle 1
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Reach the goal within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Maintain Same Start & Breakpoint:** The first two waypoints remain the same.
2. **Move Right, Then Up:** Instead of directly aiming for the goal, the path moves further to the right, staying below obstacle 3 and clear of obstacle 2. 
3. **Safe Ascent:** Once clear of the obstacles, the path moves upward to reach the goal.

This new path avoids all obstacles while meeting the given requirements.

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:32:31 PM] The current path fails because it tries to cross obstacle 3 vertically.  We can avoid this by going around obstacle 3. Since we have to pass through (9.0, 6.5),  a viable path could go around obstacle 3 from the left.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 6.5),   # Pass through the breakpoint
    (9.0, 15.0),  # Move upwards, staying clear of obstacle 3
    (14.0, 15.0), # Move right, staying clear of obstacle 3
    (16.0, 15.0), # Continue moving right
    (16.0, 17.0), # Move upwards towards the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Arrive at a point within the goal set
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles:

* **Obstacle 1:**  The path stays entirely to the left of this obstacle.
* **Obstacle 2:**  The path stays to the left and above this obstacle.
* **Obstacle 3:** The path first moves upwards, staying clear to the left, then moves to the right above the obstacle.

Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:32:37 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 3. We can achieve this by going around the obstacle.

Looking at the valid subpath, we can continue from  `(16.0, 15.0)`. Instead of attempting to go straight up, which collides with Obstacle 3, we can navigate around it. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, 6.5), 
    (9.0, 15.0), 
    (14.0, 15.0), 
    (16.0, 15.0), # End of valid subpath
    (16.0, 14.0), # Move down to avoid Obstacle 3 
    (16.0, 12.0), # Continue moving down, further clearing Obstacle 3
    (19.0, 12.0), # Move right towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Move up to reach the goal set
]
```

This path first avoids the obstacle by moving down, ensuring a safe distance from Obstacle 3, then proceeds rightward, and finally upwards to reach the goal.
