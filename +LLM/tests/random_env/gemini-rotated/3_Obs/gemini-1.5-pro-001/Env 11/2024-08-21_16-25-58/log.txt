# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[17.1, 19.3], [15.0, 17.5], [16.1, 16.6], [18.4, 15.4]]
			Obstacle 2: [[15.1, 17.0], [8.1, 16.5], [17.3, 10.5], [18.7, 10.3]]
			Obstacle 3: [[16.7, 19.4], [16.1, 18.0], [16.9, 17.5], [18.0, 16.9]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 6.96), (9.0, 19.28)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:26:02 PM] A viable path can be visualized by moving upwards from the start set, navigating around obstacle 2, and finally reaching the goal set.

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start set
    (1.0, 6.0),  # Move upwards, staying clear of obstacle 2
    (9.0, 6.96),  # Pass through the breakpoint of Set 1
    (12.0, 8.0),  # Navigate around obstacle 2 
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:26:06 PM] The provided path crosses obstacles because it goes directly towards the goal, cutting through the space occupied by obstacles 1 and 2. 

The valid subpath suggests that going around the obstacles from the left side might be a viable option.

Therefore, a possible solution is to continue from the last valid waypoint, navigate around the obstacles by passing below them, and then proceed to the goal.

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (1.0, 6.0), 
    (9.0, 6.96), 
    (12.0, 8.0), 
    (14.0, 7.0),  # Go around obstacles by passing below
    (16.0, 6.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Head to the goal
]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:26:12 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid crossing obstacles 1 and 2. Currently, the path attempts to move directly from (16.0, 6.0) to (19.0, 19.0), which cuts through both obstacles. 

Instead, we can leverage the provided breakpoint at (9.0, 19.28) to navigate around the obstacles.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (1.0, 6.0), 
    (9.0, 6.96), 
    (9.0, 19.28),  # Utilize the breakpoint to move above obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Now we can safely reach the goal
]
```

This path first follows the valid subpath, then goes upwards to the breakpoint to bypass the obstacles completely. From there, it's a clear shot to the goal position.

Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:26:17 PM] The current path collides with Obstacle 2 because it attempts to go straight up from a breakpoint within the obstacle's x-range. To circumvent this, we need to navigate around Obstacle 2. 

We can achieve this by leveraging the valid subpath provided:  [(1.0, 1.0), (1.0, 6.0), (9.0, 6.96)]. 

Instead of moving straight up to the second breakpoint, we can move rightwards, staying below Obstacle 2, and then upwards, aiming for the goal:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (1.0, 6.0), 
    (9.0, 6.96), 
    (14.0, 6.96), # move right, staying below Obstacle 2
    (14.0, 19.0), # move upwards, clear of Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)  # reach the goal 
] 

[08/21/2024 04:26:17 PM] Parsed response: [(1.0, 1.0), (1.0, 6.0), (9.0, 6.96), (14.0, 6.96), (14.0, 19.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[17.1, 19.3], [15.0, 17.5], [16.1, 16.6], [18.4, 15.4]]
			Obstacle 2: [[15.1, 17.0], [8.1, 16.5], [17.3, 10.5], [18.7, 10.3]]
			Obstacle 3: [[16.7, 19.4], [16.1, 18.0], [16.9, 17.5], [18.0, 16.9]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 6.96), (9.0, 19.28)]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.0, 1.0), (1.0, 6.0), (9.0, 6.96), (14.0, 6.96), (14.0, 19.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 4 between points (14.0, 6.96) and (14.0, 19.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 2: [[15.1, 17.0], [8.1, 16.5], [17.3, 10.5], [18.7, 10.3]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(1.0, 1.0), (1.0, 6.0), (9.0, 6.96), (14.0, 6.96)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:26:23 PM] The provided path goes too far to the right before moving upwards, leading to a collision with Obstacle 2. Instead, we should leverage the breakpoint (9.0, 6.96) and navigate above Obstacle 2.

Here's a revised path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start set
    (1.0, 6.0),  # Move upwards
    (9.0, 6.96), # Reach Breakpoint Set 1 
    (9.0, 12.0), # Move upwards to avoid Obstacle 2 
    (14.0, 12.0), # Move rightwards above Obstacle 2
    (14.0, 19.0), # Move upwards 
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Reach the goal set
]
```

This path first moves upwards to bypass the lower obstacles. Then, it utilizes the breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1 to navigate around the left side of Obstacle 2. Finally, it proceeds right and upwards to reach the goal set.
