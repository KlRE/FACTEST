# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.9, 16.0], [18.1, 15.3], [19.2, 17.6], [17.6, 17.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[15.7, 15.5], [16.5, 7.0], [19.0, 16.8], [18.2, 16.7]]
			Obstacle 3: [[6.0, 13.8], [1.1, 10.5], [9.8, 1.4], [14.2, 3.9]]
			Obstacle 4: [[7.3, 17.0], [10.5, 10.6], [17.0, 7.3], [10.3, 16.6]]
			Obstacle 5: [[2.6, 10.7], [13.7, 13.3], [14.8, 16.7], [5.9, 13.7]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 0.12), (9.0, 11.18), (9.0, 19.38)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:55:05 PM] Here is a possible path considering the provided data:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 0.12),   # Pass through Breakpoint Set 1
    (10.0, 7.0),   # Navigate around Obstacle 3, maintaining a safe distance
    (17.0, 10.0),  # Continue towards the goal, avoiding Obstacles 2 and 4
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

* The path starts at (1.0, 1.0), which is inside the start set.
* It then moves to (9.0, 0.12), the first breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1.
* From there, it navigates carefully around Obstacle 3 by passing through (10.0, 7.0), staying clear of its boundaries.
* The path continues towards the goal, strategically passing through (17.0, 10.0) to avoid both Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 4. 
* Finally, it reaches the goal set at (19.0, 19.0).

**Important:**  This path is a visual estimation based on the provided coordinates. It's crucial to verify its validity and safety through calculations and potentially with visualization tools to ensure no collisions occur with the obstacles.

[08/21/2024 04:55:12 PM] The current path collides with Obstacle 3 because the straight line segment connecting (9.0, 0.12) and (10.0, 7.0) cuts through it.  We need to find a way around Obstacle 3 to reach the goal. 

One option is to route the path above Obstacle 3. We can do this by adding a waypoint at (9.0, 11.18), which is a breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1 and is located above Obstacle 3. From there, we can continue to the goal area.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), # starting point 
    (9.0, 0.12), # breakpoint
    (9.0, 11.18), # breakpoint above Obstacle 3
    (17.0, 11.18), # Move right, staying above Obstacle 3 and 4
    (19.0, 19.0) # Goal point
]
```

This new path avoids colliding with Obstacle 3 by routing above it and maintains a clear path to the goal.

[08/21/2024 04:55:19 PM] The current path collides with obstacle 3 because it attempts to move directly upwards from the breakpoint (9.0, 0.12). To avoid this, we need to route the path around obstacle 3. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start point
    (9.0, 0.12),  # Breakpoint 1
    (15.0, 0.12), # Move right, staying below Obstacle 3
    (15.0, 11.18),# Move upwards, clear of Obstacle 3
    (17.0, 11.18),# Continue to the original path
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Stay Low:** Instead of moving directly upwards, the new path first moves rightwards along the lower edge of obstacle 3 by adding the waypoint (15.0, 0.12). 
2. **Move Up:** Once clear of obstacle 3, the path moves upwards to rejoin the original path at waypoint (15.0, 11.18).
3. **Continue as Planned:** From there, the path follows the original waypoints to reach the goal. 

This adjustment ensures the path avoids obstacle 3 while still passing through the required breakpoints and reaching the goal.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:55:27 PM] The feedback correctly identifies that the path segment between (15.0, 0.12) and (15.0, 11.18) crosses Obstacle 4. To rectify this, we need to reroute the path to go around this obstacle.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 0.12),  # Pass through the first breakpoint
    (15.0, 0.12), # Point before the problematic segment 
    (15.0, 6.0),  # Move upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 4
    (17.0, 6.0),  # Move rightwards, clear of Obstacle 4
    (17.0, 11.18), # Approach the second breakpoint from a safe direction
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End within the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Staying Low:** Instead of going directly upwards, the new path stays below Obstacle 4 by moving to (15.0, 6.0).
2. **Going Around:** From there, it moves rightwards to (17.0, 6.0), safely clearing Obstacle 4.
3. **Approaching the Breakpoint:** The path then proceeds upwards to (17.0, 11.18), approaching the second breakpoint from a direction that avoids Obstacle 4. 

This new path avoids crossing any obstacles while still satisfying the requirement of passing through the breakpoints and reaching the goal set.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:55:33 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid obstacles 2 and 4. Instead of going up to (17.0, 11.18) and potentially hitting the obstacles, we can try going around obstacle 2 from the right side. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start in the start set
    (9.0, 0.12),  # Pass through the first breakpoint
    (15.0, 0.12), 
    (15.0, 6.0),
    (17.0, 6.0), # This is where the initial path was invalid
    (19.0, 6.0), # Move further right, keeping a distance from obstacle 2
    (19.0, 17.0), # Move upwards, staying clear of obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End in the goal set
]
```

This path maintains a safe distance from the obstacles while still passing through the required breakpoints and staying within the defined start and goal sets.
