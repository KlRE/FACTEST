# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[13.5, 19.5], [11.6, 17.4], [12.2, 17.0], [14.2, 17.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[15.7, 15.4], [19.8, 10.5], [19.3, 12.9], [17.9, 16.5]]
			Obstacle 3: [[10.7, 18.1], [16.1, 15.8], [19.6, 17.6], [11.7, 19.4]]
			Obstacle 4: [[6.5, 18.1], [8.5, 18.2], [10.3, 18.9], [8.5, 18.6]]
			Obstacle 5: [[11.6, 17.0], [17.6, 11.1], [19.4, 15.1], [15.1, 18.1]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 8.2), (9.0, 20.34)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:53:10 PM] Here's a possible path considering the provided data:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 8.2),    # Pass through Breakpoint Set 1
    (10.0, 10.0),   # Navigate around Obstacle 2 and 5
    (17.0, 17.0),   # Approach the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End within the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation:**

* **(1.0, 1.0):**  Starts safely within the start set.
* **(9.0, 8.2):** This waypoint takes the path directly through the first breakpoint, satisfying that requirement.
* **(10.0, 10.0):** This waypoint begins to steer the path around the cluster of Obstacles 2, 3, and 5.
* **(17.0, 17.0):** Now clear of the obstacles, the path heads towards the goal set.
* **(19.0, 19.0):**  The path ends safely within the goal set.

**Important:** This is a visual interpretation and may not be perfectly optimized. It's crucial to plot these points and the obstacles to visually verify that no collisions occur.

]

[08/21/2024 04:53:18 PM] The suggested path goes through obstacles 3 and 5. It needs to be adjusted to avoid these obstacles. 

Looking at the map, we can identify a path around the obstacles by going below them. This path utilizes the provided breakpoint (9.0, 8.2) and goes around the obstacles to the right, then upwards to the goal:

1. **Start:** (1.0, 1.0) - Starting within the start set.
2. **Breakpoint:** (9.0, 8.2) - Using the provided breakpoint.
3. **Below Obstacles:** (12.0, 7.0) - This waypoint takes the path below obstacle 5, maintaining a safe distance.
4. **Clear Path:** (16.0, 7.0) - This waypoint moves further to the right, ensuring a clear path to move upwards.
5. **Towards Goal:** (16.0, 17.0) -  Safely navigating around the obstacles, this waypoint takes the path upwards towards the goal.
6. **End:** (19.0, 19.0) - Reaching the goal set.

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 8.2), (12.0, 7.0), (16.0, 7.0), (16.0, 17.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[08/21/2024 04:53:26 PM] The current path gets stuck at (16.0, 7.0) as moving upwards with a straight line immediately collides with Obstacles 2, 3, and 5.

Let's adjust the path to navigate around these obstacles:

1. **Utilize the valid subpath:** We'll keep the valid portion of the path: [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 8.2), (12.0, 7.0)].

2. **Navigate around obstacles:** Instead of going straight up from (12.0, 7.0), let's go around Obstacle 2:
    -  Move to the right, giving enough clearance to Obstacle 2: (17.0, 7.0).
    -  Then, move upwards towards the goal, carefully maneuvering between Obstacles 2 and 3: (17.0, 16.0).

3. **Reach the goal:** Finally, move horizontally to the left to enter the goal set: (19.0, 16.0). 

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 8.2), (12.0, 7.0), (17.0, 7.0), (17.0, 16.0), (19.0, 16.0)]

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Goal Position: End within the specified rectangular goal set.
Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:53:31 PM] The previous path went too far in the y-direction before heading towards the goal. Let's try going around the obstacles in a clockwise manner.

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # start in the start set
    (9.0, 8.2),  # go to the breakpoint
    (12.0, 7.0), # continue moving right and slightly down
    (17.0, 7.0), # move further right, staying below the obstacles
    (17.0, 10.0), # carefully move upwards, staying to the left of Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 10.0), # move right towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0), # move up to the level of the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0) # move right into the goal set

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
