# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[16.6, 14.6], [15.0, 9.4], [15.3, 3.0], [16.0, 5.2]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, -0.15), (9.0, 14.79), (9.0, 20.25)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 05:06:17 PM] The first segment of the proposed path crosses two obstacles. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around these obstacles. 

Observing the layout, we can first try to reach the required breakpoint by going above obstacle 5 and 2. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.5),  # Start inside the start set
    (1.0, 13.0),  # Move upwards, staying clear above obstacle 5
    (9.0, 14.79), # Reach the breakpoint of the first breakpoint set
    (13.0, 15.5), # Continue with the original path as it was valid
    (17.0, 16.5),
    (17.5, 19.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End inside the goal set

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 05:06:24 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 4.  We can achieve this by routing the path around the bottom of the obstacle. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.5),   # start in the start set
    (1.0, 13.0),  # move upwards 
    (9.0, 14.79), # continue to the breakpoint 
    (13.0, 14.0), # move rightwards, staying below Obstacle 4
    (17.0, 14.0), # continue rightwards, still below Obstacle 4
    (17.5, 19.0), # move upwards to avoid Obstacle 4's corner
    (19.0, 19.0)  # move rightwards to the goal set
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Maintain previous valid segments:**  The path segment from the start to the breakpoint remains valid.
2. **Navigate below Obstacle 4:** Instead of attempting to go above Obstacle 4, the path now goes downwards after the breakpoint. 
3. **Maintain clearance:** The path stays at a safe distance from the obstacle's bottom edge to avoid any collisions. 
4. **Rejoin original path:** After clearing Obstacle 4, the path rejoins the original trajectory to reach the goal set.

        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 05:06:29 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid Obstacle 1. Since the valid subpath ends quite close to the obstacle, we will try to find a way around it.

Moving further up seems impossible due to Obstacle 3. We can try going underneath Obstacle 1.

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.5), 
    (1.0, 13.0), 
    (9.0, 14.79), 
    (13.0, 14.0), 
    (13.0, 5.0), # move down, staying clear of Obstacle 1
    (17.0, 5.0), # move right, staying clear of Obstacle 1

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.

[08/21/2024 05:07:01 PM] The current path collides with Obstacle 2 because it tries to move directly downwards while the obstacle is in the way. To avoid this, we can navigate around Obstacle 2 by first moving to the right, then downwards, and finally back to the left.

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 05:07:07 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 1. Instead of going straight down from (15.5, 14.0), we can route the path around the obstacle. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.5), 
    (1.0, 13.0), 
    (9.0, 14.79), 
    (13.0, 14.0),
    (14.0, 14.0),  # Move slightly right to avoid Obstacle 1
    (14.0, 4.0),  # Move down, clear of Obstacle 1
    (17.0, 4.0),  # Move right
    (17.5, 19.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This path maintains the valid portion and adds a detour around Obstacle 1 by first moving right and then downwards.
