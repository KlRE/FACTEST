# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[13.4, 18.9], [5.6, 19.2], [6.7, 13.9], [9.3, 13.3]]
			Obstacle 2: [[13.8, 17.2], [15.1, 15.3], [16.1, 19.2], [15.4, 19.0]]

			Obstacle 4: [[5.4, 18.0], [7.6, 15.1], [12.7, 19.4], [7.3, 18.6]]
			Obstacle 5: [[10.4, 15.4], [15.0, 16.6], [15.3, 18.5], [11.4, 17.2]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 5.68), (9.0, 20.53)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:56:05 PM] Here is a possible path considering the provided data:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 5.68),   # Pass through Breakpoint Set 1 
    (9.0, 12.0),  # Navigate around obstacles, maintaining a safe distance
    (17.0, 12.0),  # Continue moving towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

* The path starts at (1.0, 1.0) which is inside the start set.
* It then goes through the first breakpoint (9.0, 5.68).
* From there, it moves directly upwards to (9.0, 12.0), safely navigating around the cluster of obstacles. 
* It then proceeds horizontally to the right, reaching (17.0, 12.0).
* Finally, it moves to (19.0, 19.0), ending within the goal set.

**Important:** This path is a visual estimation based on the provided coordinates. It's crucial to **verify** this path with appropriate tools or simulations to guarantee it maintains a safe distance from all obstacles and meets the specific requirements of your motion planning task.

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:56:15 PM] The current path gets stuck at the breakpoint (9.0, 5.68) due to the positions of obstacles 1 and 4. We need to find a way around these obstacles to reach the goal. 

Looking at the layout, we can try going above both obstacles. Since the path needs to pass through (9.0, 5.68), we can add a waypoint to the right to avoid obstacle 1, then go up, and finally proceed towards the goal.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start point
    (9.0, 5.68),    # Breakpoint 
    (11.0, 5.68),   # Move right to avoid obstacle 1
    (11.0, 20.0),  # Move up, clearing obstacles 1 and 4
    (19.0, 20.0)   # Move right to the goal region
] 
``` 

This path avoids all obstacles by going around the right side of obstacles 1 and 4, ensuring a safe passage to the goal.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:56:23 PM] The path needs to navigate around obstacles 1, 3, 4, and 5 to reach the goal. The provided valid subpath takes us to a good starting point.

1. **Valid Subpath Analysis:** The subpath [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 5.68), (11.0, 5.68)] successfully navigates to the right of obstacles 1 and 4 and below obstacle 3.

2. **Navigating Obstacles:**  We need to move upwards, avoiding obstacle 5. Since the top-right corner of obstacle 5 is at (15.0, 18.5), we should aim to be to its right.

3. **Reaching the Goal:** Once we've cleared obstacle 5, we can move towards the goal set.

**New Path:**
```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, 5.68), 
    (11.0, 5.68), 
    (11.0, 19.0),  # Move upwards, staying clear of obstacle 5
    (16.0, 19.0),  # Move right, staying clear of obstacle 5
    (19.0, 20.0)   # Reach the goal set

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:56:31 PM] The current path fails because it tries to directly move upwards through a bottleneck formed by obstacles 1, 3, 4, and 5. We need to navigate around these obstacles.

Let's utilize the valid subpath provided: [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 5.68), (11.0, 5.68)]. 

Instead of moving upwards at x = 11.0, we can try to move rightwards above Obstacle 3. To do this safely, we need to be above the y-coordinate of Obstacle 3's highest point (y = 15.8). 

From (11.0, 5.68), we can move to (17.0, 5.68), safely passing below Obstacle 1. Then, we can move upwards to (17.0, 16.5), staying clear above Obstacle 3. 

Finally, we can move rightwards to reach the goal set: (19.0, 16.5), (19.0, 19.0).

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, 5.68), 
    (11.0, 5.68), 
    (17.0, 5.68), 
    (17.0, 16.5), 
    (19.0, 16.5), 
    (19.0, 19.0)
