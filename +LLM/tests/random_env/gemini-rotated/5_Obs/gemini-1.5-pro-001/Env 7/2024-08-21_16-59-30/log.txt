# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[20.0, 7.8], [6.6, 15.3], [8.9, 8.8], [10.0, 6.9]]
			Obstacle 2: [[15.5, 5.8], [17.8, 7.7], [19.8, 17.4], [18.9, 17.3]]
			Obstacle 3: [[3.5, 10.6], [11.6, 17.5], [12.0, 19.3], [9.0, 18.1]]
			Obstacle 4: [[14.0, 12.8], [13.1, 7.6], [14.3, 5.8], [16.9, 9.0]]
			Obstacle 5: [[8.4, 19.4], [8.0, 18.6], [9.7, 16.5], [17.2, 16.2]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 3.31), (9.0, 14.61), (9.0, 20.59)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/21/2024 04:59:52 PM] It looks like the breakpoint set is missing from the example.  However, I can provide a path that fits the rest of the criteria and give some ideas about how to incorporate breakpoints.

Here's a visually-imagined path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start inside the start set
    (9.0, 4.0),    # Navigate towards Breakpoint Set 1 while avoiding Obstacle 4
    (9.0, 14.61),  # Pass through a breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1 
    (12.0, 16.0),  # Move further right to avoid Obstacle 3
    (17.0, 17.0),  # Position to head towards the goal 
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End inside the goal set
]
```

**Explanation and Breakpoint Integration**

* **Start:** We begin within the start quadrilateral.
* **Avoiding Obstacles:** The path is carefully designed to maneuver around the obstacles.  The most critical areas are between Obstacles 3 and 4 and then angling towards the goal to avoid Obstacles 2 and 5. 
* **Breakpoints:** The provided path directly passes through the second breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1 (9.0, 14.61). If you need to use a different breakpoint, you would adjust the path in the vicinity of (9.0, 14.61) to guide it through your chosen breakpoint.
* **Goal:**  The path concludes within the goal quadrilateral.

**Important Considerations**

* **Visualization:** It is strongly recommended to sketch the start, goal, obstacles, and breakpoints on a coordinate plane to help visualize the path.
* **Precision:** This solution provides a general trajectory. You might need to make minor adjustments to the waypoint coordinates to ensure a safe distance from the obstacles depending on how strictly you define "touching."

Let me know if you have any adjustments to the problem or would like to explore alternative paths!

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 4.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:59:59 PM] The current path fails because the segment between (9.0, 4.0) and (9.0, 14.61) crosses obstacle 1. 

Looking at the map, we can navigate around obstacle 1 by moving right before reaching it. We can also adjust the path to go around obstacle 1 from the left side. Let's try the latter approach.  

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start point
    (9.0, 4.0),   # Keep this waypoint as it's still valid
    (6.0, 7.0),   # Move left and slightly up to avoid obstacle 1
    (6.0, 16.0),  # Move further up, clearing obstacle 1
    (9.0, 14.61), # Connect to the breakpoint
    (12.0, 16.0), # The rest of the path remains valid
    (17.0, 17.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End point
]
```

This path carefully maneuvers around obstacle 1 while still utilizing the chosen breakpoint. Be sure to visually verify this path against the obstacle coordinates to confirm it maintains a safe distance.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 05:00:12 PM] The path needs adjustments to avoid colliding with Obstacle 3. Currently, the segment between (7.0, 7.0) and (6.0, 16.0) cuts through this obstacle.  

Let's reroute the path after the valid subpath [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 4.0), (7.0, 7.0)]. 

Instead of going directly towards (6.0, 16.0), we can navigate around the right side of Obstacle 3:

* From (7.0, 7.0),  move further right towards a point like (13.0, 7.0) to clear Obstacle 3. 
* Then, proceed upwards to a point like (13.0, 16.0) to align with the original path's direction.
* Now, we can safely move left towards (9.0, 14.61) to reach the breakpoint.

From there, the original path segments should be clear of obstacles.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, 4.0), 
    (7.0, 7.0), 
    (13.0, 7.0), # Go around Obstacle 3 
    (13.0, 16.0), # Align with the target direction
    (9.0, 14.61), # Reach the breakpoint
    (12.0, 16.0), 
    (17.0, 17.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 05:00:21 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 1. Since we already have a valid subpath ending at (7.0, 7.0), let's try to continue from there.

To avoid Obstacle 1, the path needs to move upwards before moving right towards the goal area.  We can achieve this by adding waypoints above Obstacle 1 and then navigating towards the goal.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, 4.0), 
    (7.0, 7.0), 
    (7.0, 16.0), # Move upwards above Obstacle 1
    (12.0, 16.0), # Move right towards the goal
    (9.0, 14.61), 
    (12.0, 16.0), 
    (17.0, 17.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This path:

1. **Starts** inside the start set at (1.0, 1.0).
2. **Navigates** to (7.0, 7.0), the end of the valid subpath.
3. **Moves upwards** to (7.0, 16.0) to bypass Obstacle 1.
4. **Continues** towards the goal area.
5. **Passes through** the breakpoint (9.0, 14.61).
6. **Finally**, ends inside the goal set at (19.0, 19.0).
