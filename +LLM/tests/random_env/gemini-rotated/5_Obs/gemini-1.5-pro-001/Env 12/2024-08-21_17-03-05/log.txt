# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[0.6, 10.5], [8.1, 7.2], [13.4, 18.8], [0.8, 17.3]]
			Obstacle 2: [[18.5, 15.1], [15.6, 13.0], [17.0, 5.0], [18.4, 11.3]]
			Obstacle 3: [[19.9, 16.0], [10.1, 20.0], [12.8, 18.3], [18.9, 15.6]]
			Obstacle 4: [[14.4, 13.4], [7.7, 19.0], [8.2, 13.1], [11.0, 12.5]]
			Obstacle 5: [[15.1, 14.5], [15.2, 13.3], [18.1, 10.6], [16.7, 14.4]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 3.58), (9.0, 20.13)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 05:03:13 PM] It looks like there's no trivial straight path from start to goal. A path needs to maneuver around obstacles, especially obstacles 1 and 4, to reach the goal. Here's a potential path considering the obstacles and breakpoints: 

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 3.58),     # Breakpoint from set 1
    (9.5, 8.0),      # Maneuver around obstacle 1
    (14.0, 19.0),    # Navigate around obstacle 4 
    (19.0, 19.0)     # End within the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(1.0, 1.0):** Starting inside the start quadrilateral. 
2. **(9.0, 3.58):**  This is a breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1.
3. **(9.5, 8.0):**  This point allows the path to move upward, clearing obstacle 1. 
4. **(14.0, 19.0):** The path goes around the top of obstacle 4.
5. **(19.0, 19.0):** Finally, the path reaches a point safely within the goal quadrilateral.

**Important:** This is a visual estimation. It's crucial to plot these points and the obstacles on a graph to visually verify that the path segments don't intersect with any obstacles and maintain a safe distance.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 05:03:19 PM] The provided path collides with obstacles 3 and 4 after passing through the first breakpoint. 

To circumvent these obstacles, we can adjust the path by leveraging the space beneath obstacle 4. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start point within the start set
    (9.0, 3.58),  # First breakpoint 
    (9.5, 8.0),  # Point before collision, kept for context
    (9.5, 6.0),  # Navigate downwards, staying clear of obstacle 4
    (16.0, 6.0), # Move rightwards, remaining beneath obstacle 4
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Move upwards to the goal point within the goal set 
]
```

This adjusted path avoids the collisions by:

1. **Maintaining a safe distance from obstacle 4:** Instead of moving directly towards the goal, the path first dips downwards to go around the lower end of obstacle 4.

2. **Utilizing the open space:** The path then moves rightwards, taking advantage of the open space below obstacle 4.

3. **Finally ascending to the goal:** Once clear of the obstacles, the path moves upwards to reach the goal point.

[08/21/2024 05:03:25 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with obstacles 2, 3, and 5. Observing the map, we can navigate around these obstacles by making the following changes:

1.  From the last valid waypoint (16.0, 6.0), move further right to (17.5, 6.0) to avoid obstacle 5.
2.  Next, move upwards to (17.5, 14.0) staying clear of obstacle 2.
3.  Finally, proceed right to reach the goal set at (19.0, 14.0).

Here's the adjusted path:

[08/21/2024 05:04:05 PM] The issue is that the path attempts to cross between obstacles 2 and 5, leading to a collision. Additionally, it needs to be extended to reach the goal set. 

To address this, we can leverage the valid subpath provided:  [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 3.58), (9.5, 8.0), (9.5, 6.0), (16.0, 6.0)].

1. **Continuing from the valid subpath:** From (16.0, 6.0), we need to navigate around Obstacle 2 to reach the goal set. 

2. **Maneuvering around Obstacle 2:**  We can achieve this by moving vertically upward, clearing Obstacle 2, and then proceeding horizontally towards the goal set.

3. **Reaching the Goal Set:** Finally, we'll guide the path to a point within the goal set.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, 3.58), 
    (9.5, 8.0), 
    (9.5, 6.0), 
    (16.0, 6.0), 
    (16.0, 16.0),  # Move upward, clearing Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 16.0),  # Move right towards the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Final adjustment to end within the goal set

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 05:04:13 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacles 2 and 5. 

Currently, the path attempts to move directly upwards from (16.0, 6.0) to (16.0, 16.0).  We can navigate around these obstacles by going east before heading north.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start point
    (9.0, 3.58),  # Breakpoint 1 
    (9.5, 8.0),   
    (9.5, 6.0),   
    (16.0, 6.0),  
    (17.5, 6.0),  # Move east, staying clear of Obstacle 5 
    (17.5, 16.0), # Move north, clear of Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 16.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point within the goal set
]
```

This path avoids the obstacles while still satisfying the given constraints:

* **Start and End:** The path starts within the start set and ends within the goal set.
* **Breakpoints:** The path passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 3.58) from Breakpoint Set 1.
* **Non-Crossing:**  The adjusted path avoids crossing any obstacles.
