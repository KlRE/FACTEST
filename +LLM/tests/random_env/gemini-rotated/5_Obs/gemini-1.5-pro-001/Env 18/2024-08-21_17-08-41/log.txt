# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[18.9, 14.1], [18.4, 6.0], [19.3, 8.5], [19.9, 10.6]]
			Obstacle 2: [[15.1, 14.1], [18.6, 16.8], [16.7, 16.7], [16.1, 15.9]]
			Obstacle 3: [[15.3, 8.8], [16.7, 1.6], [18.1, 10.4], [17.6, 11.1]]
			Obstacle 4: [[8.8, 18.5], [1.1, 15.1], [6.6, 10.2], [13.1, 13.3]]
			Obstacle 5: [[10.3, 17.4], [17.1, 8.2], [17.9, 8.9], [16.2, 14.7]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 4.67), (9.0, 20.12)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 05:08:48 PM] Here is a possible path considering the provided data:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 4.67),   # Pass through the first breakpoint
    (10.0, 8.0),   # Navigate around obstacle 4
    (17.0, 12.0),  # Navigate between obstacles 2 and 5
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(2.0, 1.0):** Starts within the start quadrilateral.
2. **(9.0, 4.67):**  Directly targets the first breakpoint from breakpoint set 1. 
3. **(10.0, 8.0):**  Moves further upwards and slightly to the right, safely clearing obstacle 4.
4. **(17.0, 12.0):** Carefully navigates through the tight space between obstacles 2 and 5.
5. **(19.0, 19.0):**  Directly enters the goal quadrilateral.

**Important:** This path is just one possibility. There might be other equally valid paths. It's crucial to visually verify this path against the obstacle data to ensure it doesn't intersect with any of the obstacles.

[08/21/2024 05:08:59 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 5. We can achieve this by adding a waypoint that goes around the obstacle. 

Looking at the layout of the obstacles, the path can be adjusted to continue upwards from waypoint (10.0, 8.0) and then move right towards the goal set, going around Obstacle 5. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, 4.67), 
    (10.0, 8.0), 
    (10.0, 15.0), # move upwards to avoid Obstacle 5

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 05:09:05 PM] The provided path collides with Obstacle 4. To circumvent this, we can adjust the path to go around Obstacle 4. 

Instead of moving directly upwards from the breakpoint (9.0, 4.67), we can guide the path to the right, navigate around Obstacle 4, and then proceed upwards to reach the goal set. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, 4.67), 
    (14.0, 4.67), # move right
    (14.0, 16.0), # move upwards, clear of Obstacle 4
    (17.0, 17.0), # move towards goal
    (19.0, 19.0)  # end in the goal set
]
```

This new path avoids collision with Obstacle 4 by going around it. It maintains the starting and ending points within their respective sets and passes through the specified breakpoint.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 05:09:10 PM] The current path goes south of Obstacle 5 and gets stuck. To fix this, we need to find a way around Obstacle 5. 

One option is to route the path north of Obstacle 5. Here's how we can adjust the path:

1. **Continue from the last valid point:** (14.0, 4.67)
2. **Navigate above Obstacle 5:** (14.0, 15.0) 
3. **Proceed towards the goal:** (17.0, 17.0), (19.0, 19.0)

This results in the following path:

```
new_path = [(2.0, 1.0), (9.0, 4.67), (14.0, 4.67), (14.0, 15.0), (17.0, 17.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 05:09:15 PM] The feedback correctly identified that the path crosses obstacle 5. To fix this, we need to reroute the path to navigate around this obstacle. 

Instead of going straight up from the breakpoint (9.0, 4.67), we can move towards the right, staying below obstacle 5, and then going up to reach the goal. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, 4.67), 
    (13.0, 4.67), # move right, staying below obstacle 5
    (13.0, 15.0), # move upwards, clear of obstacle 5
    (17.0, 17.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This new path addresses the obstacle intersection and maintains the requirement of passing through the breakpoint.

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 05:09:22 PM] The issue is that the path tries to go up vertically from the breakpoint, which leads it to intersect with obstacles 4 and 5. 

To correct this, we can route the path to the right of obstacle 5 and then move upwards:

1. **Start from the valid subpath:** We can continue from the last valid point (13.0, 4.67).
2. **Navigate around obstacles:** Move further right to a point like (16.0, 4.67) to clearly bypass obstacle 5.
3. **Move upwards:** From there, we can safely move upwards to a point like (16.0, 17.0), avoiding obstacle 2.
4. **Reach the goal:** Finally, move towards the goal set, for example, to point (19.0, 19.0). 

Therefore, a corrected path would look like this:

```
new_path = [(2.0, 1.0), (9.0, 4.67), (13.0, 4.67), (16.0, 4.67), (16.0, 17.0), (19.0, 19.0)]
