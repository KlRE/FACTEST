# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[7.7, 13.5], [0.2, 3.8], [11.7, 3.4], [14.6, 10.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.2, 20.0], [5.8, 15.8], [10.1, 17.5], [4.1, 19.6]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 0.75), (9.0, 14.95), (9.0, 19.94)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:15:18 PM] Here's a possible path considering the obstacles and breakpoints:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start inside the start set
    (9.0, 0.75),     # Pass through Breakpoint Set 1
    (12.0, 1.0),    # Navigate around Obstacle 1
    (12.0, 19.0),   # Move upwards, avoiding Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End inside the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(1.0, 1.0):**  Begins within the start quadrilateral.
2. **(9.0, 0.75):**  Directly targets and passes through the first breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1.
3. **(12.0, 1.0):**  Moves to the right, safely clearing Obstacle 1.
4. **(12.0, 19.0):** Continues upwards, maintaining a safe distance from the right side of Obstacle 2.
5. **(19.0, 19.0):**  Moves horizontally to the left, reaching a point within the goal quadrilateral. 

**Important:** This path description assumes a direct, straight line between each waypoint.  Visualizing the obstacles and this path on a graph is highly recommended to verify that it avoids collisions.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:15:24 PM] The current path collides with obstacle 1 because it tries to go straight up from (12.0, 1.0). We need to navigate around this obstacle. 

We can do this by leveraging the breakpoint (9.0, 14.95) from Breakpoint Set 1.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 0.75),  # Pass through the first breakpoint, already part of the valid subpath
    (9.0, 14.95), # Move upwards to the second breakpoint of Breakpoint Set 1 to bypass Obstacle 1
    (12.0, 14.95), # Move rightwards, maintaining a safe distance from Obstacle 1
    (12.0, 19.0), # Move upwards to avoid Obstacle 2 
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move rightwards to reach the goal set
]
```

This path first moves to a breakpoint that allows it to safely navigate around Obstacle 1. Then, it maintains a safe distance from the obstacle and proceeds to the goal set, successfully avoiding both obstacles.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:15:32 PM] The path gets blocked by Obstacle 1. To circumvent it, we can leverage the second breakpoint of Breakpoint Set 1. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 14.95),  # Move to the second breakpoint, bypassing Obstacle 1
    (12.0, 14.95), # Move horizontally, maintaining a safe distance from Obstacle 1
    (12.0, 19.0),  # Move vertically upward, preparing to enter the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move horizontally into the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(1.0, 1.0) to (9.0, 14.95):**  This segment directly moves to the second breakpoint of Set 1, avoiding any intersection with Obstacle 1. 
2. **(9.0, 14.95) to (12.0, 14.95):**  This segment moves horizontally, keeping a safe distance from Obstacle 1.
3. **(12.0, 14.95) to (12.0, 19.0):** This segment moves vertically upward, readying for entry into the goal set.
4. **(12.0, 19.0) to (19.0, 19.0):** This final segment enters and navigates to a point within the goal set. 

This adjusted path successfully navigates the obstacles and reaches the goal set while adhering to the given constraints.

Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:15:38 PM] The path needs to navigate around Obstacle 1 to reach the breakpoint. Let's adjust the path to go below it.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 0.75),  # Go to the breakpoint below Obstacle 1
    (12.0, 0.75), # Move right, staying below Obstacle 1
    (12.0, 19.0), # Move upwards, clear of obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Reach the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(1.0, 1.0):** Starting point within the start set.
2. **(9.0, 0.75):** Move to the breakpoint that sits below Obstacle 1.
3. **(12.0, 0.75):**  Continue moving rightward, staying below Obstacle 1. 
4. **(12.0, 19.0):** Now clear of obstacles, move upwards towards the goal.
5. **(19.0, 19.0):**  Arrive at a point within the goal set.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[7.7, 13.5], [0.2, 3.8], [11.7, 3.4], [14.6, 10.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.2, 20.0], [5.8, 15.8], [10.1, 17.5], [4.1, 19.6]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 0.75), (9.0, 14.95), (9.0, 19.94)]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 0.75), (12.0, 0.75), (12.0, 19.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 3 between points (12.0, 0.75) and (12.0, 19.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 1: [[7.7, 13.5], [0.2, 3.8], [11.7, 3.4], [14.6, 10.0]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 0.75), (12.0, 0.75)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

[08/21/2024 04:15:57 PM] The suggested path hits an obstacle because it tries to go above obstacle 1 in a straight line. There are two possible solutions to this problem:

1. **Go below obstacle 1:** We can modify the path to go below obstacle 1. This approach keeps the path relatively simple.

    ```
    new_path = [
        (1.0, 1.0),  
        (9.0, 0.75),
        (12.0, 0.75),
        (12.0, 2.0), # Stay below obstacle 1
        (12.0, 19.0),
        (19.0, 19.0)
    ]
    ```

2. **Go through breakpoint 2:** Since going above in a straight line doesn't work, we can try utilizing another breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1. Breakpoint 2 (9.0, 14.95) seems promising as it lies above obstacle 1.

    ```
    new_path = [
        (1.0, 1.0),
        (9.0, 14.95), # Go through breakpoint 2
        (12.0, 14.95), # Move right, staying above obstacle 1
        (12.0, 19.0),
        (19.0, 19.0)
    ]
    ```

Both of these paths avoid the obstacle and reach the goal.  You can choose the one that best suits your specific needs.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:16:03 PM] The current path fails because it tries to cross Obstacle 1 vertically. We can adjust the path to go around this obstacle. Since the valid subpath ends very close to Obstacle 1, we need to be careful not to hit it when going around. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start point
    (9.0, 0.75),  # Breakpoint
    (12.0, 0.75), # Move right, staying below Obstacle 1
    (12.0, 2.0),  # Move slightly up
    (14.7, 2.0),  # Move right, clearing Obstacle 1's right edge
    (14.7, 19.0), # Move up, clearing all obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Goal point 
]
```

This path first moves right, staying below Obstacle 1.  Then, it carefully clears the obstacle by moving right and then up. This ensures it doesn't intersect with any part of Obstacle 1. Finally, it moves directly to the goal point.
