# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[17.2, 12.5], [19.2, 10.4], [19.5, 14.6], [18.2, 16.6]]
			Obstacle 2: [[10.8, 10.7], [10.7, 1.1], [16.8, 0.6], [17.4, 7.7]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 10.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:14:14 PM] The provided path goes through obstacle 2. We need to adjust the path to go around this obstacle. Since the breakpoint (9.0, 10.0) is very close to the obstacle, we need to find a path that curves around the obstacle.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 10.0), 
    (9.0, 6.0),   # Move down south, clearing Obstacle 2
    (13.0, 6.0),  # Move east, staying clear of Obstacle 2
    (13.0, 11.0), # Move north
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Proceed to the goal
]
```

This path first moves to the breakpoint as in the original path. Then, it moves south to circumvent obstacle 2 before heading east and north again to rejoin the original path. This avoids the intersection with the obstacle while still satisfying the problem constraints.

[08/21/2024 04:14:23 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 2. Since we must pass through the breakpoint (9.0, 10.0), we can navigate around Obstacle 2 by going below it. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),        # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 10.0),       # Pass through the breakpoint 
    (9.0, 4.0),        # Move down, staying clear below Obstacle 2
    (13.0, 4.0),       # Move right, staying below Obstacle 2 
    (13.0, 11.0),      # Move upward, clearing Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)       # Reach the goal within the goal set 
] 
```

Explanation:

1. **(1.0, 1.0) to (9.0, 10.0):**  This segment remains unchanged as it is valid.
2. **(9.0, 10.0) to (9.0, 4.0):** From the breakpoint, move directly south to a point safely below Obstacle 2. 
3. **(9.0, 4.0) to (13.0, 4.0):** Move eastward, staying below Obstacle 2. 
4. **(13.0, 4.0) to (13.0, 11.0):**  Move north, clearing the obstacle, and positioning for the final approach to the goal.
5. **(13.0, 11.0) to (19.0, 19.0):**  Move northeast directly towards a point within the goal set.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[17.2, 12.5], [19.2, 10.4], [19.5, 14.6], [18.2, 16.6]]
			Obstacle 2: [[10.8, 10.7], [10.7, 1.1], [16.8, 0.6], [17.4, 7.7]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 10.0)]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 10.0), (9.0, 4.0), (11.0, 3.0), (13.0, 3.0), (13.0, 11.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 3 between points (9.0, 4.0) and (11.0, 3.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 2: [[10.8, 10.7], [10.7, 1.1], [16.8, 0.6], [17.4, 7.7]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 10.0), (9.0, 4.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

[08/21/2024 04:15:04 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 2. Since we have a valid subpath ending at (9.0, 4.0), let's try to work from there.

1. **Analyzing the situation:**  We're below Obstacle 2 and need to head towards the goal. 
2. **Identifying a gap:** There's a clear path above Obstacle 2, leading towards the goal.
3. **Adjusting the path:** 
    * From (9.0, 4.0), move further down to (9.0, 2.0) to be well clear of Obstacle 2.
    * Head right, safely passing below Obstacle 2 with (16.0, 2.0).
    *  Finally, move up to enter the goal set at (19.0, 19.0).

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 10.0), (9.0, 4.0), (9.0, 2.0), (16.0, 2.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:15:10 PM] The issue is that segment from (9.0, 2.0) to (16.0, 2.0) cuts through Obstacle 2. To fix this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle. 

Since the path has already successfully reached the breakpoint (9.0, 10.0) and moved downwards from there, we can adjust the path to go around Obstacle 2. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, 10.0), 
    (9.0, 4.0),  
    (9.0, 1.0),   # Move further down to avoid Obstacle 2
    (12.0, 1.0),  # Move right, staying below Obstacle 2 
    (16.0, 1.0), # Continue right
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Move to the goal
]
```

This path first moves down to (9.0, 1.0), staying clear of Obstacle 2. Then, it moves right, maintaining a safe distance below the obstacle, before finally heading towards the goal.
