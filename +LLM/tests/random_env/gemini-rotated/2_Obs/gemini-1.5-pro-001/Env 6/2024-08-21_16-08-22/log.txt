# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[5.2, 6.1], [14.0, 9.4], [10.9, 12.2], [9.7, 11.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[15.7, 7.5], [17.8, 0.1], [18.1, 10.5], [16.2, 14.8]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 2.76), (9.0, 16.45)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:08:29 PM] Here's a possible path considering the provided data:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 2.76),   # Pass through breakpoint 1
    (10.0, 8.0),   # Navigate around obstacle 1
    (14.0, 15.0),  # Move towards the goal set 
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(1.0, 1.0):** Starts within the start quadrilateral.
2. **(9.0, 2.76):** Directly passes through the first breakpoint. 
3. **(10.0, 8.0):**  Steers clear of obstacle 1 by moving to the right and upwards.
4. **(14.0, 15.0):** Positions the path for a clear approach to the goal set, avoiding obstacle 2.
5. **(19.0, 19.0):**  Ends within the goal quadrilateral. 

**Important:** This path avoids direct contact with obstacles. However, it's crucial to visualize this path on a graph with the obstacles and sets plotted to ensure sufficient clearance and avoid any potential collisions.

[08/21/2024 04:08:39 PM] The provided path goes through obstacle 1. To circumvent it, we can leverage the breakpoint at (9.0, 16.45) from Set 1. 

Instead of going directly to the initially planned third waypoint (10.0, 8.0), we can first head towards the breakpoint (9.0, 16.45). From this breakpoint, a straight line to the goal set can be drawn without intersecting any obstacles. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Starting point
    (9.0, 2.76),  # First breakpoint
    (9.0, 16.45), # Second breakpoint

[08/21/2024 04:09:00 PM] The provided path goes through obstacle 1 because it tries to connect the two breakpoints in set 1 with a straight line. 

Instead of directly connecting the first breakpoint to the second, we can route the path around the left side of obstacle 1. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 2.76),   # First breakpoint
    (7.0, 5.0),    # Move left to circumvent obstacle 1 
    (7.0, 14.0),   # Move upwards, staying clear of obstacle 1
    (9.0, 16.45),  # Second breakpoint 
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set
] 
```

This path avoids obstacle 1 by first moving left, then upwards, and finally rejoining the original path to reach the second breakpoint. From there, it proceeds to the goal set.

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:09:06 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid Obstacle 1. Since we already passed breakpoint 1, we can try to navigate around Obstacle 1 to reach the goal.

Starting from the last valid point (7.0, 5.0):

1. **Move Right:**  Obstacle 1 extends furthest to the right at roughly x=14.0. Let's move further right to x=15.0 to avoid it. 
2. **Move Up:** Now clear of Obstacle 1, we can move up towards the goal. Aim for a y-value above Obstacle 1, like y=16.0.
3. **Move Right:** We are now clear to move directly towards the goal.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 2.76),
    (7.0, 5.0), 
    (15.0, 5.0), 
    (15.0, 16.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0) 
]
```
