# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[19.8, 12.4], [15.7, 13.5], [18.3, 1.8], [19.1, 4.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[13.9, 19.4], [5.3, 16.0], [17.8, 10.0], [18.1, 12.8]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 6.11), (9.0, 19.73)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:12:23 PM] Here's a possible path considering the obstacles and breakpoints:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start inside the start quadrilateral
    (9.0, 6.11),     # Pass through Breakpoint Set 1
    (10.0, 8.0),    # Navigate around Obstacle 2 
    (17.0, 17.0),   # Approach the goal from below Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 19.0)     # End inside the goal quadrilateral 
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(1.0, 1.0):**  Starts safely within the start quadrilateral.
2. **(9.0, 6.11):**  Directly targets and passes through the first breakpoint, avoiding any obstacles.
3. **(10.0, 8.0):**  Begins maneuvering around Obstacle 2, staying clear of its boundaries.
4. **(17.0, 17.0):**  Positions the path for a final approach to the goal, staying well below the corner of Obstacle 1.
5. **(19.0, 19.0):**  Safely reaches the goal quadrilateral. 

**Important:** This path description assumes a straight line between each waypoint. It's crucial to visually verify this path against a visualization of the obstacles and sets to ensure no collisions occur.

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 6.11), (10.0, 8.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:12:28 PM] The feedback indicates that the path intersects with Obstacle 2. To avoid this, we need to adjust the path to go around this obstacle. Since the path already reaches a breakpoint at (9.0, 6.11), we can try to navigate around Obstacle 2 from there.

Observing the position of Obstacle 2, we can see that we can navigate above it. Therefore, we can first move further up and then proceed rightwards, aiming to go above Obstacle 2 before heading towards the goal.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 6.11), 
    (9.0, 16.0),  # Move upwards, clearing Obstacle 2's highest point
    (16.0, 16.0), # Move rightwards, staying above Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Proceed to the goal
]
```

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:12:34 PM] The path needs to navigate around Obstacle 2 to reach the goal. The provided first breakpoint leads to a collision. Therefore we will use the second breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      // Start within the start set
    (9.0, 19.73),   // Move to the second breakpoint of Breakpoint Set 1, which avoids Obstacle 2 
    (16.0, 19.73),  // Move rightwards, staying clear of Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)   // Move to a point within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(1.0, 1.0) to (9.0, 19.73):** This segment moves directly to the second breakpoint, avoiding any obstacles.
2. **(9.0, 19.73) to (16.0, 19.73):** This segment moves horizontally, staying above Obstacle 2.
3. **(16.0, 19.73) to (19.0, 19.0):** This segment moves diagonally into the goal set.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:13:00 PM] The chosen breakpoint (9.0, 19.73) leads to a path that intersects with Obstacle 2. We need to find a way around this obstacle. 

Let's try going underneath Obstacle 2, as it seems less restrictive.  

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 6.11),  # Connect to the other breakpoint, going below Obstacle 2 
    (12.0, 6.11), # Move further right to avoid Obstacle 2
    (12.0, 19.0), # Move upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 2 
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Move right towards the goal set
]
```

This path aims to go below Obstacle 2 by utilizing the breakpoint (9.0, 6.11) and then navigate towards the goal set.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[19.8, 12.4], [15.7, 13.5], [18.3, 1.8], [19.1, 4.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[13.9, 19.4], [5.3, 16.0], [17.8, 10.0], [18.1, 12.8]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 6.11), (9.0, 19.73)]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 6.11), (12.0, 6.11), (12.0, 19.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 3 between points (12.0, 6.11) and (12.0, 19.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 2: [[13.9, 19.4], [5.3, 16.0], [17.8, 10.0], [18.1, 12.8]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 6.11), (12.0, 6.11)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:13:09 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid Obstacle 2. We can achieve this by going around the obstacle to the right. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 6.11),  # Pass through the breakpoint
    (12.0, 6.11), # Move further right to prepare for going around Obstacle 2
    (12.0, 15.0), # Move upward, staying clear of Obstacle 2
    (16.0, 15.0), # Move rightward, staying clear of Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Reach the goal within the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Initial Segment:** We keep the initial segments from the starting point (1.0, 1.0) to the breakpoint (9.0, 6.11) and further to (12.0, 6.11) as they were valid.

2. **Maneuvering Around Obstacle 2:**
   - Instead of directly going up from (12.0, 6.11) to (12.0, 19.0), we introduce waypoints to go around Obstacle 2:
     - (12.0, 15.0): Move upward, staying clear of the obstacle.
     - (16.0, 15.0): Move rightward, ensuring a safe distance from the obstacle.

3. **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, from (16.0, 15.0), we can move to the goal point (19.0, 19.0) without encountering any obstacles.

This adjusted path successfully avoids Obstacle 2 while still passing through the required breakpoint and reaching the goal.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:13:14 PM] The current path collides with Obstacle 2 because it tries to move directly upwards. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle. One option is to move further to the right before moving upwards. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 6.11),  # Pass through the breakpoint
    (15.0, 6.11), # Move further right to avoid Obstacle 2
    (15.0, 15.0), # Move upwards, clear of Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Move to the goal position
]
```

This path first goes through the breakpoint as the original one. Then, it moves further right to x=15.0, ensuring it's clear of Obstacle 2. Then, it moves upwards to y=15.0 and finally reaches the goal point.
