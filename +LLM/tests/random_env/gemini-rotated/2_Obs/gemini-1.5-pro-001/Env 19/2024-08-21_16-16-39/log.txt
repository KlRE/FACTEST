# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[11.2, 6.1], [16.4, 6.3], [20.0, 14.0], [16.4, 11.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[8.0, 13.5], [11.3, 8.9], [16.0, 19.7], [8.8, 14.8]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 5.05), (9.0, 18.46)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

[08/21/2024 04:17:14 PM] The current path attempts to cross Obstacle 2 by moving directly upwards. To avoid this, we can adjust the path to navigate around the obstacle.

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Valid Subpath:** We can utilize the valid subpath provided: [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 5.05), (10.0, 7.0)]. 

2. **Navigating Around Obstacle 2:** From (10.0, 7.0), we need to move rightwards, giving Obstacle 2 a wide berth. A safe waypoint could be (14.0, 7.0).

3. **Moving Upwards:** Now clear of Obstacle 2, we can proceed upwards towards the goal. A waypoint at (14.0, 16.0) positions us well.

4. **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, we can move horizontally to enter the goal set. A suitable endpoint is (19.0, 19.0).

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 5.05), (10.0, 7.0), (14.0, 7.0), (14.0, 16.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:17:21 PM] The provided path collides with Obstacle 1 because it attempts to move horizontally across the obstacle's shortest side. A better strategy is to navigate above this obstacle. 

Here's an adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set 
    (9.0, 5.05),  # Pass through the breakpoint 
    (9.0, 15.0),  # Move vertically upward, staying clear of Obstacle 1 
    (14.0, 15.0), # Move horizontally towards the goal, staying above Obstacle 1
    (14.0, 19.0), # Move vertically to align with the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Reach a point within the goal set 
] 
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Vertical Movement:** Instead of immediately moving horizontally, the path first moves vertically upward to a point  (9.0, 15.0). This places the path well above Obstacle 1. 

2. **Horizontal Traversal:** From this elevated position, the path moves horizontally towards the goal, staying clear of Obstacle 1.

3. **Final Approach:** The path then adjusts its vertical position again to align with the goal set and finally reaches a point within it.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[11.2, 6.1], [16.4, 6.3], [20.0, 14.0], [16.4, 11.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[8.0, 13.5], [11.3, 8.9], [16.0, 19.7], [8.8, 14.8]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 5.05), (9.0, 18.46)]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 5.05), (9.0, 15.0), (14.0, 15.0), (14.0, 19.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 2 between points (9.0, 5.05) and (9.0, 15.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 2: [[8.0, 13.5], [11.3, 8.9], [16.0, 19.7], [8.8, 14.8]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 5.05)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:17:27 PM] The provided path collides with Obstacle 2 because it attempts to go vertically straight from the breakpoint. To avoid this, we can adjust the path to navigate around Obstacle 2.

We can achieve this by adding an additional waypoint to the right of Obstacle 2, allowing for a detour.  

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 5.05),  # Pass through the breakpoint
    (12.0, 5.05), # Move right, maintaining a safe distance from Obstacle 2
    (12.0, 15.0), # Move upwards, clear of Obstacle 2
    (14.0, 15.0), # Continue towards the goal 
    (14.0, 19.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End within the goal set
] 
```

This new path avoids both obstacles while successfully passing through the required breakpoint and reaching the goal set.
