# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[12.2, 19.2], [17.9, 6.3], [19.4, 12.0], [14.2, 18.2]]
			Obstacle 2: [[9.1, 15.1], [3.3, 11.9], [3.5, 11.8], [11.7, 13.5]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 5.47), (9.0, 18.52)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:07:27 PM] The path can be planned to first move towards Breakpoint Set 1 while avoiding Obstacle 2, then continue towards the goal set while avoiding Obstacle 1.

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), # start in the start set
    (9.0, 5.47), # move to the breakpoint of Breakpoint Set 1
    (10.0, 7.0), # move further away from Obstacle 2

[08/21/2024 04:08:00 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 1. The current valid subpath takes us to a point where we can navigate around Obstacle 1 by going below it.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Original start point
    (9.0, 5.47), # Breakpoint 1
    (10.0, 7.0), 
    (10.0, 4.0), 
    (16.0, 4.0), # Last valid point before collision
    (16.0, 2.0), # Move south to go below Obstacle 1
    (18.0, 2.0), # Move east towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End point within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Maintain Valid Subpath:**  The path keeps the initial segments as they successfully navigate to the breakpoint and around the initial part of Obstacle 1.
2. **Navigate Below Obstacle:** From the last valid point (16.0, 4.0), the path moves south to (16.0, 2.0),  clearing the southernmost point of Obstacle 1. 
3. **Proceed East:**  The path then moves east to (18.0, 2.0), ensuring a safe distance from Obstacle 1.
4. **Reach Goal:** Finally, the path moves to (19.0, 19.0), which lies within the goal set, successfully completing the navigation task.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:08:04 PM] The issue is with the last segment crossing obstacle 1. We can circumvent this by routing the path around the obstacle. 

Since we already reached a safe point at (18.0, 2.0), let's continue from there. 

We can navigate below Obstacle 1 by adding a waypoint to the right and below the obstacle. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 5.47), (10.0, 7.0), (10.0, 4.0), (16.0, 4.0), (16.0, 2.0), (18.0, 2.0), (20.0, 2.0), (19.0, 19.0)]
```

This path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles while successfully reaching the goal set.
