# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.2, 15.4], [18.4, 16.0], [13.7, 16.4], [9.9, 16.1]]
			Obstacle 2: [[19.7, 15.5], [16.5, 14.0], [16.5, 12.6], [16.8, 10.9]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 6.76), (9.0, 18.96)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

[08/21/2024 04:11:50 PM] The proposed path went directly up from the valid breakpoint, colliding with Obstacle 1. To avoid this, we can route the path around the right side of Obstacle 1. 

We can achieve this by adding a waypoint to the right of Obstacle 1 and above it to ensure clearance. From there, we can proceed to the goal. 

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set 
    (9.0, 6.76),  # Pass through Breakpoint Set 1

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:11:55 PM] The current path collides with Obstacle 1 because it attempts to move directly from the breakpoint to the goal region. To circumvent this, we need to navigate around the obstacle. 

Let's modify the path to go around Obstacle 1 by first moving horizontally to the right, then upwards, and finally towards the goal:

**New Path:**
```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point
    (9.0, 6.76),   # Breakpoint 
    (14.0, 6.76),  # Move right, staying below Obstacle 1
    (14.0, 17.0),  # Move upwards, clear of Obstacle 1 
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Proceed to the goal
] 
```

This new path avoids crossing any obstacles by going around the right side of Obstacle 1.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.2, 15.4], [18.4, 16.0], [13.7, 16.4], [9.9, 16.1]]
			Obstacle 2: [[19.7, 15.5], [16.5, 14.0], [16.5, 12.6], [16.8, 10.9]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 6.76), (9.0, 18.96)]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 6.76), (9.0, 14.0), (14.0, 14.0), (14.0, 17.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 4 between points (14.0, 14.0) and (14.0, 17.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 1: [[6.2, 15.4], [18.4, 16.0], [13.7, 16.4], [9.9, 16.1]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 6.76), (9.0, 14.0), (14.0, 14.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:12:09 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid going through Obstacle 1. Since we already reached a breakpoint and going further right at the current y-value would lead to another collision, we need to go upwards before moving right.

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), # start in the start set
    (9.0, 6.76), # reach breakpoint
    (9.0, 18.0), # move upwards to avoid Obstacle 1, staying clear from the y-coordinate 16.4 of Obstacle 1's vertex
    (14.0, 18.0), # move right 
    (19.0, 19.0) # reach a point in the goal set

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:12:16 PM] The current path collides with obstacle 1 because it tries to go straight up from the breakpoint. 
To avoid this, we can navigate around the right side of the obstacle. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      // Start point
    (9.0, 6.76),     // Breakpoint 1
    (12.0, 6.76),    // Move right, staying clear of Obstacle 1
    (12.0, 18.0),    // Move upwards, clear of Obstacle 1
    (14.0, 18.0),    // Continue towards goal
    (19.0, 19.0)     // End point
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1.  **From Breakpoint 1:** Instead of moving straight up, we first move right to  `(12.0, 6.76)`. This keeps us clear of Obstacle 1's right edge.
2.  **Moving Upwards:** Once clear of Obstacle 1's height, we move up to `(12.0, 18.0)`.
3.  **Continuing to Goal:** We rejoin the original path's trajectory and proceed to the goal.
