# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[17.7, 15.9], [7.6, 14.8], [8.5, 8.3], [14.5, 8.4]]
			Obstacle 2: [[19.0, 17.9], [15.7, 17.1], [15.9, 16.9], [19.8, 16.2]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 3.15), (9.0, 18.48)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:13:22 PM] Here's a possible path considering the provided obstacles and breakpoints:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),          # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 3.15),         # Pass through Breakpoint Set 1 
    (10.0, 8.0),         # Navigate around Obstacle 1, keeping a safe distance
    (17.0, 15.0),        # Approach the goal set while avoiding obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)          # End within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

* **(1.0, 1.0):** Starts within the start quadrilateral.
* **(9.0, 3.15):**  Directly targets and passes through the first breakpoint.
* **(10.0, 8.0):**  Moves further away from Obstacle 1 to avoid a collision.
* **(17.0, 15.0):** Carefully positions the path to approach the goal set while staying clear of both Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2.
* **(19.0, 19.0):**  Safely arrives within the goal quadrilateral. 

**Important:** This path is a visual estimation based on the provided coordinates. It's crucial to perform precise geometric calculations to guarantee that the path segments don't intersect with any obstacles.

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 3.15), (10.0, 8.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:13:26 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 1. Since we already passed through a breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1, we can route the path around Obstacle 1.

We can achieve this by adding a waypoint that goes around Obstacle 1. 

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 3.15), 
    (10.0, 8.0), 
    (16.0, 7.0), # new waypoint to guide the path around Obstacle 1

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/21/2024 04:13:55 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid the obstacles. The suggested path goes below obstacle 1, then attempts to go up to the goal, intersecting the obstacles. Instead, let's try going above obstacle 1 and 2 to reach the goal.

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 3.15),  # Pass through the breakpoint
    (10.0, 8.0),  # Continue moving upwards to stay above obstacle 1
    (16.0, 10.0), # Move rightwards while staying above obstacle 1

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[17.7, 15.9], [7.6, 14.8], [8.5, 8.3], [14.5, 8.4]]
			Obstacle 2: [[19.0, 17.9], [15.7, 17.1], [15.9, 16.9], [19.8, 16.2]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 3.15), (9.0, 18.48)]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 3.15), (10.0, 8.0), (16.0, 10.0), (17.0, 18.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 3 between points (10.0, 8.0) and (16.0, 10.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 1: [[17.7, 15.9], [7.6, 14.8], [8.5, 8.3], [14.5, 8.4]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 3.15), (10.0, 8.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:13:59 PM] The path needs to reroute to avoid Obstacle 1. Since we already passed Breakpoint Set 1 with the second waypoint, the path can be adjusted by going around Obstacle 1.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:14:05 PM] The path goes through obstacles because it tries to move directly upwards from (17.0, 7.0) to (17.0, 18.0). To avoid this, we can adjust the path to go around Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2.

We can accomplish this by making the path move diagonally upwards and to the right after reaching breakpoint (9.0, 3.15), then continue rightward, and finally move diagonally upwards to the left to reach the goal set. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, 3.15), 
    (10.0, 8.0), 
    (14.0, 12.0),  # Move diagonally upwards to the right
    (16.0, 12.0),  # Continue rightward
    (17.0, 14.0),  # Move diagonally upwards to the right
    (18.0, 16.0),  # Move diagonally upwards to the right
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Reach the goal set
]
```
