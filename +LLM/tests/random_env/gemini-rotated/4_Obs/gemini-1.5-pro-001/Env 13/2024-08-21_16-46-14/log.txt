# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.8, 8.1], [16.7, 0.5], [18.7, 12.0], [17.0, 12.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[19.8, 15.9], [14.5, 17.4], [16.2, 15.6], [18.1, 15.5]]
			Obstacle 3: [[11.3, 18.0], [13.1, 15.1], [18.6, 14.7], [15.1, 17.5]]
			Obstacle 4: [[12.5, 19.2], [7.6, 17.6], [9.7, 17.0], [14.8, 18.1]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 7.6), (9.0, 20.02)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/21/2024 04:46:28 PM] This path avoids the obstacles by navigating between them and utilizes the provided breakpoints:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 7.6),      # Breakpoint Set 1
    (10.0, 8.0),     # Navigate around Obstacle 1
    (16.0, 14.0),    # Navigate between Obstacles 1 and 3 
    (17.0, 16.0),    # Navigate between Obstacles 2 and 3
    (14.0, 19.0),    # Navigate around Obstacle 4
    (9.0, 20.02),     # Breakpoint Set 1
    (19.0, 19.0),    # Approach the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)      # End within the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation:**

* The path starts within the start set and immediately heads towards the first breakpoint of Breakpoint Set 1.
* After passing through the breakpoint, it carefully maneuvers around Obstacle 1, maintaining a safe distance. 
* It then charts a course between Obstacles 1 and 3, finding a safe passage through the gap.
* Continuing its journey, the path carefully avoids Obstacle 2 by passing through the space between obstacles 2 and 3.
* It then curves around Obstacle 4, ensuring it doesn't intersect with the obstacle's boundaries.
* Next, it passes through the second breakpoint in Breakpoint set 1. 
* Finally, it moves towards the goal set, ensuring it finishes within its boundaries.

This path demonstrates a successful strategy for navigating the given obstacles while adhering to the specified requirements.

		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

]

[08/21/2024 04:46:38 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacles 2 and 3. We can achieve this by navigating around the obstacles.

1. **Valid Subpath:** The provided feedback indicates that the subpath  [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 7.6), (10.0, 8.0), (16.0, 14.0)] is valid. We can continue building upon this.

2. **Navigating Around Obstacles:** Instead of directly moving towards the goal set from (16.0, 14.0), we need to navigate around Obstacles 2 and 3.

3. **Adjusting the Path:**

   - From (16.0, 14.0),  move further right to (17.0, 14.0) to create some distance from Obstacle 3.
   - Next, move upwards to (17.0, 17.0) to bypass Obstacle 2.
   - Then, head left towards (14.0, 17.0), safely passing above Obstacle 3.
   - Continue left to reach (9.0, 17.0).
   - Finally, move upwards to the breakpoint (9.0, 20.02) and then proceed to the goal set (19.0, 19.0).

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 7.6), (10.0, 8.0), (16.0, 14.0), (17.0, 14.0), (17.0, 17.0), (14.0, 17.0), (9.0, 17.0), (9.0, 20.02), (19.0, 19.0)]

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/21/2024 04:47:03 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 3. Currently, the path attempts to move from the breakpoint (9.0, 7.6) directly to (10.0, 8.0), which cuts through the obstacle. 

Instead, we should leverage the second breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1: (9.0, 20.02). 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      // Start Point
    (9.0, 7.6),      // Breakpoint 1
    (9.0, 20.02),     // Breakpoint 2 - Navigate around obstacles vertically
    (19.0, 19.0)      // Goal Point
]
```

This new path first travels to the first breakpoint, then goes vertically along the x=9.0 line to the second breakpoint, effectively circumventing Obstacle 3. From there, it's a clear path to the goal point.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.8, 8.1], [16.7, 0.5], [18.7, 12.0], [17.0, 12.8]]

[08/21/2024 04:47:08 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid Obstacle 4. Instead of going directly up to the breakpoint (9.0, 20.02), we can route the path around the left side of Obstacle 4.

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start in the start set
    (9.0, 7.6),  # Go to the first breakpoint
    (7.0, 17.0), # Move to the left of Obstacle 4
    (7.0, 20.02), # Move up to clear Obstacle 4 
    (9.0, 20.02), # Head back to the desired x-coordinate
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Continue to the goal set
