# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[14.9, 18.4], [13.3, 11.5], [15.9, 16.0], [16.0, 17.7]]
			Obstacle 2: [[6.8, 16.6], [17.8, 16.7], [17.2, 18.0], [10.9, 17.4]]
			Obstacle 3: [[15.8, 17.1], [15.2, 13.2], [16.0, 12.1], [17.7, 16.4]]
			Obstacle 4: [[9.5, 13.0], [8.9, 5.8], [15.9, 6.8], [19.0, 12.9]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 1.9), (9.0, 11.81), (9.0, 19.51)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:44:16 PM] Here's a possible path considering the provided data:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 1.9),    # Pass through Breakpoint 1
    (10.0, 8.0),   # Navigate around Obstacle 4 
    (17.0, 10.0),  # Position to approach the goal from below Obstacles 1, 2, and 3
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation:**

* **(2.0, 1.0):**  Starts within the start quadrilateral.
* **(9.0, 1.9):**  Passes directly through the first breakpoint.
* **(10.0, 8.0):**  Moves upward and slightly to the right, safely navigating around the bottom-right corner of Obstacle 4.
* **(17.0, 10.0):** Continues to the right, positioning itself below the cluster of Obstacles 1, 2, and 3. This allows for a safe approach to the goal.
* **(19.0, 19.0):** Moves directly upward to the goal, ending within the goal quadrilateral.

**Important:** This path description assumes a visual inspection of the quadrilaterals.  It's crucial to verify this path by plotting it along with the obstacles to ensure there are no intersections.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:44:23 PM] The current path fails because the segment between the breakpoint (9.0, 1.9) and the next waypoint (10.0, 8.0) cuts through Obstacle 4. 

To fix this, we should route the path to go around Obstacle 4. Since the goal is to the top-right, we want to navigate above Obstacle 4.  

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0),   # Start point
    (9.0, 1.9),   # Breakpoint Set 1
    (9.0, 14.0),  # Move up, staying clear of Obstacle 4
    (17.0, 14.0), # Move right, staying clear of Obstacles 2 and 3
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Goal point 
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1.  **(9.0, 14.0):**  This new waypoint moves the path vertically upward, ensuring it clears the top of Obstacle 4 (whose highest point has a y-coordinate of roughly 13.0).
2.  **(17.0, 14.0):** This waypoint moves the path horizontally to the right. This ensures it stays clear of both Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3 while approaching the goal. 

This new path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles while ensuring it passes through the required breakpoint.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data

[08/21/2024 04:45:09 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 4. Since the path needs to pass through (9.0, 1.9), routing the path above Obstacle 4 seems like a reasonable solution.

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:45:14 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid Obstacle 4. Since we have a valid path until the breakpoint (9.0, 1.9), we can try to find a way around Obstacle 4 from there. 

One option is to move further to the right before going up. Let's try going to (13.0, 1.9) and then straight up to (13.0, 14.0). From there, we can move right and slightly upward to reach the goal set at (19.0, 19.0).

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, 1.9), 
    (13.0, 1.9), 
    (13.0, 14.0),
