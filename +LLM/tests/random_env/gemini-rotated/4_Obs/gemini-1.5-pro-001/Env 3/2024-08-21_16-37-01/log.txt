# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[0.6, 12.5], [8.2, 8.5], [9.6, 17.3], [1.6, 13.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[13.6, 16.4], [14.7, 11.9], [17.0, 15.6], [15.8, 17.3]]
			Obstacle 3: [[2.3, 7.2], [9.7, 0.9], [12.2, 14.1], [9.7, 14.3]]
			Obstacle 4: [[14.3, 18.0], [10.8, 19.7], [11.4, 15.8], [14.0, 16.5]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, -0.26), (9.0, 19.52)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:37:08 PM] Here is a possible path considering the provided data:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (9.0, -0.26),   # Pass through Breakpoint Set 1 
    (10.0, 3.0),   # Navigate around Obstacle 3
    (17.0, 8.0),   # Maneuver between Obstacles 2 and 4
    (9.0, 19.52),  # Pass through Breakpoint Set 2
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

* The path starts at (1.0, 1.0) which is inside the start set.
* It then moves towards the first breakpoint (9.0, -0.26) avoiding Obstacle 1.
* From there, it curves around Obstacle 3, staying a safe distance away. 
* The path continues, carefully maneuvering between Obstacles 2 and 4.
* It then reaches the second breakpoint (9.0, 19.52).
* Finally, the path proceeds to the goal set, ending at (19.0, 19.0).

**Important:** This path is a visual estimation based on the given coordinates. It's crucial to mathematically verify the distances to ensure complete obstacle avoidance.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:37:20 PM] The current path collides with obstacles because it tries to move directly upwards at x = 9.0. This line intersects with both Obstacles 1 and 3. 

Instead, we can navigate around the obstacles by first moving right and then upwards. Since we already reached breakpoint (9.0, -0.26), let's continue the path from there.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, -0.26),  
    (12.0, -0.26),  # Move right to avoid Obstacle 3 
    (12.0, 16.0),  # Move upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 1 
    (9.0, 19.52), # head towards the breakpoint
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Proceed to the goal 
]
```

This path avoids obstacles by:

1.  **Moving right**: Shifting to x = 12.0 clears Obstacle 3.
2.  **Moving upwards**: Going up at x = 12.0 avoids both Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3.
3. **Utilizing Breakpoints:** Leveraging the breakpoint (9.0, 19.52) ensures a smooth transition towards the goal. 

This route successfully navigates the obstacles to reach the goal.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:37:24 PM] The problem arises when the path tries to move upwards at x = 12.0 since this line intersects with Obstacles 3 and 4. 
To avoid this, we can reroute the path by going right first, then upwards.

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, -0.26), 
    (15.0, -0.26), # move right to avoid Obstacles 3 & 4
    (15.0, 19.0), # move upwards
    (19.0, 19.0) # reach the goal
]

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[0.6, 12.5], [8.2, 8.5], [9.6, 17.3], [1.6, 13.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[13.6, 16.4], [14.7, 11.9], [17.0, 15.6], [15.8, 17.3]]
			Obstacle 3: [[2.3, 7.2], [9.7, 0.9], [12.2, 14.1], [9.7, 14.3]]
			Obstacle 4: [[14.3, 18.0], [10.8, 19.7], [11.4, 15.8], [14.0, 16.5]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, -0.26), (9.0, 19.52)]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, -0.26), (15.0, -0.26), (15.0, 19.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:37:29 PM] The current path collides with Obstacle 2 because it attempts to move directly upwards at x=15.0. To avoid this, we need to route the path around this obstacle. 

Since we already reached a breakpoint in the previous segment and there are no more breakpoint requirements, we can focus on reaching the goal set.

We can achieve this by continuing the path towards the right from the last valid waypoint (15.0, -0.26) until we clear Obstacle 2, then moving upwards towards the goal set.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, -0.26), 
    (15.0, -0.26), 
    (17.5, -0.26),  # Continue rightwards to clear Obstacle 2
    (17.5, 19.0),  # Move upwards 
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Reach the goal set 
]
```
