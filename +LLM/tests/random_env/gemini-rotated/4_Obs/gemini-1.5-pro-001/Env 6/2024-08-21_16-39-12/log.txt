# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[0.1, 15.0], [14.1, 11.7], [4.3, 17.3], [0.4, 15.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[12.0, 8.7], [16.2, 6.2], [15.9, 11.4], [13.1, 13.3]]
			Obstacle 3: [[12.9, 13.2], [10.5, 3.5], [19.0, 3.8], [20.0, 10.8]]
			Obstacle 4: [[3.1, 19.6], [4.7, 11.2], [11.4, 16.4], [9.7, 19.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 5.45), (9.0, 20.53)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:39:19 PM] Here's a possible path considering the obstacles and breakpoints:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start inside the start quadrilateral
    (9.0, 5.45),     # Pass through Breakpoint Set 1
    (10.0, 6.0),    # Navigate between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2
    (17.0, 10.0),   # Move towards the goal, staying clear of Obstacle 3 
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End inside the goal quadrilateral 
]
```

**Explanation:**

* **(1.0, 1.0):**  Starts safely within the start quadrilateral.
* **(9.0, 5.45):** This waypoint takes the path directly through the first breakpoint, as required.
* **(10.0, 6.0):**  This maneuver carefully navigates the path between Obstacles 1 and 2, maintaining a safe distance.
* **(17.0, 10.0):** The path continues towards the goal, strategically staying clear of Obstacle 3.
* **(19.0, 19.0):**  Finally, the path reaches a point safely within the goal quadrilateral.

**Important:** This path is a visual estimation based on the provided coordinates. It's crucial to verify the path's safety and clearance from obstacles using appropriate geometric calculations or visualization tools in a real-world application.

    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate

]

[08/21/2024 04:39:25 PM] The provided path collides with obstacles 2 and 3. To circumvent this, we can adjust the path to navigate above these obstacles. Since the path has already successfully reached breakpoint (9.0, 5.45), we can leverage this point to steer clear of the obstacles.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, 5.45), 
    (9.0, 15.0), # Move vertically upward to bypass obstacle 2 and 3
    (17.0, 15.0), # Move horizontally towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Reach the goal
]
```

This revised path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles while adhering to the specified criteria:

- **Start and End:** It begins within the start set and concludes within the goal set.
- **Breakpoints:** It traverses the breakpoint (9.0, 5.45).
- **Non-Crossing:**  It avoids intersecting any obstacles.

[08/21/2024 04:39:36 PM] The issue arises when the path tries to go from (9.0, 5.45) to (9.0, 15.0) directly through the obstacles. 

We can circumvent this by navigating around the obstacles. Here's how:

1.  **Valid Subpath:** The feedback tells us that the path is valid until (9.0, 5.45). Let's start from there.
2.  **Avoiding Obstacles:** Obstacles 1 and 4 are positioned above this point. We need to move horizontally to avoid them. 
3.  **Reaching the Goal:**  We can safely move rightward,  clearing the obstacles, and then upwards towards the goal.

Considering this, here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, 5.45), 
    (15.0, 5.45),  # Move right, clearing obstacles

[08/21/2024 04:39:59 PM] The provided path collides with obstacle 3. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate above obstacle 3. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 5.45),  # Pass through the breakpoint 
    (9.0, 15.0),  # Move upwards to be above obstacle 3 
    (15.0, 15.0), # Move rightwards, staying clear of obstacle 3
    (15.0, 19.0), # Move downwards towards the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Start:** The path starts at (1.0, 1.0) which is inside the start set.
2. **Breakpoint:** The path goes through the breakpoint (9.0, 5.45).
3. **Avoidance:**  Instead of moving directly to the right, the path first goes upwards to (9.0, 15.0), bypassing obstacle 3.
4. **Clear Path:** From (9.0, 15.0), the path can safely move right to (15.0, 15.0) as it's clear of all obstacles.
5. **Goal Approach:** Finally, the path moves down to (15.0, 19.0) and then right to (19.0, 19.0), reaching the goal set.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:40:05 PM] The current path attempts to go up vertically from the breakpoint, colliding with obstacles 1 and 4. To circumvent this, we can navigate around the obstacles by moving horizontally first.

From the last valid point (9.0, 5.45), we can move horizontally to the right, away from obstacles 1 and 4. Once we have enough clearance, we can proceed upwards towards the goal.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start point
    (9.0, 5.45),  # Breakpoint Set 1
    (12.0, 5.45), # Move rightward, clear of Obstacles 1 & 4
    (12.0, 19.0), # Move upward, clear of Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Goal point 
]
```

This path first moves to the breakpoint, then maneuvers around obstacles 1 and 4 by moving horizontally to the right. Once clear, it moves upwards to bypass obstacle 2, finally reaching the goal.

[08/21/2024 04:40:12 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 3. Since the current path hits a dead-end at the first breakpoint of Breakpoint Set 1, we need to consider the second breakpoint. 

Let's try approaching the problem from the goal set and aiming for the second breakpoint (9.0, 20.53):

1. **Start at the goal:** Begin from a point within the goal set, such as (19.0, 19.0).
2. **Move towards the breakpoint:** Head towards the second breakpoint (9.0, 20.53).
3. **Navigate around obstacles:**  Observe that a direct path from the goal to the breakpoint is blocked by Obstacle 4. To circumvent this, first move slightly left to (12.0, 20.53), then proceed to the breakpoint (9.0, 20.53). 
4. **Reach the start:** From the breakpoint, navigate around Obstacle 1 by moving to (9.0, 1.0), and finally reach a point within the start set, for instance, (1.0, 1.0).

Therefore, a revised path could be:

```
new_path = [(19.0, 19.0), (12.0, 20.53), (9.0, 20.53), (9.0, 1.0), (1.0, 1.0)]
