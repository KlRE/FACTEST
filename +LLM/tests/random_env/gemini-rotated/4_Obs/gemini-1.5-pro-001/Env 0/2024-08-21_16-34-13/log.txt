# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[2.8, 16.7], [4.1, 16.0], [6.4, 19.2], [4.7, 18.5]]

			Obstacle 4: [[3.1, 1.3], [12.6, 3.3], [12.1, 4.9], [7.0, 7.2]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 0.27), (9.0, 6.88), (9.0, 15.99)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/21/2024 04:34:26 PM] Here is a possible path considering the provided data and constraints:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 0.27),   # Pass through the first breakpoint 
    (12.0, 3.0),  # Navigate around obstacles, maintaining a safe distance
    (16.0, 8.0),  # Continue moving towards the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation:**

* **(1.0, 1.0):**  Starts safely within the start set quadrilateral.
* **(9.0, 0.27):** This waypoint takes the path directly to the first breakpoint of Breakpoint Set 1.
* **(12.0, 3.0):** This point is crucial for obstacle avoidance. It's chosen to steer clear of Obstacle 4 while setting a course around the more complex cluster of Obstacles 1, 2, and 3.
* **(16.0, 8.0):**  Continuing on a trajectory that avoids all obstacles, this waypoint positions the path for a smooth final approach to the goal.
* **(19.0, 19.0):** The path concludes within the goal set quadrilateral.

**Important:** This path is a visual estimation based on the provided coordinates. It's highly recommended to visualize these points on a graph with the obstacles plotted to confirm obstacle avoidance.

    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:34:31 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with obstacles 3 and 4. Since the path is invalid after the second waypoint, a new strategy is to navigate above those obstacles. 

From the last valid waypoint (9.0, 0.27), the path can be adjusted to move upwards, clearing obstacle 4, and then proceed right towards the goal, staying clear of obstacle 3.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, 0.27), 
    (9.0, 10.0),  # Move upwards to clear obstacles 3 & 4
    (16.0, 10.0), # Move right, staying clear of obstacle 3
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Move to the goal
]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:34:37 PM] The current path collides with obstacles 3 and 4 as it goes up vertically. It seems like directly going up from the chosen breakpoint is not feasible. Instead, we can try to navigate around the obstacles by first moving to the right and then upwards.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 0.27),  # Reach Breakpoint Set 1 
    (13.0, 0.27), # Move right, staying below Obstacle 4
    (13.0, 10.0), # Move upwards, clear of Obstacle 3
    (16.0, 10.0), # Move right towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End within the goal set
]
```

This new path attempts to avoid obstacles by:

1. **Moving right first:** Instead of directly going up, it navigates to the right, staying below the lower bounds of Obstacles 3 and 4.
2. **Then moving upwards:** Once clear of the obstacles' horizontal span, the path moves upwards to reach the same y-coordinate as the goal set. 

This is just one possible adjustment, and further refinement might be needed depending on the exact dimensions and positioning of the obstacles.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:34:41 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 3. Since the path is blocked moving upwards at x = 13.0, we can try going to the right and maneuvering around Obstacle 3.

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, 0.27), 
    (13.0, 0.27), 
    (17.0, 0.27), # move right to clear Obstacle 3
    (17.0, 10.0), # move upwards

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
