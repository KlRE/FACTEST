# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[8.6, 17.6], [17.7, 16.1], [14.8, 18.1], [10.0, 19.6]]
			Obstacle 2: [[17.6, 18.6], [15.1, 19.5], [15.5, 16.6], [15.8, 16.1]]
			Obstacle 3: [[4.3, 15.5], [4.7, 15.2], [11.7, 17.0], [5.7, 16.6]]
			Obstacle 4: [[16.4, 19.0], [15.5, 17.7], [16.2, 15.5], [17.5, 14.3]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 7.15), (9.0, 17.17), (9.0, 20.08)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:35:12 PM] Here is a possible path considering the provided obstacles and breakpoints:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),                # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 7.15),               # Pass through Breakpoint Set 1
    (9.5, 12.0),              # Navigate between obstacles 3 and 1
    (9.0, 17.17),              # Pass through Breakpoint Set 1
    (12.0, 19.0),             # Move towards the goal, staying clear of obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)              # End within the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation:**

* The path starts within the start set at (1.0, 1.0).
* It then moves towards the first breakpoint at (9.0, 7.15), safely passing below obstacle 3.
* Continuing upward, it goes through (9.5, 12.0), maneuvering between obstacles 3 and 1.
* Reaching the second breakpoint of Set 1 at (9.0, 17.17), the path changes direction.
* It then moves rightward to (12.0, 19.0), maintaining a safe distance from obstacle 2.
* Finally, the path proceeds to (19.0, 19.0), ending within the goal set.

**Important:** This path is a visual estimation based on the given coordinates. It's crucial to verify obstacle clearances precisely using their geometric definitions.

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:35:20 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid crossing Obstacle 1. Since the problematic segment starts at breakpoint (9.0, 17.17), a different breakpoint needs to be chosen. 

Looking at the Breakpoint Set 1, (9.0, 7.15) seems like a better alternative. From this breakpoint, the path can move directly towards the goal set without intersecting any obstacles.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, 7.15), 
    (19.0, 19.0) 
]

    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:35:25 PM] The current path directly crosses Obstacle 1 and 4. We need to adjust it to navigate around these obstacles. Since the second waypoint (9.0, 7.15) leads to a collision, let's try a different breakpoint from Set 1 to see if it provides a clearer path. The third breakpoint (9.0, 20.08) seems promising as it allows us to go around Obstacle 1 and potentially maneuver towards the goal.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  
    (9.0, 20.08), 
    (10.0, 20.08),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]

This path starts within the start set, goes up to the third breakpoint of Set 1 to avoid Obstacle 1, then moves right, safely bypassing the obstacle, and finally reaches the goal set.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[8.6, 17.6], [17.7, 16.1], [14.8, 18.1], [10.0, 19.6]]
			Obstacle 2: [[17.6, 18.6], [15.1, 19.5], [15.5, 16.6], [15.8, 16.1]]
