# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.3, 13.8], [15.9, 7.8], [17.9, 7.8], [15.5, 16.3]]
			Obstacle 2: [[12.7, 15.1], [17.4, 18.1], [15.8, 18.7], [13.5, 18.0]]

			Obstacle 4: [[3.8, 19.2], [4.4, 12.9], [5.3, 15.6], [4.0, 19.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 7.2), (9.0, 19.87)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/21/2024 04:49:10 PM] Here is a possible path considering the provided data:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 7.2),    # Pass through breakpoint 1
    (10.0, 8.0),   # Navigate around obstacle 1
    (16.0, 12.0),  # Move towards the goal, staying clear of obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(1.0, 1.0):**  Starts within the start quadrilateral.
2. **(9.0, 7.2):**  Directly targets and passes through the first breakpoint.
3. **(10.0, 8.0):**  This slight eastward movement is crucial to begin navigating around the southwest corner of Obstacle 1. 
4. **(16.0, 12.0):**  This waypoint positions the path safely between Obstacles 1 and 2. The path maintains a safe distance from the corners of these obstacles.
5. **(19.0, 19.0):**  A direct movement into the goal quadrilateral.

**Important:** This is a visual inspection and might need minor adjustments to perfectly avoid obstacles. It's always recommended to verify the path using graphical tools or algorithms for precise obstacle avoidance.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:49:16 PM] The suggested path goes too far east before heading south, causing the collision with Obstacle 1.  Instead, we should try going south sooner, aiming to pass between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 7.2),   # Pass through the breakpoint 
    (9.0, 10.0),  # Continue south, staying clear of Obstacle 1
    (16.0, 10.0), # Move east, staying clear of Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Arrive at the goal set 
]
```

This path aims to:

1. **Start** within the start set.
2. **Pass through the breakpoint** (9.0, 7.2) as required.
3. **Move south** to a y-coordinate that's safely below Obstacle 1.
4. **Move east** at a y-coordinate that remains clear of both Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2. 
5. **Arrive** within the goal set.

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:49:22 PM] The current path collides with Obstacle 1 because it tries to move horizontally across the map. There is, however, a clear path upwards if we hug the left side of Obstacle 1. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 7.2),   # Pass through the breakpoint
    (9.0, 16.0),  # Move upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 1
    (16.0, 16.0), # Move rightwards, staying above Obstacle 1 
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Vertical Movement:** Instead of immediately moving horizontally, the adjusted path first moves vertically upwards to avoid Obstacle 1. 
2. **Hugging Obstacles:** The path stays close to the edge of Obstacle 1 to maximize free space and avoid potential conflicts with other obstacles. 
3. **Clear Horizontal Path:** Once above Obstacle 1, there is a clear horizontal path to the goal position. 

This adjusted path considers the spatial relationships between the obstacles and uses a combination of vertical and horizontal movements to reach the goal safely.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:49:26 PM] The current path fails because it tries to move horizontally across the map at a y-value of 16.  This causes collisions with obstacles 1, 2, and 3.  We can avoid this problem by routing the path upwards around these obstacles. The revised path can then proceed left towards the goal.

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 7.2),
    (9.0, 19.87),

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
