# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[7.2, 18.1], [7.7, 15.8], [14.3, 10.2], [14.0, 16.7]]
			Obstacle 2: [[19.5, 5.7], [15.3, 9.0], [16.1, 6.6], [18.2, 5.7]]
			Obstacle 3: [[6.1, 17.9], [12.6, 15.3], [17.6, 15.7], [12.2, 16.9]]
			Obstacle 4: [[10.4, 2.8], [18.4, 4.4], [15.4, 9.7], [10.5, 14.2]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 6.34), (9.0, 19.86)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/21/2024 04:37:42 PM] Here is a possible path considering the provided data:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 6.34), # Pass through Breakpoint Set 1
    (10.0, 8.0), # Navigate around Obstacle 4
    (16.0, 12.0), # Move towards the goal, avoiding Obstacles 1 and 3
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(1.0, 1.0):** Starts within the start quadrilateral.
2. **(9.0, 6.34):** This waypoint takes the path through the first breakpoint, navigating between the obstacles.
3. **(10.0, 8.0):** This waypoint guides the path to start curving around Obstacle 4, maintaining a safe distance.
4. **(16.0, 12.0):**  Continuing the trajectory, this point allows the path to move further away from Obstacle 4 while also maneuvering around the left side of Obstacles 1 and 3.
5. **(19.0, 19.0):** Finally, this waypoint directs the path straight to the goal within the goal quadrilateral. 

This path avoids all obstacles with a safe margin and fulfills all the requirements. Remember that this is just one possible solution, and other paths may exist.

[08/21/2024 04:38:03 PM] The suggested path collides with obstacles 1 and 4. To circumvent this, we can adjust the path to navigate around these obstacles.  

Firstly, the path needs to move upwards to avoid obstacle 4. Then, to avoid obstacle 1, the path needs to move right before proceeding towards the goal.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start point
    (9.0, 6.34),  # Breakpoint
    (10.0, 16.0),  # Move upwards avoiding obstacle 4
    (16.0, 16.0),  # Move right, staying clear of obstacle 1 
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point
]
```

This new path addresses the collisions with obstacles 1 and 4 by first moving upward to y = 16 and then rightward. This ensures a clear path to the goal while still passing through the required breakpoint.

[08/21/2024 04:38:08 PM] The current path fails because the segment from the breakpoint to (10.0, 16.0) cuts through obstacle 1. We need to find a way around this obstacle. 

Instead of directly trying to go above obstacle 1, let's aim to go below it. 

From the breakpoint (9.0, 6.34), we can move rightwards, staying below obstacle 1 and obstacle 4. Once we are past obstacle 1, we can comfortably move upwards towards the goal.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   
    (9.0, 6.34),  
    (15.0, 6.0),  # Move rightwards, staying below obstacle 1

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:38:15 PM] The current path collides with Obstacle 4 because it attempts to move directly to the right after passing through the breakpoint.  Instead, the path needs to navigate above Obstacle 4. 

Here's a possible adjustment:

1. **Continue from the valid subpath:** We'll keep the first two waypoints of the path the same: `[(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 6.34)]`.
2. **Navigate above Obstacle 4:**  We'll add a waypoint above and to the right of Obstacle 4 to guide the path around it. A suitable waypoint could be `(12.0, 15.0)`.
3. **Proceed towards the goal:** From this new waypoint, we can safely move towards the goal set. We'll add another waypoint at `(16.0, 16.0)` to maintain a safe distance from obstacles.
4. **Reach the goal:** Finally, we'll connect to the goal set with the waypoint `(19.0, 19.0)`.

Therefore, the updated path is:

```
new_path = [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 6.34), (12.0, 15.0), (16.0, 16.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:38:21 PM] The path needs to navigate through a rather complex arrangement of obstacles. The initial segment towards the breakpoint (9.0, 6.34) is valid. However, the segment connecting this breakpoint to (12.0, 15.0) directly intersects both Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 4. 

To circumvent this, we can adjust the path to move above Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 4. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 6.34), # Pass through the breakpoint
    (9.0, 19.0), # Move upwards to a point above Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 4
    (16.0, 19.0), # Move rightwards, staying clear of the obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0) # Reach a point within the goal set
]
```

This path ensures a safe distance from all obstacles while successfully passing through a breakpoint and reaching the goal set.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:38:28 PM] The current path fails because the second segment crosses two obstacles. We need to adjust the path to go around these obstacles.

We can do this by adding waypoints that navigate around the right side of the obstacles.

Here is a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   
    (9.0, 6.34), 
    (14.5, 6.34),  
    (14.5, 19.0),  
    (19.0, 19.0)   
]
```

Here's the thought process behind these adjustments:

1. **Original path to breakpoint:** We keep the first two waypoints the same as they successfully navigate to the first breakpoint while avoiding obstacles.

2. **Navigating around obstacles:**  
    - Instead of going straight up, we move right to `(14.5, 6.34)`. This x-coordinate is chosen to be safely clear of Obstacle 1 and 4. 
    - From there, we move up to `(14.5, 19.0)`, staying clear of Obstacle 3.

3. **Reaching the goal:** Finally, we can move horizontally left to reach the goal point `(19.0, 19.0)`. 

This adjusted path avoids all obstacles while still passing through the required breakpoint and reaching the goal set.
