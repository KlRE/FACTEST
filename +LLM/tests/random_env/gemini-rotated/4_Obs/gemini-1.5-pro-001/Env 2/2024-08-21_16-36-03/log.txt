# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[17.8, 20.0], [11.9, 14.6], [14.3, 13.0], [16.2, 14.5]]
			Obstacle 2: [[17.5, 19.5], [5.5, 19.3], [9.2, 12.8], [9.6, 12.6]]
			Obstacle 3: [[7.3, 15.4], [8.3, 8.2], [11.4, 15.9], [9.9, 18.1]]
			Obstacle 4: [[15.3, 19.5], [17.3, 16.6], [17.4, 16.6], [17.4, 19.3]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 3.96), (9.0, 20.68)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:36:11 PM] Here is a possible path that avoids all obstacles and meets all the requirements:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 3.96),   # Pass through Breakpoint Set 1
    (10.0, 8.0),   # Navigate around Obstacle 3
    (13.0, 12.0),  # Move towards the goal while avoiding Obstacle 2
    (16.0, 17.0),  # Continue towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set
] 
```

**Explanation:**

* The path starts at (2.0, 1.0), which is inside the start set.
* It then moves to (9.0, 3.96), the first breakpoint, ensuring it passes through one breakpoint from the set.
* From there, the path navigates around Obstacle 3 by going to (10.0, 8.0).
* Continuing towards the goal, it reaches (13.0, 12.0), carefully avoiding Obstacle 2. 
* The path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles as it progresses to (16.0, 17.0).
* Finally, it arrives at (19.0, 19.0), a point safely within the goal set.

This path adheres to all given constraints, including starting and ending within the designated sets, passing through a breakpoint, and most importantly, avoiding any intersection with the obstacles.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:36:15 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid Obstacle 1. Looking at the valid subpath, a possible approach is to navigate around Obstacle 1 by going above it. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, 3.96), 
    (10.0, 8.0), 
    (10.0, 15.0), # move upwards to avoid obstacle 1
    (16.0, 17.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This path maintains the valid portion and adds a waypoint to move upwards, clearing Obstacle 1 before proceeding towards the goal.

]

[08/21/2024 04:36:23 PM] The path goes through obstacles 2 and 3. To avoid this, the path needs to be adjusted to go around these obstacles. 

There are two options:
1. Going above obstacles 2 and 3, then move right to the goal position.
2. Following the valid subpath, then going below obstacle 3, and finally move right to the goal position.

Let's explore both options:

**Option 1: Going above**

From the last valid waypoint (10.0, 8.0), move above obstacle 2 and 3.

new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, 3.96), 
    (10.0, 8.0), 
    (10.0, 21.0), # Go above obstacles
    (19.0, 21.0), # Move right
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Reach the goal 
]

**Option 2: Going below**

From the last valid waypoint (10.0, 8.0), move below obstacle 3, then move right to the goal position.

new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, 3.96), 
    (10.0, 8.0), 
    (10.0, 7.0), # Go below obstacle 3
    (19.0, 7.0), # Move right
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Reach the goal 
]

Both options provide a valid path.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:36:28 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with obstacles 2 and 3. It can be routed to pass between obstacles 1 and 4 instead.

new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0), # start in the start set
    (9.0, 3.96), # pass through the breakpoint
    (10.0, 8.0), # continue on a path towards the goal
    (13.0, 16.0), # navigate around obstacle 3, maintaining a safe distance

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 04:36:33 PM] The path intersects with two obstacles because the jump from (10.0, 8.0) to (13.0, 16.0) is too big. To fix this, we can add a waypoint in between to navigate around the obstacles. 

Observing the obstacles, there seems to be a clear path if we move right and upwards towards the goal position. Therefore, a suitable waypoint can be added around the top-right corner of Obstacle 2. 

new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, 3.96), 
    (10.0, 8.0),

[08/21/2024 04:37:01 PM] The provided path collides with obstacles because it attempts to move directly towards the goal without considering the obstacle positions. A better approach is to navigate around the obstacles by first moving towards Breakpoint Set 1, and then plotting a course to the goal set. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 3.96),  # Reach Breakpoint Set 1
    (9.0, 10.0),  # Move upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 2
    (13.0, 16.0), # Move right, staying clear of Obstacle 2
    (16.0, 17.0), # Continue towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Arrive within the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Initial Segment:** The path starts the same way as before, moving from inside the start set to the breakpoint.
2. **Navigating Obstacles:** Instead of directly heading towards the end goal, the path moves upwards after the breakpoint to avoid Obstacle 2.
3. **Approaching the Goal:** Once clear of Obstacle 2, the path moves right and slightly upwards, positioning itself for a clear path to the goal. 
4. **Final Approach:** The path continues towards the goal, remaining clear of all obstacles.

This adjusted path avoids collisions by strategically maneuvering around obstacles. Remember to always double-check the path against the obstacle coordinates to ensure a collision-free trajectory.
