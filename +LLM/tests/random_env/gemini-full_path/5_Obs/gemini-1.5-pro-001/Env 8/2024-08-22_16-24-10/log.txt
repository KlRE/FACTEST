# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[13.8, 19.6], [12.0, 16.1], [12.9, 15.9], [16.2, 17.1]]

[08/22/2024 04:24:23 PM] The initial path fails because it starts outside the start set and collides with multiple obstacles.  Let's devise a new path that navigates these obstacles successfully.

1. **Start Point:** We need to begin within the start set. A suitable starting point is (1.0, 1.0).

2. **Navigating Obstacles:**  Examining the obstacles, we can identify a path that weaves between them. 

3. **Avoiding Obstacle 3 and 4:** We need to move above obstacles 3 and 4.  A waypoint at (1.0, 17.0) achieves this. 

4. **Avoiding Obstacle 1:** To avoid obstacle 1, we need to move further right before proceeding horizontally.  Let's add a waypoint at (11.0, 17.0) to bypass obstacle 1.

5. **Reaching the Goal:** From (11.0, 17.0), we can move directly right to (17.5, 17.0) and then up to (17.5, 19.0), positioning us to enter the goal set.  

6. **Final Approach:** Finally, we can move to (19.0, 19.0) within the goal set.

**Therefore, the revised path is:**

```
new_path = [(1.0, 1.0), (1.0, 17.0), (11.0, 17.0), (17.5, 17.0), (17.5, 19.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

[08/22/2024 04:24:31 PM] The initial path goes through several obstacles. To fix this, the path needs to navigate around obstacles 1, 3, and 4 first, then proceed towards the goal.

- The path can first go vertically up to (1.0, 17.0) to avoid obstacles starting at the ground level.
- From (1.0, 17.0), the path needs to navigate to the right side of obstacles 3 and 4. A waypoint at (6.0, 19.0) can be added to guide the path above these obstacles. 
-  Next, the path needs to bypass obstacle 1. Adding a waypoint at (11.0, 19.0) allows the path to clear obstacle 1. 
- Now the path can move towards the goal, passing between obstacles 1 and 2. A waypoint at (17.0, 19.0) is added to guide this movement.
- Finally, the path can descend to the goal position at (19.0, 19.0).

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:24:50 PM] The original path was trying to take a straight line above the obstacles. However, obstacles 3 and 4 extend too far north to allow for this. The path needs to be adjusted to navigate between obstacles 3 and 1. 

Here's how I propose we fix the path:

1. **Starting Point:** We can keep the original starting point of (1.0, 1.0). 
2. **Navigate Upwards:** Continue moving upwards, similar to the original path, to a point above obstacle 3, for example (1.0, 17.0).
3. **Move Right, Between Obstacles:**  Carefully navigate a path rightwards, staying between the top of obstacle 3 and the left edge of obstacle 1. This might require a couple of waypoints to stay clear, for example:
    * (6.0, 17.0) - Move right, clear of obstacle 3
    * (11.0, 17.5) - Adjust slightly upwards to prepare for passing obstacle 1
4. **Continue to Goal:** From here, the path can safely continue rightwards past obstacle 1 and then upwards to reach the goal region, for example:
    * (17.0, 17.5)
    * (19.0, 19.0)

**New Path:**
```
new_path = [(1.0, 1.0), (1.0, 17.0), (6.0, 17.0), (11.0, 17.5), (17.0, 17.5), (19.0, 19.0)]

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

[08/22/2024 04:24:56 PM] The initial path goes right through obstacles 3 and 4. To avoid this, the path needs to be adjusted to navigate around these obstacles. 

1. **Starting Point:** The starting point (1.0, 1.0) is fine.
2. **Navigating Obstacles:** Obstacles 3 and 4 present a challenge as they create a narrow passage. 
    - Instead of going straight up to y=17, the path could first move right to a point between obstacles 4 and 5. 
    - Let's choose (10.0, 1.0) as the next waypoint.
3. **Reaching the Goal:** From (10.0, 1.0), the path can safely move upwards to bypass obstacle 1 and reach the goal set.
    - A suitable waypoint would be (10.0, 20.0) before finally reaching (19.0, 19.0).

[08/22/2024 04:25:04 PM] The initial path cuts through obstacles 3 and 4 because it goes straight up from (10.0, 1.0) to (10.0, 20.0). It also intersects obstacle 1 when moving from (10.0, 20.0) to (19.0, 19.0).

To avoid this, we can route the path around the left side of the obstacles:

1.  **From the start:** Keep the first waypoint at (1.0, 1.0).
2.  **Navigate below obstacles:** Move horizontally to a point left of all obstacles, for example, (1.0, 10.0). 
3.  **Move upwards:**  Proceed upwards to a point above all obstacles, for example (1.0, 21.0)
4.  **Head towards the goal:** Move horizontally towards the goal,  (19.0, 21.0).
5. **Reach the goal:** Finally, move down into the goal set, (19.0, 19.0).

This breakdown ensures we bypass all obstacles completely. 

**Here is the adjusted path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (1.0, 10.0),
    (1.0, 21.0),
    (19.0, 21.0),
