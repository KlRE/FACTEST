# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[0.6, 10.5], [8.1, 7.2], [13.4, 18.8], [0.8, 17.3]]

    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:27:36 PM] It seems like the obstacles are clustered in the middle-right section of the space between our start and goal. This suggests a path that initially moves upwards, navigating around the topmost obstacles, and then proceeds rightwards towards the goal. Here's a possible path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0),   # Start at the top edge of the start set
    (1.0, 12.0),  # Move straight up, staying clear of obstacles
    (16.0, 12.0), # Move right, staying above all obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move diagonally down into the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

* **(1.0, 2.0):**  We start at the top edge of the start square.
* **(1.0, 12.0):**  Moving directly upwards ensures we clear all the obstacles with y-coordinates lower than 12.0.
* **(16.0, 12.0):** We move right, staying above all obstacles.
* **(19.0, 19.0):** A final diagonal movement takes us into the goal set. 

**Important:** This is a visual estimation. It's crucial to verify this path with proper calculations or visualizations to guarantee it doesn't intersect any obstacle boundaries.

]

[08/22/2024 04:27:46 PM] The initial path was attempting to take a fairly direct route to the goal, but it ran into several obstacles along the way. 

Let's break down the path and navigate around the obstacles:

1. **Starting Point:** We can keep the starting point (1.0, 2.0) as it sits within the start set.

2. **Navigating Obstacles 1 and 2:**  
    - Obstacle 1 extends upwards (y-coordinate) significantly. A good strategy is to move horizontally first to avoid it entirely.  
    - Obstacle 2 sits to the right and slightly higher than Obstacle 1. To navigate around both, we need to move far enough right to be clear of Obstacle 2's leftmost point (x-coordinate 15.6). Let's aim for an x-coordinate of 16.0.
    - To avoid colliding with either obstacle while moving horizontally, we need to choose a y-coordinate that falls below Obstacle 1's lowest point (y-coordinate 7.2) and above Obstacle 2's highest point (y-coordinate 15.1). A y-coordinate of 6.0 should work well.
    - This gives us a new waypoint: (16.0, 6.0)

3. **Approaching the Goal:**
    - From (16.0, 6.0) we have a clear path to the goal. We can simply move upwards to the goal set.

4. **Final Waypoint:**  
    - We can choose a point within the goal set, such as (19.0, 19.0).

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0),   
    (16.0, 6.0),  
    (19.0, 19.0)   
]
```

This new path avoids all obstacles by navigating around them in a strategic manner.

[08/22/2024 04:28:03 PM] The original path attempts to move directly from (16.0, 1.0) to the goal set, colliding with obstacles 2, 3, and 5 in the process. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around these obstacles.

A viable strategy is to first move upwards, staying clear of obstacles 2 and 5, then proceed towards the goal from a higher y-coordinate. This could be achieved by adding a waypoint above obstacle 2, then heading towards the goal.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0), 
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (16.0, 1.0), 
    (16.0, 16.0),  # Move upwards, clearing obstacles 2 & 5
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Proceed to the goal
]
```

This new path avoids collisions by navigating around the problematic obstacles.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

[08/22/2024 04:28:12 PM] The initial path went through obstacles 2, 3, and 5. To fix this, we can make the following adjustments:

1. **From the start (1.0, 2.0):** Maintain a straight path to the right, avoiding the y-range of obstacles 1 and 4 (approximately y=7 to y=20).  We can set an intermediate waypoint at (9.0, 2.0).

2. **From (9.0, 2.0):**  We can now safely move upwards, staying clear of obstacle 2. A waypoint at (9.0, 14.0) positions us above obstacle 2.

3. **From (9.0, 14.0):** Continue moving right, aiming for a point between obstacles 2 and 3.  A waypoint at (14.0, 14.0) achieves this.

4. **From (14.0, 14.0):** We can now safely move upwards, bypassing obstacle 3.  A waypoint at (14.0, 17.0) positions us above obstacle 3.

5. **From (14.0, 17.0):** Finally, move right towards the goal set. The endpoint (19.0, 19.0) is a suitable target within the goal set.

**Therefore, a revised path that avoids obstacles is:**

```
new_path = [(1.0, 2.0), (9.0, 2.0), (9.0, 14.0), (14.0, 14.0), (14.0, 17.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

[08/22/2024 04:28:21 PM] The initial path goes right through the obstacles, so we need to find a way around. 

1. **Segment 1 (1.0, 2.0) to (9.0, 2.0):**  This segment is fine as it stays below obstacles 1 and 4.
2. **Segment 2 (9.0, 2.0) to (9.0, 14.0):** This segment cuts through obstacles 1 and 4. We need to navigate around these. 
3. **Segment 3 (9.0, 14.0) to (14.0, 14.0):** This segment also collides with obstacles 1 and 4.  
4. **Segment 4 (14.0, 14.0) to (14.0, 17.0):** This segment is clear of obstacles.
5. **Segment 5 (14.0, 17.0) to (19.0, 19.0):** This segment intersects obstacle 3 and needs rerouting.

**Here's a possible rerouting:**

- After the initial point (1.0, 2.0), move further right to (16.0, 2.0) to completely avoid obstacles 1 and 4.
-  Then move upwards to (16.0, 17.0), bypassing obstacles 1, 4, and staying clear of obstacle 5.
