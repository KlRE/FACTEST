# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[16.4, 19.0], [11.4, 16.2], [11.6, 13.8], [14.8, 13.6]]
			Obstacle 2: [[15.2, 18.8], [19.2, 11.5], [17.6, 16.7], [15.3, 18.9]]
			Obstacle 3: [[13.4, 19.7], [0.5, 11.3], [9.6, 7.4], [13.6, 12.7]]
			Obstacle 4: [[12.1, 10.3], [12.2, 6.6], [17.8, 11.8], [14.5, 11.9]]
			Obstacle 5: [[14.6, 18.6], [11.0, 15.8], [12.7, 8.1], [16.9, 6.4]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.

        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

]

[08/22/2024 04:31:28 PM] The initial path goes through Obstacle 3. To avoid this, we can adjust the path to go around this obstacle. 

1. **Starting Point:** Keep the starting point at (1.0, 1.0).
2. **Navigate Around Obstacle 3:**  
    * Move to the right, further away from Obstacle 3, towards a point like (15.0, 1.0). 
    * From there, move upwards to a point above Obstacle 3 and clear of Obstacles 4 and 5, such as (15.0, 15.0). 
3. **Approach the Goal:** 
    * Now, with a clear path, move left towards the goal position at (19.0, 20.0).

This strategy avoids all obstacles and maintains a safe distance.

**New Path:**
```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   
    (15.0, 1.0),  
    (15.0, 15.0),

[08/22/2024 04:31:35 PM] The initial path goes right through the obstacles. I will adjust it to navigate around them.

1. **From the start:** The initial segment of (1.0, 1.0) to (15.0, 1.0) goes too far to the right and directly into obstacles.  I'll redirect the path upwards to go around obstacle 4 and 5. 

2. **Navigating Obstacles:** To avoid obstacle 3, the path needs to go above it. Obstacles 1 and 2 present a narrow passage, requiring a careful path.

3. **Towards the Goal:** After clearing the obstacles, the path can head towards the goal. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start
    (1.0, 12.0),  # Move upwards, clearing obstacles 4 & 5
    (9.0, 12.0),  # Move right, staying below obstacle 3

    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:31:41 PM] The initial path goes right through obstacle 3. To avoid this, we can navigate around obstacle 3 by going above it. 

1. **Start:** Keep the starting point at (1.0, 1.0).
2. **Above Obstacle 3:** Move vertically upward to a point above obstacle 3, for example, (1.0, 14.0).
3. **Clear of Obstacles:** From there, move horizontally to the right, clearing all obstacles, for example, to the point (17.0, 14.0). 
4. **Reach Goal:**  Finally, move downwards to reach the goal set, for example, at (19.0, 19.0).

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (1.0, 14.0), 
    (17.0, 14.0),

[08/22/2024 04:32:08 PM] The initial path was trying to take a more or less straight route to the goal, but the obstacles are significantly blocking that path. We need to find a way around these obstacles.

Looking at the obstacles, there's a bit of space between obstacles 3 and 5.  We could try to thread the path through that space.  

Let's try this adjusted path:

1. **(1.0, 1.0):** Start at the bottom corner of the start set.
2. **(1.0, 7.0):** Move directly upwards, staying clear of obstacle 3.
3. **(12.0, 7.0):**  Move rightwards, going through the gap between obstacles 3 and 5. 
4. **(12.0, 20.0):** Move upwards, staying clear of obstacle 1.
5. **(19.0, 19.0):** Move right and slightly down to the goal set.

Therefore, the new path is:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (1.0, 7.0),
    (12.0, 7.0),
    (12.0, 20.0),

[08/22/2024 04:32:17 PM] The path needs to navigate around obstacles 1, 3, and 5 to reach the goal. Let's break down how to adjust the path:

1. **Initial Segment:** The first segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (1.0, 7.0) is safe and avoids all obstacles. 

2. **Avoiding Obstacles:**  Instead of going straight up to (12.0, 7.0), we need to steer clear of obstacles 3 and 5. 

    * We can achieve this by moving right towards obstacle 4 but staying a safe distance away. 
    * Let's add a waypoint at (8.0, 7.0). 

3. **Navigating Upwards:**  From (8.0, 7.0), we can move upwards towards the goal. 

    * To avoid obstacle 1, we need to stay to the left.  
    * A good waypoint would be around (8.0, 16.0). 

4. **Approaching the Goal:** From (8.0, 16.0), we are clear to move horizontally towards the goal, avoiding obstacle 2.  

5. **Final Segment:** A final waypoint at (19.0, 16.0) allows us to move directly into the goal set.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
