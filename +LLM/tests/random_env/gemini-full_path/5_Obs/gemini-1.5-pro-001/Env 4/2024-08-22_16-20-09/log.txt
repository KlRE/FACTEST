# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[12.1, 17.4], [10.1, 14.5], [10.5, 9.0], [13.0, 11.2]]
			Obstacle 2: [[18.9, 14.9], [15.9, 17.3], [16.3, 14.9], [18.7, 13.9]]
			Obstacle 3: [[3.0, 11.4], [15.0, 16.2], [10.6, 17.1], [3.8, 16.6]]
			Obstacle 4: [[12.6, 14.2], [17.3, 3.3], [15.5, 9.7], [14.5, 11.9]]
			Obstacle 5: [[19.9, 1.7], [16.3, 7.4], [16.8, 6.1], [19.2, 2.5]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:20:16 PM] The provided obstacles create a somewhat complex environment, but by analyzing their positions, we can find a safe path. 

1. **Starting Point:** We can start from the top-left corner of the start set: (0.0, 2.0).

2. **Navigating Obstacles:**
    -  Initially, move upwards to (0.0, 17.0) staying clear of Obstacle 3. 
    -  Then, move right towards (17.0, 17.0), navigating between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2.
    -  Finally, move down to (19.0, 19.0), safely within the goal set.

3. **Endpoint:** This brings us within the goal set.

Therefore, a possible path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 2.0),   
    (0.0, 17.0),  
    (17.0, 17.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)   
]
```

**Important Note:** This path avoids direct contact with the obstacles based on their given coordinates. However, it is always recommended to have a safety margin in real-world scenarios due to potential inaccuracies in measurements or robot control.

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:20:23 PM] The initial path goes directly to the right at a y-coordinate of 17.  This causes it to intersect with obstacles 1, 2, and 3. To avoid these obstacles, we need to route the path around them. 

First, we can move upward, going above obstacle 1 and 3. Looking at their y-coordinates, we see that a y-coordinate of 17.5 will be above these obstacles.

Next, we can proceed rightward, aiming to pass between obstacles 2 and 3.  Obstacle 2's leftmost point has an x-coordinate of 15.9, and obstacle 3's rightmost point has an x-coordinate of 15.0. Therefore, an x-coordinate of 15.5 will allow us to pass safely between these obstacles.

Finally, we can proceed to the goal position.

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 2.0),   # Start Point
    (0.0, 17.5),  # Move above obstacles 1 and 3
    (15.5, 17.5), # Move right between obstacles 2 and 3 
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Goal Point 
]
```
