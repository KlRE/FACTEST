# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[13.5, 19.5], [11.6, 17.4], [12.2, 17.0], [14.2, 17.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[15.7, 15.4], [19.8, 10.5], [19.3, 12.9], [17.9, 16.5]]
			Obstacle 3: [[10.7, 18.1], [16.1, 15.8], [19.6, 17.6], [11.7, 19.4]]
			Obstacle 4: [[6.5, 18.1], [8.5, 18.2], [10.3, 18.9], [8.5, 18.6]]
			Obstacle 5: [[11.6, 17.0], [17.6, 11.1], [19.4, 15.1], [15.1, 18.1]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:16:17 PM] The path planning can be visualized in two stages:

1. **Navigating to a safe passage:** Starting within the start quadrilateral, the path needs to maneuver around obstacles 1, 4, and a portion of obstacle 5 to reach a relatively obstacle-free region. 

2. **Approaching the goal:** Once past the initial cluster of obstacles, the path can proceed towards the goal quadrilateral, making minor adjustments to avoid obstacle 2.

Based on this understanding, a possible path is:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start within the start quadrilateral
    (5.0, 1.0),      # Move right, staying clear of obstacles 4 and 5
    (5.0, 16.0),     # Move upwards, avoiding obstacle 1
    (10.0, 16.0),    # Move right, staying below obstacles 3 and 5 
    (17.0, 17.0),    # Navigate diagonally upwards, avoiding obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)     # Reach a point within the goal quadrilateral 
]
```

**Important Note:** This proposed path is a visual estimation based on the provided coordinates. It's crucial to verify this path using a computational method or graphical representation to guarantee it doesn't intersect with any obstacle and maintains a safe distance.

[08/22/2024 04:16:24 PM] The initial path was colliding with obstacles 3 and 5. To avoid this, we can adjust the path by navigating around these obstacles. 

1. **Starting Point:** We keep the starting point at (1.0, 1.0).
2. **Navigating around Obstacle 5:**  Instead of going straight up, we can guide the path east, maneuvering around the lower tip of Obstacle 5.  A waypoint at (8.0, 1.0) would achieve this.
3. **Towards the Goal:** From there, we can move north, setting a waypoint at (8.0, 16.0) to clear Obstacle 3. 
4. **Approaching the Goal:**  We can then proceed east towards the goal with a waypoint at (17.0, 16.0) and finally (19.0, 19.0) to reach the goal area. 

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [

[08/22/2024 04:16:32 PM] The original path goes right through Obstacles 2, 3, and 5.  We need to adjust the path to navigate around these obstacles.

- The path can initially proceed as planned to (8.0, 1.0). 
- From there, to avoid obstacles 2 and 5, the path needs to move upward before x = 11.6 (the leftmost point of obstacle 5). 
- We can set a waypoint at (8.0, 17.0), safely navigating above obstacles 2 and 5.
- The path can then proceed horizontally to the right, aiming for a point between obstacles 3 and 5. A safe waypoint is (12.0, 17.0).
-  Next, the path can move upwards to avoid obstacle 3, with a waypoint at (12.0, 19.0). 
-  Finally, the path can proceed horizontally to reach the goal set, for example, at (19.0, 19.0).

Here is the adjusted path:

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:16:38 PM] The initial path attempts to navigate above obstacles 1 and 3, but intersects with them. A more effective approach is to go below these obstacles. 

- From the start point, the path can move horizontally to the right, staying below obstacle 4. 
- Once past obstacle 4, the path can move vertically upwards, passing between obstacles 2 and 5. 
- Finally, after clearing obstacle 2, the path can proceed horizontally to the goal.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   // Start within the start set
    (8.0, 1.0),   // Move right, staying below obstacle 4
    (8.0, 13.0),  // Move upwards, passing between obstacles 2 and 5 
    (19.0, 13.0), // Move right, towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)  // End within the goal set

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:16:46 PM] The original path attempts to move horizontally across the environment, which leads to collisions with obstacles 2, 3, and 5.  We need to find a path that navigates around these obstacles. 

Observing the environment, we see that obstacle 4 is relatively isolated on the left side of the environment. We can leverage this by first moving upwards, navigating around the top of obstacle 4, then proceeding right towards the goal. This strategy should allow us to avoid the cluster of obstacles 2, 3, and 5.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start point 
    (1.0, 10.0), # Move upwards, clearing obstacle 4
    (8.0, 10.0), # Move right, staying clear of obstacle 4 
    (8.0, 22.0), # Move upwards, clearing all obstacles 
    (19.0, 22.0), # Move right, staying clear of obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End point
]
```

This path first moves vertically to avoid obstacle 4, then travels right at a safe distance above obstacles 2, 3, and 5 before finally descending to the goal.

[08/22/2024 04:17:12 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid Obstacle 4. Since the segment between (8.0, 10.0) and (8.0, 22.0) crosses the obstacle, we can add waypoints to navigate around it.

Analyzing Obstacle 4, we see it occupies a space roughly between x-coordinates 6.5 and 10.3 and y-coordinates 18.1 and 18.9.  

Therefore, we can modify the path to go around Obstacle 4 by first moving right towards x-coordinate 11.0, then upwards to clear the obstacle. 

Here is the adjusted path:
