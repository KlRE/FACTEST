# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.9, 16.0], [18.1, 15.3], [19.2, 17.6], [17.6, 17.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[15.7, 15.5], [16.5, 7.0], [19.0, 16.8], [18.2, 16.7]]
			Obstacle 3: [[6.0, 13.8], [1.1, 10.5], [9.8, 1.4], [14.2, 3.9]]
			Obstacle 4: [[7.3, 17.0], [10.5, 10.6], [17.0, 7.3], [10.3, 16.6]]
			Obstacle 5: [[2.6, 10.7], [13.7, 13.3], [14.8, 16.7], [5.9, 13.7]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.

    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:18:23 PM] A viable path can be visualized by imagining a diagonal line from the start to the goal. This line appears to pass between several obstacles but doesn't intersect any. To ensure ample clearance, the path will be adjusted slightly.

Here's a possible path with waypoints:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (5.0, 4.0),    # Navigating towards the gap between Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 5
    (8.0, 7.0),    # Continuing through the gap, maintaining distance from obstacles
    (12.0, 10.0),   # Approaching the gap between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2 
    (16.0, 13.0),  # Passing through the gap between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Arriving at the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation:**

* The path starts at (2.0, 1.0), which is inside the start set.
* It then navigates diagonally towards the goal, carefully chosen to maintain a safe distance from the obstacles.
* The waypoints guide the path through the gaps between the obstacles: 
    * Between Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 5.
    * Between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2.
* Finally, the path reaches (19.0, 19.0), which is within the goal set. 

**Important:** This proposed path is a visual estimation. It's crucial to mathematically verify the distances between the path segments and the obstacles to guarantee no collisions.

[08/22/2024 04:18:31 PM] The original path failed to avoid several obstacles.  I will adjust the path to navigate around the obstacles safely. 

1. **Starting Point:** The start point (2.0, 1.0) is fine.
2. **Navigating Obstacles 3 and 5:** To avoid these obstacles, the path needs to go south first, then head east.  Let's add a waypoint at (2.0, -1.0) to achieve this.
3. **Avoiding Obstacle 4:** The path needs to stay below Obstacle 4. We can route it to the east  while staying south of the obstacle. Let's add a waypoint at (10.0, -1.0).
4. **Clear of Obstacles 2 and 1:** From (10.0, -1.0), we can safely move east and then north to avoid obstacles 2 and 1. A waypoint at (17.0, 10.0) will help guide the path.
5. **Reaching the Goal:**  Finally, we can move towards the goal point (19.0, 19.0) from (17.0, 10.0) without encountering any obstacles.

Therefore, the revised path is:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0), 
    (2.0, -1.0), 
    (10.0, -1.0),
    (17.0, 10.0),

[08/22/2024 04:18:40 PM] The initial path goes directly through obstacles, so adjustments need to be made. Let's break down the path and navigate around the obstacles:

1. **Starting Point:** (2.0, 1.0) - This is fine, as it lies within the start set.

2. **Navigating Obstacles:** The path needs to safely reach the goal set (around x=20, y=20). The main challenge is to find a way around Obstacles 1, 2, 3, and 4. 

   *  Instead of going down immediately, let's try going further right, aiming for a point with x-coordinate 10.0 and a y-coordinate above Obstacle 3 and 5. Looking at the coordinates, a y-coordinate of 15.0 seems safe. 
   * Next, let's aim for a point to the right, passing above Obstacle 2. A point with an x-coordinate of 17.0 and a y-coordinate of 16.0 seems suitable. 
   * From there, we can proceed safely to the goal set.

3. **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, the path can reach the goal set. Let's pick (19.0, 19.0) as our endpoint.

Therefore, a revised path that avoids obstacles is:

```
new_path = [

{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:18:47 PM] The initial path goes through several obstacles. To correct this, we need to strategically add waypoints to navigate around them.

1. **Starting Point:** The given starting point (2.0, 1.0) is good.

2. **Navigating Obstacles 3 and 5:** To avoid these obstacles, we can guide the path upwards, staying close to the left edge of the environment. A waypoint at (2.0, 8.0) would be suitable.

3. **Avoiding Obstacle 4:** From (2.0, 8.0), we need to move right, passing between Obstacles 4 and 5. A waypoint at (6.0, 9.0) seems safe.

4. **Maneuvering Around Obstacle 2:**  We need to go further right and up to avoid the bottom vertex of Obstacle 2. Let's add a waypoint at (14.0, 14.0).

5. **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, we can move directly to the goal set. 

Therefore, a corrected path is:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0), 
    (2.0, 8.0), 
    (6.0, 9.0),
    (14.0, 14.0),

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

[08/22/2024 04:18:55 PM] The initial path goes through several obstacles. To fix this, let's analyze the environment and plan a path around the obstacles:

1. **Start to Safe Zone:**  The first part of the path goes from the start set to a point above obstacle 3. A suitable point for this is (2.0, 12.0). This ensures a clear path above the obstacle.
2. **Navigating Obstacles:** Next, the path needs to navigate around obstacles 4 and 5. One safe route is to go further left before moving right, passing above obstacle 5. Suitable waypoints for this are (2.0, 14.0) and (6.0, 14.0).
3. **Approaching the Goal:** From there, the path can move towards the goal, staying clear of obstacles 1 and 2.  A good point to aim for before the final stretch is (16.0, 19.0), which is just below obstacle 1.
4. **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, the path can move directly into the goal set.

Based on this analysis, the updated path is:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0),   # Start point
    (2.0, 12.0),  # Move above obstacle 3
    (2.0, 14.0),   # Move left above obstacle 5
    (6.0, 14.0),   # Continue right above obstacle 5
    (16.0, 19.0),  # Approach the goal, staying below obstacle 1

[08/22/2024 04:19:07 PM] The initial path goes through obstacles 3 and 4. To fix this, we can make the following adjustments:

1. **Avoiding Obstacle 3:** Instead of going straight up from the start point, we can navigate around Obstacle 3 by moving to the right. A waypoint at (10.0, 1.0) would allow us to clear Obstacle 3. 

2. **Avoiding Obstacle 4:**  After clearing Obstacle 3, we need to avoid Obstacle 4. We can add a waypoint above Obstacle 4 at (10.0, 18.0). This will allow us to go around it safely.

3. **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, we can proceed towards the goal set from the waypoint above Obstacle 4.

Therefore, the updated path is:

```
