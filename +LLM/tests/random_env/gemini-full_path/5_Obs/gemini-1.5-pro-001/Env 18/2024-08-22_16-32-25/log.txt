# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[18.9, 14.1], [18.4, 6.0], [19.3, 8.5], [19.9, 10.6]]
			Obstacle 2: [[15.1, 14.1], [18.6, 16.8], [16.7, 16.7], [16.1, 15.9]]

[08/22/2024 04:32:35 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid Obstacle 5.  We can do this by going around Obstacle 5 on the left side.

1. **Original path:** The problematic segment goes directly upwards from (14.0, 10.0) to (14.0, 19.0).
2. **Identifying the issue:** This segment intersects Obstacle 5 because Obstacle 5 lies to the right of the line x=14 between y=10 and y=19.
3. **Solution:**  We can guide the path around Obstacle 5 by first moving left before going up.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.5), 
    (1.0, 10.0), 
    (8.0, 10.0),  # Move left before encountering Obstacle 5 
    (8.0, 19.0),  # Now move upwards, clear of Obstacle 5
    (19.0, 19.0)

[08/22/2024 04:32:42 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid Obstacle 4. One solution is to add a waypoint to the right of Obstacle 4, allowing the path to go around it.

**New Path:**
```
new_path = [(1.0, 1.5), (1.0, 10.0), (14.0, 10.0), (14.0, 19.0), (19.0, 19.0)]
```

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Identify the Problem:** The original path intersects with Obstacle 4 because it attempts to go directly upwards at x=8.0.
2. **Analyze the Surroundings:** Observe that there's open space to the right of Obstacle 4.
3. **Find a Safe Passage:** Instead of moving straight up, the path can move to the right first, clearing Obstacle 4.
4. **Add Waypoints:** Introduce two new waypoints:
    *  `(14.0, 10.0)`: Moves rightwards, clearing Obstacle 4.
    *  `(14.0, 19.0)`: Moves upwards from a safe distance to align with the goal set.
5. **Connect to the Goal:** The final segment now connects to the goal set without crossing any obstacles.

[08/22/2024 04:33:11 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid obstacle 5. To do this, we can route the path around the left side of obstacle 5. 

Here's the updated path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.5),   # Start within the start set
    (1.0, 10.0),  # Move upward, clearing the starting area
    (8.0, 10.0),  # Move left, giving a wide berth to obstacle 5 
    (8.0, 19.0),  # Move upward, safely past obstacle 5
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Move right to the goal within the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(1.0, 1.5) to (1.0, 10.0):** This segment remains unchanged, moving vertically upward from the starting point.
2. **(1.0, 10.0) to (8.0, 10.0):**  Instead of going directly towards the goal, we move left. This maneuver creates a safe distance from obstacle 5.
3. **(8.0, 10.0) to (8.0, 19.0):**  We move upwards, well clear of the left side of obstacle 5. 
4. **(8.0, 19.0) to (19.0, 19.0):** Finally, we move right towards the goal, encountering no further obstacles.

This adjusted path ensures a safe passage around obstacle 5 while still reaching the goal.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[18.9, 14.1], [18.4, 6.0], [19.3, 8.5], [19.9, 10.6]]
			Obstacle 2: [[15.1, 14.1], [18.6, 16.8], [16.7, 16.7], [16.1, 15.9]]
			Obstacle 3: [[15.3, 8.8], [16.7, 1.6], [18.1, 10.4], [17.6, 11.1]]
			Obstacle 4: [[8.8, 18.5], [1.1, 15.1], [6.6, 10.2], [13.1, 13.3]]
			Obstacle 5: [[10.3, 17.4], [17.1, 8.2], [17.9, 8.9], [16.2, 14.7]]

    
## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.0, 1.5), (1.0, 10.0), (8.0, 10.0), (8.0, 19.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    Obstacle Avoidance (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
		Segment 3 between points (8.0, 10.0) and (8.0, 19.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 4: [[8.8, 18.5], [1.1, 15.1], [6.6, 10.2], [13.1, 13.3]]
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:33:18 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid Obstacle 4. To achieve this, we can modify the path to go around Obstacle 4 on the right side. 

Here's how we can adjust the path:

1. **Keep the first two waypoints:**  The first two waypoints, (1.0, 1.5) and (1.0, 10.0), are fine as they are.

2. **Navigate around Obstacle 4:** Instead of going straight up to (8.0, 10.0), we need to go right first, then up, and then left to clear Obstacle 4. Here's a possible adjustment:
    - Move right to x-coordinate 14.0: (14.0, 10.0)
    - Move up to y-coordinate 19.0: (14.0, 19.0) 

3. **Keep the last waypoint:** The last waypoint (19.0, 19.0) is already in a good position to reach the goal set.

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [(1.0, 1.5), (1.0, 10.0), (14.0, 10.0), (14.0, 19.0), (19.0, 19.0)]
```
