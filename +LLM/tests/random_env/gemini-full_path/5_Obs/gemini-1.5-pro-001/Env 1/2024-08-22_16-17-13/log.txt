# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[17.9, 17.4], [12.4, 19.7], [13.1, 15.8], [13.3, 15.5]]

]

[08/22/2024 04:17:25 PM] The initial path attempts to navigate directly to the goal, but runs into issues with Obstacles 3, 4, and 1. To correct this, we need to strategize a path that weaves around these obstacles.

1. **Starting Point:** (1.0, 1.0) - This remains unchanged as it sits within the start set.
2. **Maneuvering around Obstacles 4 and 3:** Instead of moving directly upwards, we can guide the path to the right, steering clear of Obstacles 4 and 3. A suitable waypoint would be (10.0, 8.0). 
3. **Approaching the Goal:** From (10.0, 8.0), we can plot a course upwards, bypassing Obstacle 5 to reach (10.0, 16.0).
4. **Navigating to the Goal Set:** Finally, we can move rightwards towards the goal set, aiming for a point within the set, such as (19.0, 19.0). 

Therefore, the adjusted path, taking into account the obstacles, is as follows:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (10.0, 8.0), 
    (10.0, 16.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)

]

[08/22/2024 04:17:32 PM] The initial path has collisions because it tries to move directly upwards and then rightwards, crossing the paths of multiple obstacles.  We can adjust the path by navigating around the obstacles in a way that minimizes the changes in direction.

1. **Starting Point:** We can keep the starting point at (1.0, 1.0).

2. **Maneuvering Obstacles:** Instead of directly going up, we can first move right, staying clear of Obstacle 4. A good waypoint for this would be (8.0, 1.0).  

3. **Heading Upwards:** From (8.0, 1.0), we can safely move upwards to a point above Obstacle 5 and below Obstacle 1. A suitable waypoint would be (8.0, 17.0).

4. **Approaching the Goal:** Finally, from (8.0, 17.0), we can move rightwards towards the goal, avoiding any further obstacles.  

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (8.0, 1.0), 
    (8.0, 17.0),

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:17:39 PM] The initial path has collisions because it goes directly upwards, intersecting with obstacles 3 and 4. Then, it attempts to move directly towards the goal, causing it to intersect with obstacles 1 and 3.

To fix this, we can navigate around the obstacles strategically:

1. **From the start:**  Instead of moving straight up, we can guide the path to the right side of the obstacles.
2. **Around obstacle cluster:** We can move the path upwards, going around the right side of obstacles 3 and 4.
3. **Towards the goal:** After safely navigating the obstacle cluster, the path can head directly towards the goal.

Here's a possible revised path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (8.0, 1.0),    # Move right, staying clear of the obstacle cluster
    (8.0, 10.0),   # Move upwards, passing below obstacle 2
    (17.0, 10.0),  # Move right, staying below obstacles 1 and 5
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move up to the goal position 
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles by navigating around the right side of the clustered obstacles.

[08/22/2024 04:17:44 PM] The path intersects with obstacle 5 because it attempts to move diagonally across the environment without considering the obstacle's position. To avoid this, we need to reroute the path. 

Instead of moving diagonally directly to the goal, let's try moving to the right, navigating below obstacle 5, and then proceeding towards the goal.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start point
    (8.0, 1.0),  # Move right
    (8.0, 8.0),  # Move down, staying below obstacle 5
    (17.0, 8.0), # Move right 
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Move up to the goal 
]
```

This path avoids obstacle 5 by going around it, first moving right, then down, and finally up to the goal.

[08/22/2024 04:18:14 PM] The provided path collides with obstacles 2 and 5. To circumvent these obstacles, we need to adjust the path's trajectory.

Firstly, the segment connecting (8.0, 8.0) and (17.0, 8.0) directly clashes with Obstacle 2. We need to route the path above this obstacle.

Secondly, the segment between (17.0, 8.0) and (19.0, 19.0) intersects both Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 5. This necessitates navigating around these obstacles, potentially by ascending above Obstacle 2 before approaching the goal.

Therefore, a revised path could involve the following adjustments:

1. **Maintain the initial segment:** (1.0, 1.0) to (8.0, 1.0)

2. **Ascend above Obstacle 2:** Introduce a waypoint above Obstacle 2, such as (8.0, 12.0).

3. **Proceed towards the goal:** Connect to a point beyond Obstacle 2 and below Obstacle 5, like (16.0, 12.0), and then (16.0, 19.0).

4. **Reach the goal:** Conclude the path at (19.0, 19.0) within the goal set.

Thus, a potential improved path is:

```
new_path = [(1.0, 1.0), (8.0, 1.0), (8.0, 12.0), (16.0, 12.0), (16.0, 19.0), (19.0, 19.0)]
```

This revised path attempts to navigate above Obstacle 2 and proceed towards the goal without intersecting any obstacles. However, it's crucial to verify this new path against the precise obstacle coordinates to guarantee a collision-free route. Further adjustments might be required upon closer examination.
