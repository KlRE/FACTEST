# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[18.6, 17.6], [15.8, 17.7], [16.5, 9.7], [18.4, 5.5]]
			Obstacle 2: [[10.1, 17.4], [11.0, 15.2], [18.0, 16.7], [15.6, 18.5]]
			Obstacle 3: [[0.8, 11.4], [9.6, 10.5], [10.4, 11.4], [6.1, 11.8]]
			Obstacle 4: [[11.8, 19.4], [13.9, 10.1], [18.7, 13.5], [14.6, 17.1]]
			Obstacle 5: [[15.4, 8.7], [17.8, 0.2], [19.8, 9.0], [19.7, 13.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.

    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:28:31 PM] The path needs to navigate from the bottom left to the top right of the environment while avoiding all obstacles. Here's a possible path considering the gaps and positions of the obstacles:

1. **Start:** The path can begin within the start set. Let's choose (1.0, 1.0) for the starting point.
2. **Moving Upwards:**  It can then move upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 3, aiming to go towards a space between Obstacles 2 and 4. A waypoint at (1.0, 14.0) could be suitable.
3. **Navigating Between Obstacles:** From this point, the path needs to carefully navigate between Obstacles 2 and 4. A waypoint at (12.0, 14.0) seems appropriate. 
4. **Avoiding Obstacle 1:** Now, the path needs to avoid Obstacle 1. It can do this by moving further up and right. A waypoint at (16.0, 18.0) appears safe.
5. **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, the path can move to the goal set. The point (19.0, 19.0) lies comfortably within the goal set.

Therefore, a possible path is:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (1.0, 14.0), 
    (12.0, 14.0), 
    (16.0, 18.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

**Important:** This is just a visual estimation. It is crucial to mathematically verify that the proposed path and the line segments connecting the waypoints do not intersect any of the obstacles.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:28:40 PM] The initial path has several intersections with the obstacles. Let's analyze each problematic segment and find alternative routes:

1. **Segment 1 ((1.0, 1.0) to (1.0, 14.0))**: This segment directly intersects Obstacle 3. To avoid this, we can move to the right of Obstacle 3. 
2. **Segment 3 ((12.0, 14.0) to (16.0, 18.0))**: This segment intersects both Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 4. A possible solution is to navigate above these obstacles.
3. **Segment 4 ((16.0, 18.0) to (19.0, 19.0))**: This segment intersects the top edge of Obstacle 2. We can avoid this by approaching the goal from a point already above Obstacle 2.

Considering these adjustments, a possible path is:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start
    (10.0, 1.0),  # Move right, staying below Obstacle 3
    (10.0, 20.0), # Move straight up, clearing all obstacles
    (19.0, 20.0)   # Move right to the goal
]
```

This path avoids all known obstacles and stays within the specified start and goal sets.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (10.0, 1.0),  # Move right
    (12.0, 1.0),  # Move further right, clearing Obstacle 3
    (12.0, 20.0), # Move upwards, now clear of all obstacles 
    (19.0, 20.0)   # Move right to the goal within the goal set
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles by first moving to the right, clearing Obstacle 3, and then moving upwards to the goal.

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:28:53 PM] The initial path went straight up from (12.0, 1.0) to (12.0, 20.0), directly through obstacles 2 and 4. To correct this, the path needs to navigate around these obstacles.

1. **Navigate around Obstacle 2:** Instead of going straight up, the path can move rightwards towards the right edge of obstacle 2 before proceeding upwards. This avoids intersection.

2. **Navigate around Obstacle 4:** After clearing obstacle 2, the path can continue upwards to a point above obstacle 4. Then, it can proceed leftwards to a point where it has a clear path to the goal set.

Here's a possible modified path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (10.0, 1.0),  # Initial rightward movement 
    (16.0, 1.0),  # Continue right to clear obstacle 2
    (16.0, 18.0), # Move upwards, clearing obstacle 2
    (17.0, 18.0), # Move right to avoid obstacle 4 while maintaining clearance 
    (19.0, 20.0)   # Move to the goal within the goal set
]
```

This new path attempts to avoid the obstacles by going around them while maintaining a safe distance.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.

[08/22/2024 04:28:59 PM] The initial path went directly upwards from (16.0, 1.0) to (16.0, 18.0), colliding with several obstacles. To correct this, we should navigate around the obstacles by utilizing a path that goes above them.

First, the path should move to the right, away from the obstacles clustered on the right side of the environment. Then, it can safely proceed upwards, avoiding all obstacles. Finally, it can move towards the goal position.

Here's a possible corrected path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start point
    (10.0, 1.0), # Move right
    (10.0, 20.0), # Move upwards, clear of all obstacles

[08/22/2024 04:29:06 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid Obstacle 3. To do this, we can route the path around the left side of the obstacle. 

1. **Maintain the start point:** (1.0, 1.0) is a valid starting point.
2. **Navigate around Obstacle 3:** Instead of going straight up from the starting point, move left to a point like (1.0, 8.0) to clear Obstacle 3.
3. **Proceed horizontally:**  Continue horizontally to the right, passing above Obstacle 3 with a waypoint like (10.0, 8.0).
4. **Move to the final destination:**  From there, move upward to (10.0, 20.0) and then right to the final destination (19.0, 20.0). 

This approach avoids all obstacles while staying within the defined start and goal sets.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (1.0, 8.0),
