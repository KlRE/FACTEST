# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[13.4, 18.9], [5.6, 19.2], [6.7, 13.9], [9.3, 13.3]]
			Obstacle 2: [[13.8, 17.2], [15.1, 15.3], [16.1, 19.2], [15.4, 19.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[9.4, 15.1], [15.5, 10.6], [19.9, 15.5], [19.5, 15.8]]
			Obstacle 4: [[5.4, 18.0], [7.6, 15.1], [12.7, 19.4], [7.3, 18.6]]
			Obstacle 5: [[10.4, 15.4], [15.0, 16.6], [15.3, 18.5], [11.4, 17.2]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.

## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:19:13 PM] The path can be planned by initially moving upwards, navigating around the cluster of obstacles, and then finally heading towards the goal.

1. **Start:** Begin at the top edge of the start set, (1.0, 2.0). 
2. **Up and Around:** Move upwards to (1.0, 19.0), safely above obstacles 1, 2, 4, and 5. 
3. **Navigate Right:** Proceed rightwards to (17.0, 19.0), clear of obstacle 3.
4. **Descend to Goal:** Finally, move down to (19.0, 19.0) within the goal set.

This results in the following path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0),
    (1.0, 19.0),
    (17.0, 19.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:19:19 PM] The initial path attempted to take a straight line across the top, but ran into obstacles 1, 2, and 4.  To avoid this, the path needs to dip down below these obstacles before heading towards the goal. 

Here's a possible revised path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0),    # Start within the start set
    (1.0, 10.0),   # Move down to avoid the upper cluster of obstacles
    (17.0, 10.0),  # Move right, staying clear of the obstacles 
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move up to the goal position 
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Downward Movement:** The path first moves down to a y-coordinate of 10. This safely bypasses obstacles 1, 2, and 4, which are all clustered near the top. 

2. **Lateral Movement:**  The path then moves right towards the goal, maintaining a y-coordinate of 10. This ensures it remains clear of the obstacle cluster.

3. **Upward Movement:** Finally, the path moves directly upwards to reach the goal position.

[08/22/2024 04:19:26 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid Obstacle 3.  I will add a waypoint to route the path around the right side of the obstacle.

**Chain of Thought**

1. **Original Issue:** The line segment from (17.0, 10.0) to (19.0, 19.0) cuts through Obstacle 3. 
2. **Solution:** To avoid this, the path needs to go around Obstacle 3. Since the goal is to the right, routing the path to the right of Obstacle 3 makes more sense.
3. **New Waypoint:** A new waypoint needs to be placed to the right of and above Obstacle 3 to guide the path around it. A suitable waypoint could be (20.0, 16.0), which is to the right of Obstacle 3 and still within the goal set.

**New Path:**

```

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:19:33 PM] The path intersects Obstacle 3 because it attempts to move directly towards the goal set. To avoid this, we need to navigate around the obstacles.

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Initial Path:** The original path's first two waypoints are fine:  (1.0, 2.0) and (1.0, 10.0). 

2. **Navigating Obstacles:** Instead of going directly to (17.0, 10.0), we need to go around Obstacle 3. A safe bet would be to go to the right. Let's add a waypoint at (17.0, 8.0). This keeps us below the lowest point of Obstacle 3.

3. **Reaching the Goal:** From (17.0, 8.0), we can move upwards to (17.0, 16.0) to avoid the rightmost point of Obstacle 3 and then proceed to the goal set with the original final waypoints (20.0, 16.0) and (19.0, 19.0).

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [(1.0, 2.0), (1.0, 10.0), (17.0, 8.0), (17.0, 16.0), (20.0, 16.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[13.4, 18.9], [5.6, 19.2], [6.7, 13.9], [9.3, 13.3]]
			Obstacle 2: [[13.8, 17.2], [15.1, 15.3], [16.1, 19.2], [15.4, 19.0]]

    Obstacle Avoidance (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
		Segment 3 between points (17.0, 8.0) and (17.0, 16.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 3: [[9.4, 15.1], [15.5, 10.6], [19.9, 15.5], [19.5, 15.8]]
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:19:40 PM] The path intersects with Obstacle 3 because it attempts to go straight up, directly through the obstacle. To avoid this, we can route the path around the left side of Obstacle 3.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0),   # Start within the start set
    (1.0, 10.0),  # Move upwards, clearing the top of Obstacle 4
    (8.0, 10.0),  # Move right, staying clear of Obstacle 3
    (8.0, 16.0), # Move upward, passing to the left of Obstacle 3
    (17.0, 16.0), # Move right towards the goal
    (20.0, 16.0), # Move into the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Final point within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **(8.0, 10.0):**  This waypoint is added to guide the path around the left side of Obstacle 3. 
2. **(8.0, 16.0):** This waypoint continues the path upwards, ensuring it stays clear of Obstacle 3. 

This new path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles while successfully connecting the start and goal sets.

[08/22/2024 04:20:09 PM] The initial path goes right into a cluster of obstacles. It's better to navigate around them. Looking at the obstacle placement, we can identify a safer corridor to the right of obstacles 1, 2, 4, and 5.  

Here's how we can adjust the path:

1. **Start:**  Keep the start point at (1.0, 2.0).
2. **Initial Rightward Movement:** Instead of going up immediately, move further right, towards the corridor, let's say to (4.0, 2.0).
3. **Upward Movement:**  From there,  move upwards to a point above the obstacles, around (4.0, 19.0).
4. **Towards the Goal:** Now we have a clear path to the goal. Move right towards the goal set, for example, to (19.0, 19.0).
5. **End:** Finally, move down into the goal set, ending at (19.0, 18.5). 

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0),  
    (4.0, 2.0),
    (4.0, 19.0),
    (19.0, 19.0),
    (19.0, 18.5) 
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles and stays within the defined start and goal sets.
