# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[16.3, 17.3], [12.4, 19.6], [12.8, 17.2], [13.4, 16.9]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.2, 17.0], [8.8, 10.8], [7.4, 17.8], [1.7, 17.7]]
			Obstacle 3: [[19.8, 16.0], [13.3, 12.9], [16.5, 5.1], [18.8, 8.0]]
			Obstacle 4: [[3.6, 16.4], [7.6, 15.4], [9.4, 19.5], [4.6, 18.3]]
			Obstacle 5: [[19.3, 17.5], [17.2, 18.1], [18.1, 15.7], [18.7, 15.4]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:25:11 PM] The path can be planned by initially moving upwards, avoiding Obstacle 2 and 4, to a y-coordinate greater than all obstacles. Then, the path can move rightwards towards the goal position, avoiding Obstacle 5 by staying to its left.

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # start in the start set
    (1.0, 21.0),  # move upwards, clearing all obstacles
    (19.0, 21.0), # move rightwards, staying above Obstacle 5

]

[08/22/2024 04:25:17 PM] The initial path went directly upwards (1.0, 1.0) -> (1.0, 21.0), which intersected with Obstacle 2.  To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle.

One option is to move rightwards first, staying clear of Obstacle 2, then proceed upwards to the goal. This means adding a waypoint to the right of Obstacle 2 before moving upwards.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 1.0),   # Move rightwards, staying clear of Obstacle 2
    (9.0, 21.0),  # Move upwards, now clear of Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 21.0), # Move towards the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End within the goal set

[08/22/2024 04:25:22 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid Obstacle 4. I will move the waypoint at (9.0, 1.0) to the right, ensuring it's clear of the obstacle. By observing the coordinates of Obstacle 4, a safe passage can be established by moving to the right of the obstacle. 

Let's try moving to (10.0, 1.0) to go around Obstacle 4. This point is to the right of the obstacle and leaves enough margin to avoid a collision. The path then can continue upwards as previously planned.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (10.0, 1.0), # Adjusted waypoint to avoid Obstacle 4
