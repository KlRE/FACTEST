# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[16.9, 17.4], [16.0, 17.9], [16.1, 16.1], [16.7, 13.1]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:38:16 PM] The provided environment has a single obstacle located closer to the goal set. Therefore, the path can be planned to first move away from the start set in any direction until it's past the obstacle and then move towards the goal set.

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # start in the start set
    (1.0, 10.0),  # move downwards to avoid going through the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)   # move diagonally to end in the goal set
]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:38:21 PM] The current path directly cuts through Obstacle 1. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle. Looking at the position of Obstacle 1, it seems optimal to go around it from the left side.

Here's how we can adjust the path:

1. **Maintain initial upward movement:** Keep the initial waypoint (1.0, 10.0) to clear the starting area.
2. **Move leftward:**  Introduce a new waypoint to the left of Obstacle 1, for instance, (1.0, 18.0). This ensures clear passage around the obstacle.
3. **Proceed to the goal:**  Finally, connect to the goal waypoint (19.0, 19.0). 

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [(1.0, 10.0), (1.0, 18.0), (19.0, 19.0)]
```

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:38:27 PM] The initial path starts outside the designated start set. To rectify this, the path should begin within the start set boundaries, defined by  [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]. A suitable starting point within this region could be (1.0, 1.0). From there, the path needs to navigate to the goal set while circumventing the obstacle.  A direct path to the goal is obstructed by Obstacle 1. Therefore, a detour around this obstacle is necessary.

 A possible path could involve moving vertically upwards from the starting point until clearing the obstacle. Then, the path can proceed horizontally towards the goal set. 

Here's a potential revised path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (1.0, 18.0),  # Move upwards, clearing Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 18.0)   # Move rightwards towards the center of the goal set
]
```
