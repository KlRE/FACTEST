# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[16.3, 2.9], [19.2, 13.0], [19.0, 14.7], [17.0, 8.3]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:38:34 PM] The provided obstacle sits in the upper-right quadrant of the path from start to goal.  Therefore a viable path would be to move horizontally, then vertically.

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start at a point within the start set
    (17.0, 1.0),  # Move horizontally, staying below the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move vertically to a point within the goal set 
]

		Segment 2 between points (17.0, 1.0) and (19.0, 19.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 1: [[16.3, 2.9], [19.2, 13.0], [19.0, 14.7], [17.0, 8.3]]

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:38:40 PM] The initial path intersects with Obstacle 1 because it attempts to directly connect a point near the start set to a point near the goal set. To avoid this obstacle, we can adjust the path to go around it.

First, we can maintain the first waypoint (1.0, 1.0).  Then, instead of directly going towards the goal set, we can add a waypoint to the right of the obstacle and below its highest y-coordinate, such as (20.0, 8.0). This waypoint allows us to circumvent the obstacle. Finally, we can connect this waypoint to the final waypoint in the goal set (19.0, 19.0).

Here is the updated path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (20.0, 8.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```
 
This new path avoids Obstacle 1 while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set.

[08/22/2024 03:39:05 PM] The original path cuts through obstacle 1 because it attempts to move in a straight line to the endpoint.  To avoid this, the path needs to initially move south to navigate around the obstacle.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start set
    (1.0, 0.0),  # Move south to avoid the obstacle
    (20.0, 0.0),  # Move east, clear of the obstacle
    (20.0, 19.0)   # Move north to the goal set 
]
```

This path first moves south to avoid the obstacle entirely, then proceeds east towards the goal, and finally north to reach the target. This avoids any intersection with obstacle 1.
