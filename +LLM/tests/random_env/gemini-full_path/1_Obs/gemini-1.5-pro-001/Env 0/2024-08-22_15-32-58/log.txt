# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[16.5, 17.7], [13.3, 16.2], [16.5, 8.4], [17.1, 8.6]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:33:05 PM] The provided environment has a single obstacle located closer to the goal position. A viable path involves navigating around this obstacle to reach the goal. 

* **Start Point:** (1.0, 1.0) - Center of the start quadrilateral.
* **Maneuver:**  Proceed diagonally towards the goal position until clear of the obstacle's y-range.  Then, move directly towards the goal.
* **End Point:**  (19.0, 19.0) - Center of the goal quadrilateral.

Here's the proposed waypoint path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start Point
    (12.0, 12.0),  # Diagonal movement (adjust if needed to clear obstacle) 
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Goal Point
]
```

**Important:** It is crucial to visually verify this path against a scaled representation of the quadrilaterals to ensure obstacle avoidance. The provided waypoints are a suggestion based on the description and may need minor adjustments for a safe and valid path.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:33:11 PM] The path intersects with Obstacle 1 because the straight line connecting (12.0, 12.0) and (19.0, 19.0) cuts through the obstacle. To avoid this, we need to add waypoints to guide the path around the obstacle. 

Considering the obstacle's location and shape, we can adjust the path by first going below the obstacle and then moving towards the goal.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    
    (12.0, 12.0), 
    (12.0, 7.0),  # Move down, staying clear below Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 7.0),  # Move right, staying below Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move up to the goal 
]
```

This path first moves towards the obstacle as before, then goes down to a point clearly below the obstacle, then moves right to a point directly below the goal, and finally moves up to reach the goal. This way, it avoids any intersection with the obstacle.
