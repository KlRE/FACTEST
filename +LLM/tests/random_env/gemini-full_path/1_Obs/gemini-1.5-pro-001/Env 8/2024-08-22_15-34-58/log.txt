# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[7.5, 17.4], [4.0, 15.1], [11.4, 15.2], [12.5, 16.5]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.

]

[08/22/2024 03:35:13 PM] The original path goes directly through Obstacle 1. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around it. 

1.  **Start:** Keep the starting point at (1.0, 1.0).
2.  **Navigate below Obstacle 1:** Obstacle 1's lowest y-coordinate is 15.1.  Guide the path below this obstacle to avoid collision. A waypoint at (3.0, 14.0) would achieve this.
3. **Navigate towards the goal:** From (3.0, 14.0), the path can move towards the goal without intersecting Obstacle 1. A waypoint at (15.0, 19.0) positions the path for entry into the goal set.
4.  **End:**  Finally, connect to a point within the goal set, like (19.0, 19.0).

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (3.0, 14.0), 
    (15.0, 19.0),

[08/22/2024 03:35:19 PM] The original path intersects with Obstacle 1 because it attempts to move directly from the start to the end set. To avoid this, we need to navigate around the obstacle. 

1. **Starting Point:** We can keep the starting point at (1.0, 1.0).

2. **Navigating the Obstacle:**  Obstacle 1 occupies a space roughly between x-coordinates 4.0 and 12.5, and y-coordinates 15.1 and 17.4. To avoid it, we can direct the path upwards before the x-coordinate 4.0.  Let's add a waypoint at (3.0, 14.0) to guide the path upwards. 

3. **Reaching the Goal:** From (3.0, 14.0), we can move towards the goal set. 

Therefore, the updated path is:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (3.0, 14.0),
    (15.0, 19.0),

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:35:27 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid intersecting Obstacle 1. To navigate around it, we can route the path above the obstacle. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (3.0, 14.0),  # Keep this waypoint as it's still valid
    (3.0, 17.5),  # Move upwards to a point above Obstacle 1 
    (15.0, 17.5), # Move rightwards, staying above Obstacle 1
    (15.0, 19.0), # Move down to the original path's waypoint
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(1.0, 1.0) & (3.0, 14.0):**  These points remain unchanged as they don't intersect the obstacle. 
2. **(3.0, 17.5):**  Instead of directly moving towards (15.0, 19.0), we first go upwards to a y-coordinate greater than the highest point of Obstacle 1 (17.4). 
3. **(15.0, 17.5):** We move rightwards, maintaining a safe distance above Obstacle 1.
4. **(15.0, 19.0) & (19.0, 19.0):**  We can rejoin the original path as these segments are clear of the obstacle. 
 
This new path avoids the obstacle by going around it, ensuring a collision-free trajectory.
