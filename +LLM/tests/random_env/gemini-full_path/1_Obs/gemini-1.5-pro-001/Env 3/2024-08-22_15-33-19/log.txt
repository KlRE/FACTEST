# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[11.5, 17.4], [6.2, 14.3], [8.8, 11.8], [15.3, 10.6]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:33:26 PM] The path needs to navigate around Obstacle 1 to reach the goal set.  The current second segment cuts right through the middle of the obstacle.  

To avoid this, the path can first proceed diagonally towards the lower right, aiming to pass below and to the right of Obstacle 1. Once clear of the obstacle, the path can then head towards the goal set. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0),    
    (10.0, 8.0),  
    (19.0, 19.0)

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:33:31 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid Obstacle 1. We can do this by routing the path around the obstacle. 

1. **Start:** Keep the starting point at (2.0, 1.0).

2. **Navigate below Obstacle 1:** Since the obstacle is situated towards the upper part of the grid, let's guide the path downwards to go around it. A waypoint at (10.0, 5.0) would place the path safely below Obstacle 1. 

3. **Proceed towards the goal:** From (10.0, 5.0), the path can move directly towards the goal without encountering any obstacles. 

Therefore, a corrected path would be:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0), 
    (10.0, 5.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)
]

[08/22/2024 03:34:23 PM] The provided path intersects obstacle 1 because the line segment connecting (10.0, 5.0) and (19.0, 19.0) cuts through the obstacle's area. 

To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around the obstacle. One approach is to route the path above obstacle 1:

1. **Maintain the starting point:** (2.0, 1.0)
2. **Navigate above obstacle 1:**  Introduce a waypoint to steer clear of the obstacle. A suitable waypoint could be (10.0, 18.0), ensuring it lies above the obstacle's highest point. 
3. **Proceed to the goal:** Connect to the final waypoint in the goal set (19.0, 19.0).

Therefore, the adjusted path is as follows:

```
new_path = [(2.0, 1.0), (10.0, 18.0), (19.0, 19.0)]
```

    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[11.5, 17.4], [6.2, 14.3], [8.8, 11.8], [15.3, 10.6]]

    
## Your generated path:
    path = [(2.0, 1.0), (10.0, 18.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    Obstacle Avoidance (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
		Segment 1 between points (2.0, 1.0) and (10.0, 18.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 1: [[11.5, 17.4], [6.2, 14.3], [8.8, 11.8], [15.3, 10.6]]
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:34:27 PM] The initial path intersects with Obstacle 1 because it attempts to move directly from the start to the end set. 
To avoid this, the path needs to first navigate around this obstacle. 

Given the obstacle's position and shape, the best approach would be to move vertically from the starting point until clearing the obstacle's highest y-coordinate and then proceed horizontally towards the goal set.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0),    # Start point
    (2.0, 18.0),    # Move vertically upward, clearing Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 18.0),   # Move horizontally towards the goal set 
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End point within the goal set
]
```
