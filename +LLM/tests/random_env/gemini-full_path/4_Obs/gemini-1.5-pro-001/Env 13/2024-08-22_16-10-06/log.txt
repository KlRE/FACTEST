			Obstacle 1: [[15.8, 8.1], [16.7, 0.5], [18.7, 12.0], [17.0, 12.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[19.8, 15.9], [14.5, 17.4], [16.2, 15.6], [18.1, 15.5]]

        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:10:11 PM] By visualizing the provided start, goal, and obstacle positions, a path can be derived that avoids all obstacles:

1. **Start:** Choose a starting point within the start quadrilateral, such as (1, 1).
2. **Move Upwards:** Navigate vertically upwards to  (1, 10) to avoid any potential collisions with obstacles.
3. **Move Rightwards:**  Proceed horizontally to the right, towards the goal position, by moving to (19, 10). This movement avoids all obstacles as it stays clear of their defined boundaries. 
4. **Move Downwards:** Finally, navigate downwards to a point within the goal quadrilateral, such as (19, 19).

Therefore, the path can be represented by the following waypoints:

```
new_path = [
    (1, 1),
    (1, 10),
    (19, 10),
    (19, 19)
]
```

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:10:16 PM] The initial path goes through obstacles 1 and 2. To correct this, we can adjust the path to go around these obstacles.

First, we can navigate above obstacle 1 by increasing the y-coordinate of the second waypoint. Then, to avoid obstacle 2, we can add a waypoint to the left of obstacle 2 before moving to the goal. 

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start point
    (1.0, 13.0),  # Move upward, clearing obstacle 1
    (16.0, 13.0), # Move rightward, staying above obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move to the goal point
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles while staying within the defined start and goal sets.

[08/22/2024 04:10:26 PM] The provided path goes above obstacles 1 and 4 but unfortunately collides with obstacles 2 and 3. 

To correct the path, we need to navigate around obstacles 2 and 3. We can do this by adjusting the path to go below these obstacles. 

Here's how we can adjust the path:

1. **From the starting point (1.0, 1.0), maintain a straight path until x = 16.0, maneuvering below obstacles 1 and 4. Let's say this point is (16.0, 7.0).** 
2. **From (16.0, 7.0), continue moving rightwards, staying below obstacles 2 and 3, until you reach a point where you can safely turn upwards towards the goal set. This point could be (17.0, 7.0).**
3. **From (17.0, 7.0), move upwards towards the goal, ensuring you stay clear of obstacle 2.  A possible waypoint here could be (17.0, 17.0).**
4. **Finally, move rightwards from (17.0, 17.0) to reach the goal set. This can be achieved with the point (19.0, 19.0).**

Therefore, the adjusted path would look like this:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (16.0, 7.0),
    (17.0, 7.0),
    (17.0, 17.0),
    (19.0, 19.0) 
]
```

This new path avoids all obstacles while staying within the start and goal sets. Remember, these waypoints are suggestions, and their exact coordinates might need slight adjustments to ensure a safe distance from the obstacles.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:10:33 PM] The initial path attempts to go directly to the goal, intersecting multiple obstacles.  We need to navigate around these obstacles strategically.

1. **Initial Path Analysis:** The path segments between (1.0, 1.0) and (17.0, 17.0) cross through the heart of the obstacle field.

2. **Identifying Safe Zones:** There seems to be a relatively clear area to the south and east of the obstacles.

3. **Adjusting the Path:** We can reroute the path to go south first, then east, and finally north to the goal position:

    - From the start point (1.0, 1.0), move south to (1.0, 0.0).
    - Proceed east to a point safely past the obstacles, like (21.0, 0.0).
    - Finally, move north to the goal position (19.0, 19.0).

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (1.0, 0.0), 
    (21.0, 0.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This new path avoids all obstacles by navigating around them in a safer manner.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.8, 8.1], [16.7, 0.5], [18.7, 12.0], [17.0, 12.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[19.8, 15.9], [14.5, 17.4], [16.2, 15.6], [18.1, 15.5]]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    Obstacle Avoidance (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
		Segment 3 between points (21.0, 0.0) and (19.0, 19.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 2: [[19.8, 15.9], [14.5, 17.4], [16.2, 15.6], [18.1, 15.5]]
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [

        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

### Example Response

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:10:41 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 2.  The current path attempts to move directly from left to right and then upwards, causing a collision. To avoid this, we can route the path around the obstacles in a way that stays clear of their boundaries.

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Start:** Begin at the same start point (1.0, 1.0).
2. **Move Right:** Proceed rightwards, staying below Obstacle 3.  A waypoint at (10.0, 1.0) could be suitable.
3. **Move Upwards:**  Navigate upwards, clearing the right side of Obstacle 3. A waypoint at (10.0, 16.0) would achieve this.
4. **Move Right:**  Continue rightwards, passing above all obstacles. A waypoint at (19.0, 16.0) places the path in a safe position.
5. **Reach the Goal:** Finally, move downwards to enter the goal set. The end point (19.0, 19.0) lies within the goal set. 

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (10.0, 1.0), 
    (10.0, 16.0),
    (19.0, 16.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)

[08/22/2024 04:11:27 PM] The initial path intersected with obstacles 2 and 3. To address this, we need to adjust the path to navigate around these obstacles. 

1. **Initial Segment:** The first segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (10.0, 1.0) is fine as it stays clear of all obstacles.

2. **Navigating Around Obstacles:** Instead of going straight to (10.0, 16.0), we need to guide the path around obstacles 2 and 3. A viable option is to move upwards along the x=10 line until we clear obstacle 3, then move right towards the goal.

3. **Final Approach:** Once we clear obstacle 3, we can safely move right and then up to reach the goal set.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      // Initial point within the start set
    (10.0, 1.0),     // Move right 
    (10.0, 19.0),    // Move up to clear obstacle 3
    (19.0, 19.0)     // Move right to the goal set
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles and successfully connects the start and goal sets.
