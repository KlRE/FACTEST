# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[2.5, 0.8], [8.7, 0.3], [6.2, 9.8], [5.0, 11.5]]
			Obstacle 2: [[15.3, 16.2], [15.6, 13.3], [17.5, 11.7], [16.0, 15.9]]

]

[08/22/2024 04:03:48 PM] The original path attempts to directly traverse horizontally from left to right at a y-coordinate of 12.0.  This causes a collision with Obstacle 2 which occupies space at that y-coordinate along the path. 

To avoid this, we can adjust the path to go above Obstacle 2, as it appears to be the only obstruction in the direct path from start to end. We can maintain the original path's y-coordinate for the first segment. For the second segment, instead of y = 12.0, we can increase it to y = 17.0 to clear Obstacle 2.  The third segment can remain similar to the original path, just connecting to the new second waypoint.

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0), 
    (1.0, 17.0),  # Go above Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 17.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)
]

[08/22/2024 04:04:04 PM] The original path intersects with obstacle 3 because the segment directly attempts to cross from left to right while obstacle 3 acts as a wall in the middle. 

To circumvent this, we can adapt the original path to first move upwards, clearing the obstacle's y-coordinate range, before proceeding rightwards towards the goal. This strategy avoids intersections and maintains a safe distance from obstacle 3.

Therefore, we can adjust the path by adding a waypoint above obstacle 3:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0), 
    (1.0, 20.0),  # Move upwards to be above the obstacle
    (19.0, 20.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)
