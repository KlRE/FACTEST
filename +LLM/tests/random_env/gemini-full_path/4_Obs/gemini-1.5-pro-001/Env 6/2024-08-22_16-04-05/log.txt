# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[0.1, 15.0], [14.1, 11.7], [4.3, 17.3], [0.4, 15.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[12.0, 8.7], [16.2, 6.2], [15.9, 11.4], [13.1, 13.3]]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:04:11 PM] The path can be planned by navigating between the obstacles while making sure to maintain a safe distance:
* Start at (1, 1), which is inside the start set.
* Move diagonally upwards to (2, 3) to avoid the lower left corner of Obstacle 1.
* Continue upwards to (2, 16) giving a safe distance from Obstacle 1 and the top vertex of Obstacle 2.
* Move diagonally upwards to (6, 18) to avoid the top left corner of Obstacle 4. 
* Continue rightwards to (17, 18) maintaining a safe distance above obstacles 2 and 3.
* Move downwards to (17, 19) to avoid the bottom right corner of Obstacle 4.
* Finally, move right to reach the goal set at (19, 19).

[08/22/2024 04:04:19 PM] The initial path has multiple intersections with the obstacles. We need to adjust the path to go around these obstacles.

1. **Segment 2 and 3:** The path needs to navigate around Obstacle 1. We can achieve this by adding a waypoint to the right of Obstacle 1 at (15.0, 14.0). This will allow the path to go around Obstacle 1 without intersecting it.

2. **Segment 3 and 4:** The adjusted path still intersects Obstacle 4.  To avoid this, we can add another waypoint above Obstacle 4 at (8.0, 20.0). This will allow the path to go around the top of Obstacle 4.

Therefore, the new path, adjusted to avoid obstacles, is:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (2.0, 3.0), 
    (15.0, 14.0), # New waypoint to the right of Obstacle 1
    (8.0, 20.0), # New waypoint above Obstacle 4
    (17.0, 18.0), 
    (17.0, 19.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)

[08/22/2024 04:04:25 PM] The initial path crosses multiple obstacles due to the long segments allowing for intersections. To correct this, the path needs to navigate around the obstacles using shorter segments. 

Starting at (1.0, 1.0), a viable path can be created by first moving above Obstacle 1. This can be achieved by adding a waypoint at (1.0, 16.0). 

Next, the path needs to navigate between Obstacles 1 and 2.  Adding a waypoint at (5.0, 16.0) allows for a safe passage between these obstacles. 

From there, the path can proceed to the goal region by moving above Obstacle 4. This can be achieved by adding waypoints at (5.0, 21.0) and (19.0, 21.0).

Finally, the path can descend into the goal set.

Therefore, the updated path is:

```
new_path = [(1.0, 1.0), (1.0, 16.0), (5.0, 16.0), (5.0, 21.0), (19.0, 21.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

			Obstacle 4: [[3.1, 19.6], [4.7, 11.2], [11.4, 16.4], [9.7, 19.0]]
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:04:33 PM] The initial path attempts to move directly upward and then rightward, leading to collisions with obstacles 1 and 4. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate a more complex route.

1. **Starting Point:** (1.0, 1.0) - Remains within the start set.

2. **Navigating Obstacles 1 & 4:** 
    - Instead of moving straight up, we need to navigate around obstacle 1. 
    - We can move rightward, staying clear of obstacle 1's x-coordinates.
    -  A waypoint at (7.0, 1.0) positions us to the right of obstacle 1.
    - Now, we can move upward, aiming for a y-coordinate above obstacle 4.
    - A waypoint at (7.0, 20.0) places us above all obstacles.

3. **Reaching the Goal Set:**
    - From our current position, we can move directly leftward towards the goal set.
    - A waypoint at (19.0, 20.0) puts us within the goal set. 

4. **Final Point:** (19.0, 19.0) -  Remains within the goal set.

Therefore, the adjusted path is as follows:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (7.0, 1.0),
    (7.0, 20.0),
    (19.0, 20.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.

[08/22/2024 04:04:40 PM] The initial path crosses obstacles because it attempts to move directly upwards from the start set.  To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around the obstacles by utilizing open areas in the environment.

2. **Navigate Right:** (15.0, 1.0) - Move right, staying below obstacles 1, 2, and 4. 
3. **Move Upwards:** (15.0, 17.0) -  After safely clearing the obstacles, move upwards towards the goal.
4. **Approach Goal:** (19.0, 17.0) -  Move horizontally towards the goal.
5. **Enter Goal:** (19.0, 19.0) - Move upwards to end inside the goal set.

[08/22/2024 04:05:07 PM] The initial path goes straight up at x=15, causing it to intersect with obstacles 2 and 3. To avoid this, we can route the path around the right side of these obstacles. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (15.0, 1.0),  # Move right
    (15.0, 5.0),  # Move down, staying clear of obstacle 2
    (21.0, 5.0), # Move right, clearing obstacle 3 
    (21.0, 19.0), # Move up 
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move left to the goal 
]
```

This path first moves to the right, then navigates down to y=5 to avoid obstacle 2. It then proceeds right to x=21 to clear obstacle 3 before moving up to the goal's y-coordinate. Finally, it moves left to reach the goal point. This path avoids all obstacles while staying within the defined environment.
