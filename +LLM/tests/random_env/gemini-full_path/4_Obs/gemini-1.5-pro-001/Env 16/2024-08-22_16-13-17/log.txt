# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.3, 13.8], [15.9, 7.8], [17.9, 7.8], [15.5, 16.3]]
			Obstacle 2: [[12.7, 15.1], [17.4, 18.1], [15.8, 18.7], [13.5, 18.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[2.4, 18.4], [9.7, 16.2], [13.7, 15.7], [11.4, 17.5]]
			Obstacle 4: [[3.8, 19.2], [4.4, 12.9], [5.3, 15.6], [4.0, 19.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.

[08/22/2024 04:13:33 PM] The original path attempts to move directly upwards and encounters Obstacle 4. To correct this, we can first navigate around this obstacle.

1. **Initial Maneuver:** Start from (1.0, 1.0) and move upwards to (1.0, 12.0), staying clear of Obstacle 4. 

2. **Lateral Movement:**  Move rightward to (10.0, 12.0). This keeps us below Obstacles 2 and 3.

3. **Vertical Ascent:** Proceed upwards to (10.0, 19.0), safely navigating past the top of Obstacle 2.

4. **Final Approach:**  Move rightward to (17.0, 19.0) and finally reach the goal set at (19.0, 19.0).


This strategy avoids all obstacles by carefully maneuvering around them.

**New Path:**

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:13:41 PM] The feedback indicates that the segment (10.0, 12.0) to (10.0, 19.0) crosses Obstacle 3.  Looking at the obstacle coordinates, we can see that Obstacle 3 presents a barrier in the x-direction between roughly x=9.7 and x=13.7 for the y-range that the path segment covers. 

To avoid this, we can route the path around the left side of Obstacle 3. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [(1.0, 1.0), (1.0, 12.0), (8.0, 12.0), (8.0, 20.0), (17.0, 20.0), (19.0, 19.0)] 
```

Here's the thought process behind the changes:

1. **Original segment:** (10.0, 12.0) to (10.0, 19.0)
2. **Problem:** This vertical segment directly intersects Obstacle 3.
3. **Solution:** 
   *  Introduce a new waypoint to the left of Obstacle 3: (8.0, 12.0)
   *  Modify the path to go around Obstacle 3: (1.0, 12.0) -> (8.0, 12.0) -> (8.0, 20.0) 
4. **Justification:**
   * This adjusted path avoids crossing Obstacle 3 by keeping to the left (lower x-values).
   * The new segments are free from intersections with any obstacles. 
   * The path still starts and ends within the correct sets.

[08/22/2024 04:14:23 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid Obstacle 3. We can do this by going east before moving north, allowing us to navigate around the obstacle.

Here is a possible updated path:

```
new_path = [(1.0, 1.0), (1.0, 12.0), (14.0, 12.0), (14.0, 20.0), (17.0, 20.0), (19.0, 19.0)]
```

Here's the thought process:

1. **Identify the problematic segment:** The feedback indicates that the segment between (8.0, 12.0) and (8.0, 20.0) intersects Obstacle 3. 
2. **Analyze Obstacle 3:** Obstacle 3 is located on the left side of the path segment, with its rightmost point having an x-coordinate close to 10.
3. **Devise a strategy:** To avoid the obstacle, we should route the path to the right of Obstacle 3.  
4. **Adjust the path:**
   - Instead of going directly north from (1.0, 12.0) to (8.0, 20.0), first, move east to a point beyond Obstacle 3's x-coordinate, for example, (14.0, 12.0). 
   - From there, proceed north to (14.0, 20.0).
   -  Keep the remaining waypoints the same as they already successfully reach the goal set. 
5. **New path:** This results in the suggested new path, which avoids all obstacles.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.3, 13.8], [15.9, 7.8], [17.9, 7.8], [15.5, 16.3]]
			Obstacle 2: [[12.7, 15.1], [17.4, 18.1], [15.8, 18.7], [13.5, 18.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[2.4, 18.4], [9.7, 16.2], [13.7, 15.7], [11.4, 17.5]]
			Obstacle 4: [[3.8, 19.2], [4.4, 12.9], [5.3, 15.6], [4.0, 19.0]]

    
## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.0, 1.0), (1.0, 12.0), (14.0, 12.0), (14.0, 20.0), (17.0, 20.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    Obstacle Avoidance (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
		Segment 3 between points (14.0, 12.0) and (14.0, 20.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 2: [[12.7, 15.1], [17.4, 18.1], [15.8, 18.7], [13.5, 18.0]]
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:14:29 PM] The feedback correctly pointed out the intersection with Obstacle 2. To address this, we can adjust the path to navigate around this obstacle. 

First, instead of going straight up to (14.0, 20.0), we can aim for a point to the left of Obstacle 2, such as (12.0, 14.0). This allows us to bypass the obstacle completely.

Next, we can add a waypoint to the right of Obstacle 2, like (18.0, 14.0) to ensure a safe passage around it before proceeding to the goal. 

Here's the updated path:

```
new_path = [(1.0, 1.0), (1.0, 12.0), (12.0, 14.0), (18.0, 14.0), (18.0, 20.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:14:36 PM] The feedback indicates that the segment between (12.0, 14.0) and (18.0, 14.0) intersects with Obstacle 1. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate above Obstacle 1.

Here's a possible adjustment:

1. **From (12.0, 14.0):** Instead of going directly to x=18.0, move upwards to a y-coordinate greater than the highest point of Obstacle 1 (y=16.3). Let's choose (12.0, 17.0).
2. **Navigate Right:** Now, safely move rightwards to a point where a clear path to the goal is available. A suitable waypoint could be (16.0, 17.0). 
3. **Proceed to Goal:**  From (16.0, 17.0), the path can move directly to the goal set without encountering any obstacles.

Therefore, the corrected path is:

```
new_path = [(1.0, 1.0), (1.0, 12.0), (12.0, 14.0), (12.0, 17.0), (16.0, 17.0), (18.0, 17.0), (19.0, 19.0)]
