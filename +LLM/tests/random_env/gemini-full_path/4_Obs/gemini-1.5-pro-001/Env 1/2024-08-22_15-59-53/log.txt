# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[8.6, 17.6], [17.7, 16.1], [14.8, 18.1], [10.0, 19.6]]
			Obstacle 2: [[17.6, 18.6], [15.1, 19.5], [15.5, 16.6], [15.8, 16.1]]
			Obstacle 3: [[4.3, 15.5], [4.7, 15.2], [11.7, 17.0], [5.7, 16.6]]
			Obstacle 4: [[16.4, 19.0], [15.5, 17.7], [16.2, 15.5], [17.5, 14.3]]

    
## Instructions

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:59:58 PM] The path can be planned by initially moving upwards, navigating around obstacles 1 and 3 to the right, then proceeding rightwards above obstacle 1. Finally, the path will move downwards to the goal set, passing between obstacles 2 and 4.

new_path = [

[08/22/2024 04:00:09 PM] The original path goes through obstacles 1 and 2. To avoid this, we need to adjust the path to go around these obstacles.

- We can navigate around obstacle 1 by maintaining a y-coordinate below 16 until we clear its x-coordinate range. 
-  Obstacle 2 presents a challenge as it extends further in the x-direction.  To circumvent it, we can route the path above this obstacle by increasing the y-coordinate above its maximum y-coordinate.

Therefore, the adjusted path could look like this:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    
    (1.0, 10.0),   
    (6.0, 10.0),   
    (6.0, 21.0),   
    (19.0, 21.0),   
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This path avoids both obstacle 1 and obstacle 2 by first moving right below obstacle 1, then going up beyond the top of obstacle 2, and finally reaching the goal set.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:00:16 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 3. We can do this by going around the obstacle to the right. 

Instead of going directly from (1.0, 10.0) to (6.0, 10.0) and then straight up to (6.0, 21.0), we can first move right to a point beyond the x-coordinate of Obstacle 3, then move upwards to clear the y-coordinate of Obstacle 3, and finally go left towards the goal. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (1.0, 10.0), 
    (12.0, 10.0),  # Go right, clearing Obstacle 3 horizontally
    (12.0, 21.0),  # Go up, clearing Obstacle 3 vertically
    (6.0, 21.0), # Go left towards the original path
    (6.0, 21.0),
    (19.0, 21.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This new path avoids all obstacles and successfully connects the start and goal sets.

    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:00:24 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid Obstacle 1.  We can route the path around the left side of Obstacle 1.

1. **Keep Initial Segment:** The first segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (1.0, 10.0) is fine.
2. **Navigate Left of Obstacle 1:** Instead of going straight up to (12.0, 10.0), let's go left to a point like (6.0, 10.0) to avoid Obstacle 1.
3. **Proceed Upwards:** From (6.0, 10.0), we can safely move upwards to (6.0, 21.0).
4. **Continue with Original Path:** The rest of the original path from (6.0, 21.0) to (19.0, 19.0) remains valid.

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [(1.0, 1.0), (1.0, 10.0), (6.0, 10.0), (6.0, 21.0), (12.0, 21.0), (19.0, 21.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:00:32 PM] The feedback correctly points out that the segment (6.0, 10.0) to (6.0, 21.0) intersects with Obstacle 3. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle. 

One approach:

1. **Current Path Analysis:** The existing path attempts to move vertically upwards and then horizontally towards the goal. 
2. **Obstacle Position:** Obstacle 3 sits to the right of the start set and extends upwards, blocking a direct vertical path. 
3. **Identify Safe Passage:** There's a clear area to the left of Obstacle 3.
4. **Adjust Path:** 
    * Instead of going straight up, guide the path leftwards to bypass Obstacle 3 completely.
    * Once clear of the obstacle, continue upwards to a point above Obstacle 3.
    * Finally, proceed rightwards towards the goal. 

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start
    (1.0, 10.0), # Initial upward movement
    (3.0, 10.0), # Move left to clear Obstacle 3 
    (3.0, 18.0), # Move upwards, now clear of Obstacle 3
    (12.0, 18.0), # Move rightwards 
    (19.0, 18.0), # Continue towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End 
]
```

This new path avoids all obstacles and reaches the goal set.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:00:41 PM] The initial path goes straight from the start set to the goal set, resulting in collisions with obstacles 1, 2 and 4. To avoid these, the path needs to navigate around the obstacles. 

- **Segment 4 & 5:** These segments are the most problematic as they pass directly through obstacles 1, 2, and 4. 
- **Navigating Obstacles:** We can avoid these obstacles by going south of them. To do this,  we can add waypoints to direct the path downwards after clearing the start set. This approach avoids crossing any obstacles. 

Here is the modified path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (1.0, 10.0), 
    (3.0, 10.0), 
    (3.0, 8.0), #Added waypoint to move downwards
    (12.0, 8.0), #Added waypoint to move right
    (12.0, 18.0), #Added waypoint to move upwards
    (19.0, 18.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles by going around their southern boundaries.
