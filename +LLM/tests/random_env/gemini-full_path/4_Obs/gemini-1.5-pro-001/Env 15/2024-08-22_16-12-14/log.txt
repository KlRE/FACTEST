# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[18.4, 6.9], [12.0, 5.2], [12.2, 2.0], [19.5, 1.1]]
			Obstacle 2: [[9.7, 5.9], [15.5, 5.1], [17.9, 17.7], [10.4, 15.3]]
			Obstacle 3: [[12.0, 15.5], [18.2, 17.6], [17.4, 18.1], [14.7, 19.3]]
			Obstacle 4: [[5.8, 19.4], [10.7, 11.1], [11.0, 12.8], [9.2, 18.3]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:12:21 PM] A viable path weaves around the obstacles, staying closest to their top borders for the most direct route:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0),  # Start within start set
    (9.5, 6.5),  # Navigate above Obstacle 1 
    (16.0, 17.0), # Move towards the goal, staying above Obstacle 2 and 3
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within goal set 
]
```

**Explanation:**

* The path starts at (2.0, 1.0), safely inside the start quadrilateral.
* It then takes a diagonal path upwards to (9.5, 6.5), staying clear above the top corner of Obstacle 1.
* Next, it continues diagonally upwards to (16.0, 17.0), navigating a course that remains above Obstacles 2 and 3 by staying close to their top edges.
* Finally, it makes a final diagonal movement to (19.0, 19.0), landing within the goal quadrilateral. 

This path successfully avoids all obstacles while reaching the goal from the start.

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:12:33 PM] The original path collides with Obstacle 1 in two segments. To avoid this, we need to adjust the path to navigate around it. 

1. **Initial Segment:** The first segment from (2.0, 1.0) to (9.5, 6.5) appears to be free of obstacles and can remain unchanged.

2. **Navigating Around Obstacle 1:** Instead of going directly towards the goal, we need to guide the path around the obstacle. We can achieve this by:
    - Moving upwards from (9.5, 6.5) to a point above Obstacle 1. A suitable waypoint could be (9.5, 8.0).
    - Then, proceed rightwards to a point with an x-coordinate greater than Obstacle 1, such as (19.0, 8.0).

3. **Final Approach:** From (19.0, 8.0), we can safely move downwards to the goal position at (19.0, 19.0). 

**Therefore, the new path is:**

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0), 
    (9.5, 6.5), 
    (9.5, 8.0), 
    (19.0, 8.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This path successfully avoids all obstacles and reaches the goal by navigating around Obstacle 1.

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:12:41 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid intersecting with Obstacle 2. To achieve this, we can introduce additional waypoints to navigate around the obstacle.

1. **Initial Path Analysis:** The problematic segment is between (9.5, 8.0) and (19.0, 8.0), which cuts through Obstacle 2.

2. **Identifying a Safe Passage:**  We can observe that moving above Obstacle 2 is possible. 

3. **Adjusting the Path:**
   - Keep the first two waypoints: (2.0, 1.0) and (9.5, 6.5).
   - Instead of directly going to (9.5, 8.0), move upward to a point above Obstacle 2, for example, (9.5, 18.0). 
   - Proceed horizontally to the right, above Obstacle 2, to a point like (17.0, 18.0).
   - Finally, move down to the goal position (19.0, 19.0).

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0), 
    (9.5, 6.5), 
    (9.5, 18.0), 
    (17.0, 18.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This new path avoids all obstacles and successfully connects the start and goal sets.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.

[08/22/2024 04:13:09 PM] The original path attempts to navigate directly to the goal but encounters obstacles in the process. 

**Analyzing the Obstacles:**

* **Obstacle 4** sits in the path between the start and the upper right quadrant of the map. 
* **Obstacle 3** blocks a direct path in the upper portion of the map.

**Adjustments:**

1. **Navigate Below Obstacles:**  Instead of going above Obstacle 4, we can plot a path that stays below all obstacles. 
2. **Waypoint Around Obstacle 2:**  To go below obstacles, we need to navigate around Obstacle 2. Adding a waypoint to the right and below Obstacle 2 allows for this.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0),   # Start Point
    (9.0, 1.0),   # Move right, staying below obstacles
    (16.0, 1.0),  # Continue right, below obstacles
    (16.0, 19.0), # Move upwards to the goal's latitude
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Move right to the goal point
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

* The path now prioritizes moving right and then up, staying clear of all obstacles.
* This strategy avoids complex maneuvers and provides a clear, unobstructed route.

[08/22/2024 04:13:16 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid the obstacles intersecting segment 3. To do this, we can route the path around the obstacles.

1. **Initial path analysis:** The current path attempts to move directly upwards from (16.0, 1.0) to (16.0, 19.0). This crosses multiple obstacles. 

2. **Identifying a safe passage:**  We need to find a way around obstacles 1, 2, and 3.  Observing their positions, we can navigate around them by going to the right of obstacle 1.

3. **Adjusting the path:**
    * From (16.0, 1.0), move further right to a point clear of obstacle 1, like (19.0, 1.0).
    * Then, move upwards to a point clear of obstacles 2 and 3, for example (19.0, 19.0).
    * This allows us to connect to the final waypoint (19.0, 19.0) without intersecting any obstacles.
