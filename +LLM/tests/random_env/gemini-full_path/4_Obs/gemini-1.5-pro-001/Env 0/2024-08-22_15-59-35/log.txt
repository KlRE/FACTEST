# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[2.8, 16.7], [4.1, 16.0], [6.4, 19.2], [4.7, 18.5]]
			Obstacle 2: [[15.8, 1.7], [18.0, 6.5], [17.7, 13.5], [16.7, 11.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[5.2, 12.4], [11.0, 4.9], [17.0, 1.6], [13.7, 7.0]]
			Obstacle 4: [[3.1, 1.3], [12.6, 3.3], [12.1, 4.9], [7.0, 7.2]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [

        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

[08/22/2024 03:59:53 PM] The initial path intersects with obstacle 3 because it attempts to move directly from the start to the end set. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around the obstacles. 

Observing the layout, there's a clear path above all the obstacles. We can route the path above the highest point of all obstacles and then proceed towards the goal. 

Here's how we can adjust the path:

1. **Maintain Start:** Keep the starting point within the start set at (1.0, 1.0).
2. **Move Upwards:**  Proceed vertically to a y-coordinate greater than the highest point of all obstacles.  Examining the obstacle coordinates, the highest y-coordinate among all obstacles is 19.2 (Obstacle 1). Let's choose a y-coordinate of 20.0 for safety. This leads us to the waypoint (1.0, 20.0).
3. **Move Right:**  Move horizontally towards the goal set. Since our target endpoint has an x-coordinate within the range of the goal set, we can move right to the x-coordinate of 19.0, resulting in the waypoint (19.0, 20.0).
4. **Reach the Goal:** Finally, move downwards to reach the desired endpoint within the goal set at (19.0, 19.0).

Therefore, the adjusted path is as follows:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (1.0, 20.0), 
    (19.0, 20.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```
