# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.9, 14.3], [15.6, 6.0], [16.0, 3.9], [19.0, 3.3]]
			Obstacle 2: [[14.7, 14.7], [17.1, 11.9], [19.3, 15.9], [15.3, 17.6]]
			Obstacle 3: [[13.6, 19.3], [6.3, 16.0], [13.2, 16.0], [15.9, 16.8]]
			Obstacle 4: [[17.9, 15.8], [15.0, 15.0], [15.3, 13.1], [19.5, 11.1]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:07:58 PM] It seems like the obstacles are blocking the direct path to the goal. Let's break down the environment to find a safe path:

1. **Starting Point:** We can choose the top-right corner of the start set (2.0, 2.0) as our starting point. 

2. **Navigating Obstacles:**
    *  Obstacles 1, 2, and 4 create a wall-like structure on the right, making it impossible to go directly right.
    *  Obstacle 3 stretches horizontally above the start and partially blocks the upward path. However, there seems to be a gap between Obstacles 3 and 2.

3. **Towards the Goal:**
    * We can move upwards to navigate through the gap between Obstacles 3 and 2.
    * Once we are past Obstacle 3, we can safely move right towards the goal, as obstacles 2 and 4 are positioned lower.

**Path Proposal:**

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    // Start at the top-right corner of the start set
    (2.0, 17.0),   // Move upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 3
    (20.0, 17.0),  // Move right, safely past all obstacles
    (20.0, 19.0)   // Move down to the center of the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:08:05 PM] The initial path intersected with obstacles 2 and 3. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around these obstacles.

2. **Navigate Upwards:** Move vertically upwards to a point  (2.0, 12.0) to avoid the lower part of Obstacle 2. 

3. **Navigate Rightwards:**  Move horizontally to the right to a point (14.0, 12.0) staying clear of Obstacle 2.

4. **Navigate Upwards:** Move upwards to (14.0, 20.0) to clear the top of Obstacle 3. 

5. **Reach the Goal:** Move horizontally to the left, reaching the goal point at (20.0, 20.0).

Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:08:14 PM] The original path was trying to navigate through the obstacles, leading to multiple intersections. Instead, the path should be planned to go around the obstacles completely.

Starting at (2.0, 2.0), we can first move upwards to (2.0, 12.0). 
From there, instead of going right towards the obstacles, we can move further upwards to (2.0, 20.0).
This avoids all the obstacles as it goes around them from the top.
Finally, move right to reach the goal at (20.0, 20.0).

Here is the corrected path:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0), 
    (2.0, 12.0), 
    (2.0, 20.0), 
    (20.0, 20.0)
]
```
