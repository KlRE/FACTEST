# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[12.5, 14.1], [12.8, 11.4], [17.3, 18.1], [12.6, 17.7]]
			Obstacle 2: [[1.0, 19.5], [5.8, 16.4], [12.9, 16.6], [10.9, 19.2]]
			Obstacle 3: [[18.6, 8.2], [17.1, 5.7], [19.0, 6.0], [19.9, 7.0]]
			Obstacle 4: [[11.1, 19.9], [10.2, 16.5], [10.3, 16.2], [18.3, 12.3]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:09:35 PM] The provided obstacles create a sort of channel that leads from the start to the goal. Here's a possible path:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0),    # Start inside the start quadrilateral
    (6.0, 1.0),    # Move right, staying below obstacles
    (8.0, 5.0),    # Move diagonally up, navigating between obstacle clusters
    (10.0, 8.0),   # Continue moving diagonally, avoiding obstacle 4
    (14.0, 12.0),  # Navigate carefully around obstacle 1 
    (16.0, 16.0),  # Move towards the goal, staying clear of obstacles 2 and 4
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Arrive inside the goal quadrilateral
]
```

**Explanation:**

* The path starts by moving right to avoid the initial cluster of obstacles. 
* It then carefully ascends diagonally, exploiting the gaps between obstacles. 
* Finally, it approaches the goal from a diagonal direction to avoid any close calls with the obstacle edges.

**Important:**  This is a visual estimation.  To guarantee the path's safety, you would need to perform precise geometric calculations to ensure no segment intersects any obstacle.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:09:41 PM] The feedback indicates that the segment between (14.0, 12.0) and (16.0, 16.0) intersects with Obstacle 4. Looking at the coordinates, it seems like going through the right side of obstacle 4 would be a better choice. So instead of directly going to (16.0, 16.0), we can add a waypoint to the right of obstacle 4 and then proceed towards the goal.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [(2.0, 1.0), (6.0, 1.0), (8.0, 5.0), (10.0, 8.0), (14.0, 12.0), (18.5, 12.5), (16.0, 16.0), (19.0, 19.0)]
```

By adding the waypoint (18.5, 12.5), the path now goes around Obstacle 4, avoiding the intersection.

[08/22/2024 04:09:48 PM] The feedback indicates that the segment between (14.0, 12.0) and (18.5, 12.5) intersects with Obstacle 4. Looking at the coordinates of Obstacle 4, it seems the path attempts to cross the obstacle horizontally. 

To avoid this, we can adjust the path to go above Obstacle 4. We can do this by adding a waypoint before (18.5, 12.5) that sits above Obstacle 4 and still allows for a straight line to the goal.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [(2.0, 1.0), (6.0, 1.0), (8.0, 5.0), (10.0, 8.0), (14.0, 12.0), (16.0, 16.0), (18.5, 16.0), (19.0, 19.0)] 
```

Changes:

- Added a waypoint at (18.5, 16.0) which is above Obstacle 4. This allows a straight line from (14.0, 12.0) to avoid the obstacle and then continue to the goal.
- Removed the waypoint (16.0, 16.0) as it's no longer needed to navigate around the obstacle.

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:09:53 PM] The path intersects with Obstacle 4 because it attempts to move directly diagonally across the environment. To avoid this, we can adjust the path to first move to the right, clearing the obstacle, and then upwards.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0), 
    (6.0, 1.0), 
    (8.0, 5.0), 
    (10.0, 8.0), 
    (14.0, 8.0),  # Move right instead of directly towards the goal
    (16.0, 12.0), # Now move upwards, clear of Obstacle 4
    (18.5, 16.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[12.5, 14.1], [12.8, 11.4], [17.3, 18.1], [12.6, 17.7]]
			Obstacle 2: [[1.0, 19.5], [5.8, 16.4], [12.9, 16.6], [10.9, 19.2]]
			Obstacle 3: [[18.6, 8.2], [17.1, 5.7], [19.0, 6.0], [19.9, 7.0]]
			Obstacle 4: [[11.1, 19.9], [10.2, 16.5], [10.3, 16.2], [18.3, 12.3]]

    
## Your generated path:
    path = [(2.0, 1.0), (6.0, 1.0), (8.0, 5.0), (10.0, 8.0), (14.0, 8.0), (16.0, 12.0), (18.5, 16.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    Obstacle Avoidance (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
		Segment 6 between points (16.0, 12.0) and (18.5, 16.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 4: [[11.1, 19.9], [10.2, 16.5], [10.3, 16.2], [18.3, 12.3]]
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

[08/22/2024 04:10:05 PM] The feedback indicates that the segment connecting (16.0, 12.0) and (18.5, 16.0) intersects with Obstacle 4.  To address this, we need to adjust the path to navigate around Obstacle 4.

Observing the environment, we can see that Obstacle 4 is situated in the upper-right quadrant of the path's intended trajectory.  We can guide the path to move below Obstacle 4. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0), 
    (6.0, 1.0), 
    (8.0, 5.0), 
    (10.0, 8.0), 
    (14.0, 8.0), 
    (16.0, 11.0),  # Adjusted this waypoint to be lower than Obstacle 4
    (18.5, 11.0),  # Added this waypoint to guide the path around Obstacle 4
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

By lowering the y-coordinate of the sixth waypoint and introducing a seventh waypoint, we create a path segment that goes around Obstacle 4, thus avoiding the intersection.
