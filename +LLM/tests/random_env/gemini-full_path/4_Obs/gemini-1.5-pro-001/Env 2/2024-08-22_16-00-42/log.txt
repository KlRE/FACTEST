# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[17.8, 20.0], [11.9, 14.6], [14.3, 13.0], [16.2, 14.5]]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.

[08/22/2024 04:00:53 PM] The initial path went too directly towards the goal, colliding with multiple obstacles.  To rectify this, the path needs to navigate around the obstacles more carefully.

1. **Initial Path Analysis:**  The feedback indicated that segments 3 and 4 of the initial path crossed obstacles. This tells us we need to adjust the path to go around these obstacles. 

2. **Identifying Safe Zones:**  By looking at the obstacle coordinates, we can see that:
    - There's a relatively clear vertical corridor to the right of obstacles 2 and 3, leading upwards.
    -  The goal set is open from the top.

3. **Revised Path Strategy:**
    -  From the start point, move upward, similar to the initial path, but aim further to the right to avoid obstacle 3. 
    - Once safely past obstacles 2 and 3, continue moving upward until we're above all obstacles.
    -  Finally, move directly left to enter the goal set.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    
    (1.0, 12.0),   
    (13.0, 12.0),   
    (13.0, 20.0),  
    (19.0, 20.0)

[08/22/2024 04:01:11 PM] The original path collides with obstacles 1, 2 and 3. To avoid this, we can adjust the path to go around these obstacles.

1. **Starting Point:** We can keep the same starting point (1.0, 1.0).
2. **Avoiding Obstacles 2 and 3:** Instead of moving horizontally at y=12.0, we can move to a point with a higher y-coordinate to avoid both Obstacle 2 and 3. Let's choose (1.0, 17.0).
3. **Navigating to the Goal:** From (1.0, 17.0), we can move horizontally to the right, avoiding Obstacle 1, until we reach a point directly above the goal set, such as (19.0, 17.0).
4. **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, we can move downwards to reach the goal point (19.0, 19.0).

This results in the following path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (1.0, 17.0), 
    (19.0, 17.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0) 
]
```

This new path avoids all obstacles and successfully connects the start and goal sets.

    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:01:18 PM] The initial path intersects with obstacles because it attempts to go straight across, encountering Obstacles 2, 3, and 1 in the process. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate a less congested route.  

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Start:** (1.0, 1.0) - This starting point is within the start set.

2. **Move Up:** (1.0, 7.0) - This avoids Obstacles 2 and 3 completely.

3. **Move Right:** (17.0, 7.0) - We travel horizontally, staying clear of all obstacles.

4. **Move Up:** (17.0, 19.0) - We safely approach the goal set.

5. **Move Right (Goal):** (19.0, 19.0) - Reaching our destination within the goal set.

Therefore, the updated path is as follows:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  
    (1.0, 7.0),  
    (17.0, 7.0),  
    (17.0, 19.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

[08/22/2024 04:01:25 PM] The initial path went straight upwards at x=17, colliding with obstacles 1 and 4. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around these obstacles.

1. **Initial Part:** The segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (1.0, 7.0) is safe and can be kept.

2. **Navigating Obstacles:** Instead of going straight up to y=19, we need to navigate around obstacles 1 and 4. We can do this by moving rightwards towards x=10, staying below obstacle 3, then moving upwards to get above obstacles 1 and 4.

3. **Final Stretch:**  Once above the obstacles, we can move rightwards and then downwards towards the goal set.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   
    (1.0, 7.0),  
    (10.0, 7.0),  # Move rightwards below obstacle 3

[08/22/2024 04:01:30 PM] The initial path goes through obstacles 2 and 3.  To fix this, the path needs to be adjusted to go around these obstacles. 

First, instead of going straight up from the start, the path can be adjusted to move to the right, avoiding obstacle 3 entirely. 

Next, to avoid obstacle 2, we can route the path above it. 

Finally, the path can then proceed towards the goal.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start point
    (5.0, 1.0),   # Move right, avoiding obstacle 3
    (5.0, 20.0),  # Move up, clearing obstacle 2
    (19.0, 20.0), # Move right towards the goal
