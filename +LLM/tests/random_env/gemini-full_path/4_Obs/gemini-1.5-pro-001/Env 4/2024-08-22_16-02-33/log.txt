# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[7.2, 18.1], [7.7, 15.8], [14.3, 10.2], [14.0, 16.7]]
			Obstacle 2: [[19.5, 5.7], [15.3, 9.0], [16.1, 6.6], [18.2, 5.7]]
			Obstacle 3: [[6.1, 17.9], [12.6, 15.3], [17.6, 15.7], [12.2, 16.9]]
			Obstacle 4: [[10.4, 2.8], [18.4, 4.4], [15.4, 9.7], [10.5, 14.2]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.

        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

]

[08/22/2024 04:02:46 PM] The original path intersected with obstacles 3 and 4. To avoid this, we can adjust the path as follows:

1. **Avoiding Obstacle 4:** Instead of going straight from (5.0, 1.0) to (5.0, 10.0), we can route the path around the bottom of obstacle 4. 
2. **Avoiding Obstacle 3:**  We can then proceed upward, staying to the right of obstacle 3, before moving towards the goal.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start Point
    (5.0, 1.0),    # Move right
    (9.0, 1.0),    # Move further right, staying clear of Obstacle 4
    (9.0, 6.0),    # Move upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 4
    (13.0, 6.0),   # Move right, preparing to go around Obstacle 3
    (13.0, 17.0),  # Move upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 3 
    (16.0, 17.0),  # Move right towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End Point 
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles while staying within the defined start and goal sets.

[08/22/2024 04:03:15 PM] The path needs adjustments to avoid obstacles:

1. **Segment 4:** (9.0, 6.0) to (13.0, 6.0) crosses Obstacle 4. To fix this, we can route the path upwards before Obstacle 4, and then continue rightwards. 
2. **Segment 5:** (13.0, 6.0) to (13.0, 17.0) crosses Obstacles 1, 3, and 4.  We already addressed the conflict with Obstacle 4 in the previous step. To avoid Obstacles 1 and 3, the path needs to navigate around them. Since the path is already to the right of Obstacle 4, it's more efficient to go around Obstacles 1 and 3 on the right side.

Considering these points, the adjusted path would be:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),        # Start
    (5.0, 1.0),        # Continue right
    (9.0, 1.0),        # Continue right
    (9.0, 12.0),       # Move up, clearing Obstacle 4
    (15.0, 12.0),      # Move right, clearing Obstacle 1 & 3 
    (15.0, 17.0),      # Move up
    (16.0, 17.0),      # Continue right
    (19.0, 19.0)       # End

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:03:23 PM] The original path collides with obstacles 1 and 4. To fix this, the path needs to navigate around these obstacles. 

1. **Addressing Obstacle 4:** The segment (9.0, 1.0) to (9.0, 12.0) goes right through obstacle 4. Instead, the path can move rightwards towards the right edge of obstacle 4 before moving upwards.

2. **Addressing Obstacle 1:** The segment (9.0, 12.0) to (15.0, 12.0) collides with both obstacles 1 and 4. Since we're already navigating around obstacle 4, we can adjust the path to go above obstacle 1. 

Here is a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start point
    (5.0, 1.0),   # Move right
    (10.5, 1.0),  # Move right, aligning with the right edge of obstacle 4 
    (10.5, 14.5), # Move up, staying clear above obstacle 4
    (15.0, 14.5), # Move right, staying clear above obstacle 1
    (15.0, 17.0), # Continue on original path
    (16.0, 17.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End point
]

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.

]

[08/22/2024 04:03:31 PM] The initial path attempts to move right and then upwards, leading to collisions with obstacles 1 and 4. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around these obstacles. 

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Initial Movement:**  Keep the initial segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (5.0, 1.0) as it remains clear.
2. **Navigating Obstacle 4:** Instead of moving straight up at x = 10.5, guide the path around obstacle 4. A possible waypoint could be (5.0, 6.0). This keeps the path clear of obstacle 4's upper boundary.
3. **Approaching Obstacle 1:** From (5.0, 6.0), the path needs to navigate above obstacle 1. A safe waypoint could be (7.0, 18.5) ensuring a safe distance from obstacle 1.
4. **Continuing to the Goal:** From (7.0, 18.5), the path has a clear route to the goal. A direct movement to (19.0, 19.0) avoids all obstacles.

Therefore, a revised path could be:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (5.0, 1.0), 
    (5.0, 6.0), 
    (7.0, 18.5), 
    (19.0, 19.0)
] 
```

This path avoids all known obstacles while successfully connecting the start and goal sets.
