# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[18.9, 12.3], [6.5, 2.5], [7.1, 2.0], [14.7, 3.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[12.7, 10.4], [19.9, 11.6], [15.7, 18.3], [14.6, 18.9]]
			Obstacle 3: [[17.8, 13.7], [13.8, 9.5], [14.3, 6.6], [18.0, 1.6]]
			Obstacle 4: [[11.1, 5.3], [19.1, 9.0], [14.1, 13.9], [12.4, 14.8]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:14:52 PM] The initial path goes straight horizontally from (1.0, 15.0) to (19.0, 15.0). This intersects with Obstacle 2, which occupies a range of y-values roughly from 10.4 to 18.9 at those x-values. To avoid this, the path needs to detour around this obstacle.

One way to do this is to route the path above Obstacle 2. Since the obstacle doesn't extend beyond a y-value of around 18.9, we can route the path at a y-value of 19.0. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start point
    (1.0, 19.0),  # Move vertically up, staying clear of Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Move horizontally to the goal set
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles:

* It starts within the start set.
* The first segment goes vertically, staying clear of all obstacles.
* The second segment goes horizontally above all obstacles, reaching the goal set.
