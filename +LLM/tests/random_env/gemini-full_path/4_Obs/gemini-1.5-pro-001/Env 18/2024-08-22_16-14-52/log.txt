# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[10.9, 17.9], [2.2, 16.6], [3.7, 13.1], [7.2, 10.6]]
			Obstacle 2: [[17.0, 18.9], [15.2, 16.3], [17.9, 13.0], [19.3, 13.4]]
			Obstacle 3: [[16.9, 19.2], [15.3, 8.0], [16.3, 11.5], [17.5, 16.2]]
			Obstacle 4: [[0.4, 17.7], [5.3, 17.2], [9.0, 18.7], [1.0, 17.9]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.

    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:15:01 PM] A viable path can be visualized by imagining a diagonal line connecting the bottom-left corner of the start set to the top-right corner of the goal set.  We need to adjust this line to avoid obstacles.

* **Start:** (2.0, 0.0) - bottom-right corner of the start set.
* **Waypoint 1:** (10.0, 10.0) - This point sits comfortably below and to the right of obstacles 1 and 4.
* **Waypoint 2:** (14.0, 17.0) - Carefully positioned above obstacle 1 and to the left of obstacle 2. 
* **Waypoint 3:** (17.5, 19.0) -  This places us just above obstacle 3 and to the left of obstacle 2.
* **End:** (20.0, 20.0) -  Top-right corner of the goal set.

Therefore, a possible path is:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 0.0),
    (10.0, 10.0),
    (14.0, 17.0),
    (17.5, 19.0),
    (20.0, 20.0)
]
```

**Important:** This is just a visual estimation. It's crucial to verify this path mathematically to ensure it maintains a safe distance from all obstacles.

]

[08/22/2024 04:15:06 PM] The initial path goes too far to the south and intersects with obstacles 2 and 3.  It needs to be adjusted to steer clear of these obstacles.

To avoid the obstacles, the path can be modified to pass to the north of obstacles 2 and 3. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 0.0),  # Starting point
    (10.0, 10.0),  # Intermediate waypoint 
    (10.0, 20.0), # Move vertically to clear obstacles
    (20.0, 20.0)   # End point in the goal set
]
```

This new path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles:

* It starts within the start set.
* It goes around obstacle 1 by first moving diagonally and then vertically.
* It avoids obstacles 2 and 3 by moving vertically to the north.
* It ends within the goal set.

[08/22/2024 04:15:14 PM] The initial path went directly upwards from (10.0, 10.0) to (10.0, 20.0), intersecting Obstacle 1. To avoid this, we need to route the path around this obstacle.

Here's a possible approach:

1. **From the start point (2.0, 0.0):** We can keep the first waypoint as (10.0, 10.0) as it lies outside any obstacle.
2. **Navigating around Obstacle 1:** Instead of going straight up, we can guide the path to the right of Obstacle 1. A waypoint at (14.0, 10.0) would achieve this.
3. **Clear path to the goal:** From (14.0, 10.0), we can move directly upwards to (14.0, 20.0), as there are no obstacles in this path.
4. **Reaching the goal:** Finally, move horizontally to the left and reach the goal set with the waypoint (20.0, 20.0).

Therefore, the adjusted path would be:

```
new_path = [
    (10.0, 10.0),  
    (14.0, 10.0),  
    (14.0, 20.0),

[08/22/2024 04:15:19 PM] The previous path starts at an incorrect location. It needs to start within the start set [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]. Additionally, the path can be made more efficient.

The path can start within the start set and move directly towards the goal set, navigating below Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2. Obstacle 3 does not need to be considered because it is too far to the right. This strategy provides a more efficient path compared to the previous attempt.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[10.9, 17.9], [2.2, 16.6], [3.7, 13.1], [7.2, 10.6]]
			Obstacle 2: [[17.0, 18.9], [15.2, 16.3], [17.9, 13.0], [19.3, 13.4]]
			Obstacle 3: [[16.9, 19.2], [15.3, 8.0], [16.3, 11.5], [17.5, 16.2]]
			Obstacle 4: [[0.4, 17.7], [5.3, 17.2], [9.0, 18.7], [1.0, 17.9]]

    
## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.0, 1.0), (10.0, 10.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.

		Segment 2 between points (10.0, 10.0) and (19.0, 19.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 2: [[17.0, 18.9], [15.2, 16.3], [17.9, 13.0], [19.3, 13.4]]
			Obstacle 3: [[16.9, 19.2], [15.3, 8.0], [16.3, 11.5], [17.5, 16.2]]
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:15:23 PM] The original path cuts through obstacles 2 and 3. To avoid this, we can route the path below these obstacles.

- From the starting point (1.0, 1.0), we can move south to a point below the obstacles.
- Then, we can move east, staying below the obstacles.
- Finally, we can move north to reach the goal set.

This strategy ensures that the path remains clear of all obstacles.

Here's the updated path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  
    (1.0, 7.0), 
    (19.0, 7.0),
    (19.0, 19.0) 
]

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 04:15:31 PM] The issue is that the straight line connecting (1.0, 7.0) and (19.0, 19.0) cuts through Obstacle 2. 

To fix this, we can adjust the path to go around this obstacle. Since the obstacle is located towards the top-right corner, we can route the path by first moving right and then upwards:

1. **Keep the first two waypoints:**  (1.0, 1.0) and (1.0, 7.0) remain as they are. 
2. **Move right, staying clear of obstacles:**  Instead of going directly to (19.0, 7.0), let's move rightwards to (17.0, 7.0). This stays clear of all obstacles.
3. **Move upwards to the goal:** From (17.0, 7.0), we can now move upwards to reach the goal region, for example at (17.0, 19.0). 
4. **Enter the goal set:** Finally, move from (17.0, 19.0) to a point within the goal set, such as (19.0, 19.0)

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (1.0, 7.0), 
    (17.0, 7.0), 
    (17.0, 19.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
