# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[10.4, 13.8], [14.7, 9.7], [20.0, 13.3], [10.5, 15.0]]

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:40:22 PM] The problematic segment connects (15.0, 7.0) to (19.0, 19.0), cutting through Obstacle 1. To circumvent this, we can route the path around the obstacle. 

Observing the layout, we can guide the path above Obstacle 1. Here's how:

1. **Maintain the first two waypoints:** (1.0, 1.0) and (8.0, 1.0) are fine.

2. **Navigate above Obstacle 1:** Instead of directly going to (15.0, 7.0), let's take the path above Obstacle 1.  A waypoint like (12.0, 16.0) places us safely above the obstacle.

3. **Proceed towards the goal:** From (12.0, 16.0), we can move towards the goal, for instance, to (19.0, 19.0).

Therefore, a corrected path could be:

```
new_path = [(1.0, 1.0), (8.0, 1.0), (12.0, 16.0), (19.0, 19.0)] 
```

This revised path avoids collision with Obstacle 1 while successfully connecting the start and goal regions.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:40:30 PM] The original path collides with Obstacle 1 because it attempts to move directly to the right and then upwards. This strategy fails because it does not account for the position of Obstacle 1. To circumvent this, the path needs to initially navigate around Obstacle 1 before proceeding towards the goal.

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Start:** Begin at a suitable point within the start set, such as (1.0, 1.0).
2. **Navigate Below Obstacle 1:** Move downwards to a point with a y-coordinate less than the minimum y-coordinate of Obstacle 1. For instance, we can move to (1.0, 6.0). 
3. **Move Right:** Proceed horizontally to the right, staying clear of Obstacle 1. A possible waypoint could be (16.0, 6.0).
4. **Ascend to Goal:** Finally, move upwards to reach a point within the goal set, such as (19.0, 19.0).

This strategy avoids collision with Obstacle 1 by first going below it before moving towards the goal. 

Here's the revised path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (1.0, 6.0), 
    (16.0, 6.0),

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:40:36 PM] The provided path goes too far to the right and gets trapped on the wrong side of Obstacle 1.  We can fix this by routing the path between Obstacles 1 and 2.

Here's a possible corrected path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start inside the start set
    (1.0, 7.0),    # Move upwards, giving a wide berth above Obstacle 1
    (16.0, 7.0),   # Move right, staying above Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move to the goal within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Initial Upward Movement:** Instead of moving horizontally first, the path starts by moving vertically upwards to a point  `(1.0, 7.0)`. This ensures a safe distance from Obstacle 1.

2. **Horizontal Movement:** From this higher position, the path then moves horizontally rightwards to `(16.0, 7.0)`, staying clear of both obstacles.

3. **Final Approach:** The path can then safely move towards the goal set without encountering any obstacles.

    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[10.4, 13.8], [14.7, 9.7], [20.0, 13.3], [10.5, 15.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[17.6, 6.4], [19.4, 6.3], [19.0, 8.1], [18.3, 11.1]]

    
## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.0, 1.0), (1.0, 7.0), (16.0, 7.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    Obstacle Avoidance (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
		Segment 3 between points (16.0, 7.0) and (19.0, 19.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 1: [[10.4, 13.8], [14.7, 9.7], [20.0, 13.3], [10.5, 15.0]]
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:40:43 PM] The original path's segment between (16.0, 7.0) and (19.0, 19.0) crosses Obstacle 1. To avoid this, we can route the path below Obstacle 1.

1. **Maintain Initial Segment:** The segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (1.0, 7.0) is valid and can be kept.

2. **Navigate Below Obstacle 1:** Instead of going directly towards the goal, extend the path horizontally to the right, staying below Obstacle 1. A suitable waypoint could be (16.0, 7.0). 

3. **Vertical Movement:**  From (16.0, 7.0), move vertically downward to a point that allows for a clear path to the goal set. A suitable waypoint could be (16.0, 5.0).

4. **Reach the Goal Set:**  Finally, move horizontally towards the goal set. A suitable endpoint inside the goal set is (19.0, 19.0).

Therefore, a corrected path is:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (1.0, 7.0),
    (16.0, 7.0),
    (16.0, 5.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

[08/22/2024 03:41:09 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 1. Analyzing the position of the obstacle, we can see that navigating below it is a viable option. 

Instead of going up then right, the path can be modified to go right, then down, and finally up to the goal position. This approach avoids crossing Obstacle 1 while remaining within the bounds of the start and goal sets.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 1.0),    # Move right, staying below Obstacle 1 
    (9.0, 5.0),    # Move down, staying clear of Obstacle 1's bottom right corner
    (19.0, 5.0),   # Move right, staying below Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move up to the goal position 
]
