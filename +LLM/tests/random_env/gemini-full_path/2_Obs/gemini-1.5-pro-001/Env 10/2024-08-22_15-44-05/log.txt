# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[3.0, 15.1], [14.5, 6.4], [10.1, 11.7], [4.6, 15.6]]
			Obstacle 2: [[10.3, 14.0], [15.0, 9.3], [18.7, 8.6], [16.9, 10.1]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:44:11 PM] The provided obstacles create a channel that leads from the start to the goal area.  The path can utilize this channel to avoid collisions.

**Path Analysis:**

1. **Starting Point:** Choose (1.0, 1.0) within the start quadrilateral.
2. **Move Upwards:** Navigate vertically to (1.0, 15.0), staying within the channel formed by the obstacles. 
3. **Move Rightwards:**  Proceed horizontally towards the goal, reaching (19.0, 15.0).
4. **Move Downwards:** Finally, descend vertically to (19.0, 19.0), which lies within the goal quadrilateral.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (1.0, 15.0),
    (19.0, 15.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]

[08/22/2024 03:44:23 PM] The initial path goes straight through obstacle 1. To fix this, we can route the path around the top of obstacle 1 and then continue towards the goal.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start inside the start set
    (1.0, 16.0),   # Move upwards, clearing obstacle 1's highest point
    (19.0, 16.0),  # Move rightwards, staying above obstacle 1
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move downwards to reach the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(1.0, 1.0):** We begin within the start set.
2. **(1.0, 16.0):** We move vertically upwards to a point higher than the topmost point of obstacle 1.
3. **(19.0, 16.0):** From this elevated position, we can safely move horizontally to the right, staying clear of obstacle 1.
4. **(19.0, 19.0):** Finally, we move downwards to enter the goal set.
