# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[18.9, 14.3], [10.9, 13.2], [12.7, 1.9], [18.6, 12.1]]
			Obstacle 2: [[1.2, 16.1], [10.2, 15.4], [12.8, 17.5], [10.9, 17.5]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:41:42 PM] The provided obstacles create a channel that the path can follow. 

* Starting from within the start set, the path can move up avoiding Obstacle 2. 
* Then, the path can progress rightward, staying within the channel created by the obstacles. 
* Finally, upon reaching a point approximately horizontally aligned with the goal set, the path can turn and move towards the goal, successfully navigating to the goal set without intersecting any obstacles.

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start set
    (1.0, 17.0),  # Move upward, staying clear of Obstacle 2
    (15.0, 17.0),  # Move rightward within the channel
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move to a point within the goal set
]
```

[08/22/2024 03:42:01 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 2. The problematic segment is between (1.0, 17.0) and (15.0, 17.0). 

To circumvent this, we can route the path around the left side of Obstacle 2. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (1.0, 17.0),   # Move upwards, same as before
    (0.0, 17.0),   # Move slightly to the left to avoid Obstacle 2 
    (0.0, 21.0),   # Move upwards, clear of Obstacle 2
    (15.0, 21.0),  # Move rightwards, staying clear of obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move down into the goal set
]
```

This path first moves up as before but then takes a detour to the left and upwards to completely bypass Obstacle 2. It then proceeds rightward and finally downward to the goal.
