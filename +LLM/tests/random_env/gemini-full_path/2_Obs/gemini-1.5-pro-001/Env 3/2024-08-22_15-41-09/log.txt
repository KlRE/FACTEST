# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[12.2, 19.2], [17.9, 6.3], [19.4, 12.0], [14.2, 18.2]]

[08/22/2024 03:41:30 PM] The original path crosses obstacle 1 because it attempts to move horizontally across the entire environment. The obstacles present a significant barrier to this approach. Therefore, the path needs to navigate around the obstacles more carefully. 

Observing the environment, we can see that a viable path exists by first moving vertically, then horizontally, and finally vertically again to reach the goal.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (1.0, 8.0),    # Move vertically upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 2
    (17.0, 8.0),   # Move horizontally towards the goal, staying below Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move vertically upwards to reach the goal within the goal set
]
```

This path avoids crossing any obstacles by navigating around them in a way that respects their boundaries.

[08/22/2024 03:41:37 PM] The initial path intersects with Obstacle 1 because it attempts to move directly from left to right without accounting for the obstacle's position. To circumvent this, we can adjust the path to initially move upwards, clearing the obstacle, before proceeding towards the goal. 

Here's how we can adjust the path:

1. **Initial Upward Movement:**  Instead of going directly right from (1.0, 8.0), we need to navigate above Obstacle 1. A safe point to aim for is above the obstacle's highest y-coordinate. Let's choose (1.0, 20.0).

2. **Horizontal Movement:**  From (1.0, 20.0), we can safely move horizontally towards the goal. A suitable waypoint would be (17.0, 20.0), aligning with the goal's x-coordinate.

3. **Final Descent:** Finally, descend directly from (17.0, 20.0) to a point within the goal set, like (19.0, 19.0).

Therefore, the revised path is:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (1.0, 20.0), 
    (17.0, 20.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```
