# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[7.7, 13.5], [0.2, 3.8], [11.7, 3.4], [14.6, 10.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.2, 20.0], [5.8, 15.8], [10.1, 17.5], [4.1, 19.6]]

[08/22/2024 03:46:26 PM] The initial path segment crosses Obstacle 1 because it attempts to move directly upwards in the y-direction. To avoid this, the path needs to first navigate around Obstacle 1 before heading towards the goal.

Here's how we can adjust the path:

1. **Starting Point:** We can keep the starting point at (1.0, 1.0) as it lies within the start set.
2. **Navigating Around Obstacle 1:** 
    * Instead of moving straight up, we can first move rightwards, increasing the x-coordinate while keeping the y-coordinate constant. This allows us to clear the x-range of Obstacle 1.
    * Once we are past the x-range of Obstacle 1, we can then safely move upwards in the y-direction, avoiding any intersection. 
3. **Approaching the Goal:**
    * With Obstacle 1 cleared, we can now move towards the goal. A direct path towards the goal now does not intersect with any obstacles.

Considering these adjustments, here's a possible path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start Point
    (12.0, 1.0),  # Move right, clearing Obstacle 1's x-range
    (12.0, 19.0), # Move upwards, clearing Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move right to reach the goal set
] 
```

This path ensures that all segments are valid and do not intersect with any obstacles, successfully navigating from the start set to the goal set.

[08/22/2024 03:46:31 PM] The initial path intersects with Obstacle 1 because it attempts to go directly upwards to y=19.0 before moving to the goal. 

To avoid this, we can route the path around the right side of Obstacle 1. We can do this by first moving rightwards, clearing the x-coordinate of Obstacle 1, then upwards, clearing the y-coordinate of Obstacle 1, and finally moving towards the goal.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (16.0, 1.0),   # Move rightwards, clearing Obstacle 1's x-coordinate
    (16.0, 20.0),  # Move upwards, clearing Obstacle 1's y-coordinate
