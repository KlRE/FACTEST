# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[19.8, 12.4], [15.7, 13.5], [18.3, 1.8], [19.1, 4.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[13.9, 19.4], [5.3, 16.0], [17.8, 10.0], [18.1, 12.8]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

[08/22/2024 03:45:10 PM] The provided obstacles create a channel that narrows as it approaches the goal. To navigate this, the path should stay to the right side of the channel.

1. **Start:** (2.0, 1.0) - The right edge of the start quadrilateral provides a direct path into the channel.
2. **Waypoint 1:** (16.0, 6.0) - This waypoint moves the path into the channel while staying clear of Obstacle 1.
3. **Waypoint 2:** (18.5, 15.0) - This waypoint navigates around the corner of Obstacle 2, maintaining a safe distance.
4. **End:** (19.0, 19.0) - The path ends at the left edge of the goal quadrilateral, safely within the goal set.

Therefore, the path would be:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0),    
    (16.0, 6.0),   
    (18.5, 15.0),

[08/22/2024 03:45:15 PM] The original path crosses both obstacles. To fix this, the path needs to navigate around the obstacles. A viable option is to route the path below both obstacles. 

Starting from (2.0, 1.0), the path can move downwards to stay clear of Obstacle 1. A waypoint at (2.0, -1.0) positions the path for a safe horizontal movement. 

Then, the path can move rightwards, steering clear of both obstacles. A waypoint at (16.0, -1.0) positions the path well for the final leg.

Finally, the path can move upwards towards the goal set, reaching a suitable entry point at (19.0, 19.0).

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0), 
    (2.0, -1.0), 
    (16.0, -1.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)

[08/22/2024 03:45:22 PM] The original path's third segment cuts through both obstacles. To correct this, we can route the path around the obstacles. 

1. **Starting Point:**  Keep the starting point at (2.0, 1.0).

2. **Navigate around Obstacle 1:** Instead of going straight down, let's guide the path above Obstacle 1. A waypoint at (2.0, 14.0) achieves this.

3. **Navigate around Obstacle 2:** From the previous waypoint, we need to navigate around Obstacle 2.  A waypoint at (4.0, 14.0) moves us clear of Obstacle 1.  Then continue rightward with a waypoint at (16.0, 14.0) This puts us in a good position to head towards the goal.

4. **Reach the Goal:** Finally, connect to the goal set with a waypoint at (19.0, 19.0).

    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate

[08/22/2024 03:45:28 PM] The previous path was crossing obstacle 2. To avoid this, we can adjust the path to go around obstacle 2. 

1.  **Starting Point:** We can keep the same starting point (2.0, 1.0).

2.  **Navigating Obstacles:** Instead of going straight up and over, we can navigate around obstacle 2. A possible route is to first move right, then upwards, and finally move left towards the goal. 

3.  **New Waypoints:** Based on the above strategy, here's a possible set of waypoints:

    ```
    new_path = [
        (2.0, 1.0),   # Start
        (4.0, 1.0),   # Move right
        (4.0, 15.0),  # Move up, clearing Obstacle 2
        (19.0, 15.0), # Move right towards the goal 
        (19.0, 19.0)   # End 
    ]
    ```

This new path avoids intersecting with any of the obstacles and successfully connects the start and goal sets.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[19.8, 12.4], [15.7, 13.5], [18.3, 1.8], [19.1, 4.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[13.9, 19.4], [5.3, 16.0], [17.8, 10.0], [18.1, 12.8]]

    
## Your generated path:
    path = [(2.0, 1.0), (4.0, 1.0), (4.0, 15.0), (19.0, 15.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    Obstacle Avoidance (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
		Segment 3 between points (4.0, 15.0) and (19.0, 15.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 2: [[13.9, 19.4], [5.3, 16.0], [17.8, 10.0], [18.1, 12.8]]
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:45:37 PM] The original path intersected with Obstacle 2 because it attempted to move directly horizontally from (4.0, 15.0) to (19.0, 15.0). To avoid this, we can adjust the path to navigate around Obstacle 2.

First, notice that the horizontal line y=15 intersects Obstacle 2. We need to find a new y-value that allows us to pass above or below this obstacle. Observing the coordinates of Obstacle 2, we can see that a y-value above 19.4 would allow us to clear the obstacle entirely.

Therefore, we can adjust the path as follows:

1. **Keep the first three waypoints:** (2.0, 1.0), (4.0, 1.0), (4.0, 15.0)
2. **Adjust the fourth waypoint to move above Obstacle 2:** (4.0, 20.0)
3. **Add a waypoint to move horizontally towards the goal:** (19.0, 20.0)
4. **Keep the final waypoint inside the goal set:** (19.0, 19.0)

This new path avoids all obstacles while still staying within the start and goal sets.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0), 
    (4.0, 1.0), 
    (4.0, 15.0), 
    (4.0, 20.0),
    (19.0, 20.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```
