# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[7.3, 18.1], [12.1, 16.7], [17.7, 19.8], [7.4, 19.2]]
			Obstacle 2: [[10.8, -0.0], [19.7, 0.1], [18.1, 14.4], [11.0, 4.7]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:39:22 PM] The path can be planned by initially moving upwards, avoiding the left side of Obstacle 1, then navigating above Obstacle 1 and finally moving towards the goal, staying clear of Obstacle 2.

]

[08/22/2024 03:39:28 PM] The initial path crosses obstacle 2 twice. To avoid this, we can route the path around the obstacle. 

1. **Starting Point:** We keep the starting point (1.0, 1.0) as it is within the start set.

2. **Navigating Around Obstacle 2:** Instead of going directly to (1.0, 10.0), we need to maneuver around obstacle 2. A possible route is:
    - Move to the right, increasing the x-coordinate while keeping the y-coordinate low to stay below obstacle 2. A suitable waypoint could be (6.0, 1.0). 
    -  From there, move upwards, increasing the y-coordinate to get above obstacle 2. We could target a point like (6.0, 15.0), which is well clear of obstacle 2.

3. **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, we can proceed towards the goal set.  

Therefore, a corrected path could be:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (6.0, 1.0),  
    (6.0, 15.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)

[08/22/2024 03:40:08 PM] The original path intersected with Obstacle 1 because it went directly from a point below the obstacle to a point above and to the right.  To avoid this, we can route the path around the left side of Obstacle 1.  

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (6.0, 1.0),   # Move right, staying clear of obstacles
    (6.0, 15.0),  # Move upwards, staying to the left of Obstacle 1
    (6.0, 20.0),  # Continue upwards to a point above Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 20.0)  # Move right to the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(1.0, 1.0) to (6.0, 1.0):** This segment moves horizontally to the right, staying clear of any obstacles.
2. **(6.0, 1.0) to (6.0, 15.0):** This segment moves vertically upwards, ensuring it stays to the left of Obstacle 1.
3. **(6.0, 15.0) to (6.0, 20.0):** This segment continues moving upwards, passing above the top vertex of Obstacle 1.
4. **(6.0, 20.0) to (19.0, 20.0):** Finally, this segment moves horizontally to the right, reaching the goal set without intersecting any obstacles.
