# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:42:14 PM] The path intersects with Obstacle 2 because waypoint (10.0, 14.0) is positioned on the left side of the obstacle while the next waypoint (19.0, 16.0) is on its right side. To avoid this, we need to guide the path around Obstacle 2. 

Observing the environment, we can see a clear path above Obstacle 2. Therefore, we can adjust the path to navigate above this obstacle.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0),   # Start point (unchanged)
    (9.0, 16.0),  # Waypoint before Obstacle 2 (unchanged)
    (9.0, 17.0),  # New waypoint above Obstacle 2 
    (19.0, 17.0), # New waypoint above Obstacle 2 
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point (unchanged)
]
```

This new path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles:

1. It starts within the start set.
2. It navigates to (9.0, 16.0), staying clear of obstacles.
3. Instead of crossing Obstacle 2, it moves upward to (9.0, 17.0), staying above the obstacle.
4. It proceeds rightward to (19.0, 17.0), remaining above Obstacle 2.
5. Finally, it moves downward to the end point (19.0, 19.0) within the goal set.

[08/22/2024 03:42:26 PM] The original path attempted to go above obstacle 1, but the chosen waypoints resulted in collisions.  The path needs to be adjusted to completely circumvent obstacle 1 before proceeding towards the goal. One way to do this is to route the path below both obstacles.

Here's how we can adjust the path:

1. **Start Point:** Keep the original starting point (2.0, 1.0). 
2. **Navigate Below Obstacles:** Guide the path downwards to a point with a y-coordinate less than the lowest point of both obstacles.  We can choose (2.0, 11.0) for this.
3. **Clear Obstacles:** Move rightwards to a point horizontally clear of both obstacles. A suitable point could be (12.0, 11.0). 
4. **Approach Goal:**  Move upwards to align with the goal position. A good point for this would be (12.0, 19.0).
5. **Enter Goal Set:** Finally, move leftwards into the goal set at (19.0, 19.0).

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0),  
    (2.0, 11.0), 
    (12.0, 11.0), 
    (12.0, 19.0),
    (19.0, 19.0) 
]
```

This new path avoids both obstacles and successfully reaches the goal set.

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[08/22/2024 03:42:34 PM] The path collides with Obstacle 2 because it tries to go up vertically at x=12.0, while Obstacle 2 occupies roughly x=11 to x=20 for y values between roughly 12.7 and 16.4.

To avoid this, the path needs to move further to the right before heading up. Here's a possible adjusted path:

**Chain of Thought:**

1.  **Original Path Issue:** The path segment from (12.0, 11.0) to (12.0, 19.0) intersects Obstacle 2.
2.  **Obstacle 2 Position:** Obstacle 2 is located to the right of the start set and extends significantly in the x-direction. 
3.  **Solution:** To avoid Obstacle 2, the path needs to move further to the right before proceeding upward.
4.  **New Waypoint:** A new waypoint at (14.0, 11.0) allows the path to clear the obstacle.

**New Path:**
```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0),     # Start Point
    (2.0, 11.0),    # Move Upwards 
    (14.0, 11.0),   # Move Right, clearing Obstacle 2 
    (14.0, 19.0),   # Move Upwards 
    (19.0, 19.0)    # Move Right to Goal
]
```

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[0.1, 16.4], [9.5, 16.3], [9.5, 17.7], [9.3, 19.9]]
			Obstacle 2: [[11.3, 16.4], [11.0, 12.7], [18.4, 12.3], [19.8, 14.1]]

    
## Your generated path:
    path = [(2.0, 1.0), (2.0, 11.0), (14.0, 11.0), (14.0, 19.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    Obstacle Avoidance (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
		Segment 3 between points (14.0, 11.0) and (14.0, 19.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 2: [[11.3, 16.4], [11.0, 12.7], [18.4, 12.3], [19.8, 14.1]]
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:42:38 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 2. Since the problematic segment is vertical, we can move the path horizontally to the right to avoid the obstacle.

We can reroute the path by going around Obstacle 2 to the right.

Here's the updated path:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0),  # Start point
    (2.0, 11.0), # Same as before
    (20.0, 11.0), # Move right to clear Obstacle 2
    (20.0, 19.0), # Move up 
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move slightly left to the end point
]
```
