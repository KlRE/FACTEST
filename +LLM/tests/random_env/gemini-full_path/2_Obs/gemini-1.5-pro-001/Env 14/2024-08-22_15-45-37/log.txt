# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[17.7, 15.9], [7.6, 14.8], [8.5, 8.3], [14.5, 8.4]]
			Obstacle 2: [[19.0, 17.9], [15.7, 17.1], [15.9, 16.9], [19.8, 16.2]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:45:43 PM] The provided environment has a large free space between the start and goal areas. The two obstacles are positioned close to the goal area and are on the opposite side of the map to the starting position. This allows for a relatively simple path to be planned.

First, the path can move directly from the start area towards the goal area until it reaches the y-coordinate just above Obstacle 1.
Then, the path will move rightwards to a point where it can safely clear both obstacles. 
Finally, the path can move downwards and reach the goal position. 

Based on this analysis, a possible path is: 

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Starting point within the start quadrilateral
    (1.0, 16.0),  # Move upwards, staying clear of obstacles
    (17.5, 16.0),  # Move rightwards, positioning to clear obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move downwards to a point within the goal quadrilateral
]
```

[08/22/2024 03:46:00 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 2. I will introduce an additional waypoint to navigate around this obstacle. 

Instead of going directly from (1.0, 16.0) to (17.5, 16.0), the path can first move to a point with a higher y-coordinate, clearing Obstacle 2, and then proceed towards the goal.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     // Start Point
    (1.0, 16.0),    // Move up 
    (15.0, 22.0),  // Move right and up, clearing Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)   // Move down to the goal
]
```

This new path avoids all obstacles while staying within the defined start and goal areas.
