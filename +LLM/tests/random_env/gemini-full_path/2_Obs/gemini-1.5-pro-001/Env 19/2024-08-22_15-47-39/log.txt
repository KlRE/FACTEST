# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[11.2, 6.1], [16.4, 6.3], [20.0, 14.0], [16.4, 11.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[8.0, 13.5], [11.3, 8.9], [16.0, 19.7], [8.8, 14.8]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:47:44 PM] The provided obstacles create a channel that the path can follow to reach the goal. 

* Starting within the start set, the path can initially move upwards, avoiding the left side of Obstacle 1. 
* Then, the path can progress rightwards, staying within the channel formed by the top of Obstacle 1 and the bottom of Obstacle 2. 
* Continuing rightwards, the path can then safely move upwards towards the goal set without intersecting any obstacles.

Here's a possible path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start Point
    (1.0, 5.0),    # Move Up 
    (17.0, 5.0),   # Move Right
    (17.0, 19.0),  # Move Up
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Goal Point
]
```

[08/22/2024 03:47:48 PM] The path intersects with Obstacle 1 because it attempts to go through the obstacle. To fix this, the path needs to be adjusted to go around Obstacle 1. We can achieve this by first moving to the left of Obstacle 1 and then moving upwards.

[08/22/2024 03:48:07 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid crossing Obstacle 1. Since the problematic segment is vertical and located at x=17.0, we can reroute the path by going around Obstacle 1. 

Here's how we can adjust the path:

1.  **Keep the first three waypoints:** These waypoints are fine as they successfully navigate from the start set to a point clear of the initial obstacles. 
    `(1.0, 1.0), (1.0, 5.0), (5.0, 5.0)`
2.  **Navigate around Obstacle 1:** To avoid the collision, we'll route the path to the right of Obstacle 1.  We can achieve this by adding a waypoint to the right of Obstacle 1, ensuring to maintain a safe distance: 
    `(21.0, 5.0)`
3. **Continue to the goal:** From this new waypoint, we can proceed vertically upwards, and then move horizontally towards the goal set:
    `(21.0, 19.0), (19.0, 19.0)`

 Therefore, the corrected path is:

```
new_path = [(1.0, 1.0), (1.0, 5.0), (5.0, 5.0), (21.0, 5.0), (21.0, 19.0), (19.0, 19.0)]
```
