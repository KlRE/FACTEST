# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.4, 11.1], [15.5, 8.9], [19.4, 8.8], [19.2, 9.6]]
			Obstacle 2: [[15.0, 13.4], [6.9, 5.2], [11.5, 5.9], [19.1, 11.6]]
			Obstacle 3: [[17.6, 19.8], [15.3, 19.1], [15.4, 11.6], [15.8, 6.7]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:58:40 PM] The path needs to navigate from the bottom left area to the top right area, avoiding the obstacles in the way. 

- Obstacle 1 sits in the upper middle, slightly angled upwards towards the right. 
- Obstacle 2 sprawls from the middle right, reaching downwards and slightly left. 
- Obstacle 3 is perched above the goal, leaning slightly towards the right.

There seems to be a viable path by initially moving above Obstacle 2 before navigating towards the goal.

Here's a possible path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (1.0, 14.0),  # Move upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 2
    (16.0, 14.0), # Move right, passing above Obstacle 2 
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move to a point within the goal set 
]
```

This path aims to:

1. **Start** inside the start set.
2. **Move vertically** to a height clearing Obstacle 2.
3. **Move horizontally** to a point aligned with the goal, staying clear of Obstacle 1.
4. **Move directly to the goal** set. 

**Important:** This proposed path is a visual estimation and may require adjustments to ensure it maintains a safe distance from the obstacles. It's crucial to verify the clearances with precise calculations based on the provided coordinates.

]

[08/22/2024 03:58:48 PM] The previous path collided with Obstacle 3 because it went straight to the right.  We need to route the path around Obstacle 3.  Here's how:

1.  **Start:** We can keep the starting point (1.0, 1.0) as it's inside the start set.

2.  **Go Up:**  Obstacle 3 extends down to y = 6.7, so let's go above it. A new waypoint at (1.0, 14.0) will do.

3.  **Navigate Right:**  We need to go right, avoiding all obstacles. Notice there's clear space between Obstacles 2 and 3. Let's aim for a point to the right of Obstacle 3 and slightly above Obstacle 2: (18.0, 14.0)

4.  **Reach the Goal:**  From (18.0, 14.0), we have a clear path to move directly into the goal set. We can choose the center of the goal set: (19.0, 19.0).

**New Path:**
```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (1.0, 14.0), 
    (18.0, 14.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)

[08/22/2024 03:58:53 PM] The original path collides with Obstacle 3 because it attempts to cross the obstacle horizontally at a y-value of 14.0. To avoid this, we can route the path above Obstacle 3, which extends up to a y-value of roughly 19.8. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (1.0, 20.0),   # Move vertically upwards to a point clear of all obstacles 
    (18.0, 20.0),  # Move horizontally towards the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move into the goal set
]
```

This path first moves vertically upward, clearing all obstacles, then proceeds horizontally towards the goal, and finally enters the goal set. This strategy avoids any intersections with obstacles.
