# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data

[08/22/2024 03:59:11 PM] The primary issue with the initial path is the direct line segments crossing through obstacles. To rectify this, the path needs to navigate around the obstacles. 

1. **Start:** The start point (1.0, 1.0) is fine. 

2. **Navigating Obstacles:** Instead of going directly to (16.0, 10.0), we need to steer clear of Obstacle 2 and the lower part of Obstacle 3.  A good strategy is to:
    *  Move up to a point like (10.0, 12.0) which is above Obstacle 2 and clear of Obstacle 3. 

3. **Approaching the Goal:** From (10.0, 12.0), we can head towards the goal while avoiding the top portion of Obstacle 1:
    * Continue to a point like (16.0, 16.0) which keeps a safe distance from Obstacle 1.

4. **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, from (16.0, 16.0) it's a clear path to the goal set. We can choose the center of the goal set: (19.0, 19.0)

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (10.0, 12.0), 
    (16.0, 16.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)

[08/22/2024 03:59:20 PM] The original path intersects with obstacle 3 because it attempts to move directly from the start to the goal set. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around the obstacles. 

First, it's necessary to identify a safe passage. Observing the obstacles, there's a clear path above obstacle 2 and below obstacle 3. 

The initial waypoint (1.0, 1.0) is already good as it lies within the start set.

The second waypoint needs to be adjusted to steer clear of obstacle 3. It should be above obstacle 2 which has a maximum y-coordinate of around 11.1. Therefore, a safe y-coordinate for the second waypoint could be 12.  Let's place the second waypoint at (5.0, 12.0) to ensure a safe passage around obstacle 3.

Next, the path needs to navigate towards the goal set while staying clear of obstacle 1. A safe passage exists to the right of obstacle 1 which has a maximum x-coordinate of around 18.1. Therefore, a safe x-coordinate for the third waypoint could be 19.0, and to avoid obstacle 1, we need to go higher than its maximum y-coordinate of 19.0. We can set the third waypoint at (19.0, 21.0).

Finally, the path can proceed directly to the goal set. Placing the final waypoint at (19.0, 19.0) will ensure it lies within the goal set. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (5.0, 12.0), 
    (19.0, 21.0),

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:59:26 PM] The initial path goes directly towards the goal but collides with Obstacle 3. To circumvent this, the path needs adjustments. 

1. **Navigate around Obstacle 3:** Obstacle 3 presents a challenge as it stretches across a significant portion of the y-axis. We can navigate around it by first moving rightwards, avoiding its x-coordinate span. 

2. **Clear Path Towards Goal:** After successfully maneuvering around Obstacle 3, a clear path towards the goal opens up. We can then proceed to the goal without encountering any further obstacles.

Here's a possible revised path based on these considerations:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Starting point within the start set
    (6.0, 1.0),   # Move rightwards, steering clear of Obstacle 3's x-coordinate range
    (6.0, 20.0),  # Move upwards, safely past Obstacle 3
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move towards the goal, ending within the goal set 
]
```
