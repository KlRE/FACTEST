# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[17.1, 19.3], [15.0, 17.5], [16.1, 16.6], [18.4, 15.4]]
			Obstacle 2: [[15.1, 17.0], [8.1, 16.5], [17.3, 10.5], [18.7, 10.3]]

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:55:31 PM] The original path intersects with obstacles 1 and 2. To avoid this, we need to adjust the path to go around these obstacles.

1. **Segment 2 Analysis**: The second segment connects (1.0, 15.0) to (17.0, 15.0), cutting through Obstacle 2. We can navigate around this obstacle by moving south before reaching Obstacle 2 and then moving back up north to the target y-coordinate.

2. **Segment 3 Analysis**:  The third segment connects (17.0, 15.0) to (19.0, 19.0), intersecting with Obstacles 1 and 3. A safe passage can be created by staying on the left side of these obstacles. We can achieve this by moving further east before heading north.

Based on these observations, here is a revised path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start Point
    (1.0, 13.0),   # Move South to avoid Obstacle 2
    (17.0, 13.0),  # Move East, staying below Obstacle 2
    (17.0, 19.0),  # Move North, clear of obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Reach the Goal Point 
]

[08/22/2024 03:55:39 PM] The initial path attempts to navigate directly to the goal region, resulting in collisions with Obstacles 1 and 2.  A revised strategy must account for these obstacles.

1. **Vertical Movement:** Starting at (1.0, 1.0), the path should first move vertically upwards. This avoids any immediate intersection with Obstacle 2. A suitable waypoint for this upward movement could be (1.0, 8.0), safely clear of Obstacle 2's highest point. 

2. **Horizontal Movement:** From (1.0, 8.0), the path can proceed horizontally towards the goal region. This movement needs to occur below Obstacle 1 and above Obstacle 2.  A safe passage exists between the y-coordinates of these obstacles. (10.0, 8.0) would be a safe waypoint along this horizontal path. 

3. **Final Approach:**  With Obstacle 1 cleared, the path can move vertically upwards towards the goal region. (10.0, 19.0) positions the path for a final horizontal movement into the goal set.

4. **Goal Entry:** The final waypoint can be placed directly within the goal set. (19.0, 19.0) satisfies this requirement.

**New Path:**

Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/22/2024 03:56:07 PM] The initial path goes through obstacles 2, 1 and 3. To avoid this, we can adjust the path to go above all the obstacles. 

1. **Start:** Keep the starting point (1.0, 1.0).
2. **Above Obstacle 2:**  Obstacle 2's highest y-coordinate is 17.0.  Route the path to a point above this obstacle, for instance (1.0, 17.5).
3. **Above Obstacles 1 & 3:** The highest y-coordinate among obstacles 1 and 3 is 19.4. To stay clear, guide the path to a point with a y-coordinate greater than 19.4, such as (1.0, 20.0).
4. **Towards Goal:** Now safely past all obstacles, move the path towards the goal, for instance, to the point (19.0, 20.0).
5. **End:** Finally, connect to a point within the goal set, such as (19.0, 19.0).

Therefore, a modified path that avoids all obstacles is:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (1.0, 17.5), 
    (1.0, 20.0), 
    (19.0, 20.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```
