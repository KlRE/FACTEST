# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[2.5, 12.5], [12.6, 13.6], [12.4, 17.1], [2.7, 15.1]]

[08/22/2024 03:52:08 PM] The initial path goes directly through the obstacle space. It needs to be adjusted to navigate around Obstacles 1 and 2 to reach the goal. We can achieve this by routing the path above Obstacle 1 and then towards the goal. 

Here's a possible approach:

1. **From the start point:** Move upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 1. A safe waypoint could be around (1.0, 13.0), which is above the highest point of Obstacle 1.
2. **Moving rightwards:** Navigate towards the goal while staying above Obstacle 1. A good intermediary point could be (13.0, 13.0), which is to the right of Obstacle 1 and clear of Obstacle 2. 
3. **Approaching the goal:** Continue moving towards the goal, staying clear of Obstacle 3. We can safely move directly to the goal from our current position.

Based on this approach, here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Starting point
    (1.0, 13.0), # Move upwards, clear of Obstacle 1 
    (13.0, 13.0), # Move rightwards, clear of Obstacles 1 and 2
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Move to the goal
]

[08/22/2024 03:52:17 PM] The initial path crosses obstacles because it attempts to move horizontally across the workspace without considering the obstacles' positions.  We need a path that maneuvers around obstacles, potentially changing directions multiple times.

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Starting Point:** (1.0, 1.0) - This point is within the start set. 

2. **Move Upwards:**  We need to navigate around Obstacle 1. Since it's positioned to the right and upward, let's move straight upwards to a y-coordinate greater than Obstacle 1's highest point. Let's choose (1.0, 17.5). 

3. **Move Rightwards:** With Obstacle 1 below us, we can now move horizontally towards the goal. However, we need to watch out for Obstacle 2. A safe x-coordinate would be somewhere past Obstacle 2,  let's say (14.0, 17.5).

4. **Approach the Goal:** Now we have a clear path downwards towards the goal set. We can move straight down to a point like (14.0, 19.0).

5. **Enter Goal Set:** Finally, move horizontally to enter the goal set. A suitable endpoint would be (19.0, 19.0). 

**New Path:**
```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (1.0, 17.5), 
    (14.0, 17.5), 
    (14.0, 19.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
] 
``` 
This path avoids all obstacles by strategically moving around them.

    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:52:27 PM] The initial path has several intersections with obstacles. We need to adjust it to navigate around them successfully. 

1. **Segment 1 Issue:** The first segment goes from (1.0, 1.0) to (1.0, 17.5), directly through Obstacle 2. 
2. **Segment 2 & 3 Issue:** The second segment, going from (1.0, 17.5) to (14.0, 17.5), and the third segment, going from (14.0, 17.5) to (14.0, 19.0), both clash with Obstacle 3. 

**Path Adjustment Strategy:**

* We need to chart a course that avoids these obstacles entirely.  Let's analyze the obstacles and identify safe passageways:
    * **Vertical Clearance:** There's a clear vertical path between Obstacles 1 and 2. 
    * **Horizontal Maneuvering:** After clearing Obstacle 2, we can move horizontally towards the goal, navigating below Obstacle 3.

**New Path:**

Based on this strategy, here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start Point (unchanged)
    (1.0, 14.5),   # Move vertically upward, staying clear below Obstacle 2
    (8.0, 14.5),   # Move horizontally to the right, staying below Obstacle 2
    (8.0, 17.0),   # Move vertically upward,  positioning to navigate below Obstacle 3
    (17.0, 17.0),  # Move horizontally towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End Point (unchanged)
]
```

**Explanation:**

* The new path first focuses on clearing Obstacle 2 by moving vertically upwards.
* Once clear of Obstacle 2, it moves horizontally to the right, preparing to go around Obstacle 3.
* It then maneuvers below Obstacle 3 by making strategic vertical and horizontal movements.
* Finally, it proceeds horizontally towards the goal.

This adjusted path avoids all obstacles and successfully reaches the goal set.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data

[08/22/2024 03:52:34 PM] The original path attempts to navigate directly to the goal set but encounters multiple obstacles. A more strategic approach is needed.

1. **Initial Path Analysis**: The provided path collides with obstacles in almost all segments.  We need to find a way around the obstacles.

2. **Identifying a Viable Corridor**:  Observing the obstacle placements, there seems to be a relatively clear path above all obstacles. We can aim to navigate the path along this corridor.

3. **Adjusting Waypoints**:
    * From the start point, we can move vertically upwards until we clear all obstacles. 
    * Then, we can move horizontally towards the goal set.
    * Finally, we adjust the path slightly to enter the goal set.

## New Path:
    new_path = [
        (1.0, 1.0),  // Start Point
        (1.0, 18.0), // Move up, clearing all obstacles

[08/22/2024 03:52:43 PM] The original path attempted to move straight up and then straight right. This fails as it intersects with obstacles 2 and 3.  The path needs to navigate around these obstacles.

1. **Starting Point:** Keep starting point at (1.0, 1.0).

2. **Navigating Obstacle 2:**  Obstacle 2 extends further right (x-coordinate) than it does upward (y-coordinate). 
    * Move right, giving Obstacle 2 a wide berth: (10.0, 1.0) 
    * This avoids crossing any part of Obstacle 2.

3. **Navigating Obstacle 3:** Now above all obstacles, a direct path to the goal is possible.
    * Move upwards towards the goal: (10.0, 19.0) 

4. **Reaching the Goal:** A straight shot is now clear.
    * Move right to enter the goal set: (19.0, 19.0)
