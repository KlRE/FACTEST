# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.6, 8.3], [3.7, 5.9], [7.8, 14.1], [3.6, 10.3]]
			Obstacle 2: [[5.9, 19.5], [3.1, 17.5], [5.1, 15.7], [10.4, 16.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[8.8, 15.0], [15.9, 17.7], [17.5, 19.1], [14.4, 18.4]]

[08/22/2024 03:56:50 PM] The original path intersects with Obstacle 1 because it attempts to move directly to the right after clearing the top of the obstacle. To avoid this, the path can be adjusted to move upwards before moving right, clearing the obstacle entirely. 

Here's how to adjust the path:

1. **Start Point:** The start point (1.0, 1.0) is fine.
2. **Move Upwards:** From the start point, move to a point above the highest point of Obstacle 1. Looking at the coordinates, a y-value of 15 would suffice. Let's choose the waypoint (1.0, 15.0). 
3. **Move Rightwards:** Now that the path is clear of Obstacle 1, move rightwards to a point beyond its furthest right x-coordinate. A value of 8 would work. Let's choose the waypoint (8.0, 15.0).
4. **Navigate Obstacles 2 and 3:**  Obstacles 2 and 3 are relatively close together. To avoid them, the path can move downwards to a y-value of 10,  then rightwards to a point where it can safely move upwards again. Let's add waypoints (8.0, 10.0) and (17.0, 10.0).
5. **Move to the Goal:**  Finally, move upwards to the goal area. The waypoint (17.0, 19.0) sits nicely within the goal set.

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (1.0, 15.0), 
    (8.0, 15.0),
    (8.0, 10.0),
    (17.0, 10.0),
    (17.0, 19.0)
]

[08/22/2024 03:57:09 PM] The path needs adjustments to avoid Obstacle 3 and reach the goal set. Here's how I'd correct it:

1. **Addressing Obstacle 3:** The segment from (17.0, 10.0) to (17.0, 19.0) cuts through Obstacle 3. To avoid this, we can route the path around the obstacle. Since the obstacle extends to roughly x=17.5, we need to move further right. 

2. **Reaching the Goal Set:**  The final waypoint needs to sit within the goal set.

Considering these points, here's a possible revised path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start (unchanged)
    (1.0, 15.0),  # Upwards movement (unchanged) 
    (8.0, 15.0),  # Rightward movement (unchanged)
    (8.0, 10.0),  # Downwards movement (unchanged)
    (18.5, 10.0), # Rightward movement, clear of Obstacle 3
    (18.5, 19.0), # Upwards movement, clear of Obstacle 3
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Adjusted to land within the goal set 
]
```

This path maintains the initial segments for efficiency and then makes adjustments to navigate around Obstacle 3 before reaching a valid point within the goal set.
