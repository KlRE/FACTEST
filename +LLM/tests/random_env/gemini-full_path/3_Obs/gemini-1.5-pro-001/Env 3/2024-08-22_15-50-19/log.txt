# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.6, 10.8], [14.3, 14.0], [7.3, 14.8], [3.6, 12.7]]
			Obstacle 2: [[19.0, 8.6], [15.5, 5.1], [16.1, 0.6], [17.6, 4.4]]

[08/22/2024 03:50:36 PM] The initial path goes through obstacles 1 and 3. To navigate around these obstacles, we can adjust the path as follows:

1. **From the start point (1.0, 1.0):** We can keep the initial segment that goes north to (1.0, 11.0), as this avoids Obstacle 2. 
2. **Navigating Obstacle 1 and 3:** Instead of moving directly east, we need to navigate around the corner of Obstacle 1. We can add a waypoint to the east of Obstacle 1, such as (15.0, 11.0). This allows us to move around the obstacle while staying clear.
3. **Approaching the Goal:** From (15.0, 11.0), we can move south, avoiding Obstacle 3, to a point like (15.0, 17.0). 
4. **Reaching the Goal:**  Finally, we can move east to reach the goal set, for example at (19.0, 17.0).

Therefore, a possible corrected path is:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (1.0, 11.0), 
    (15.0, 11.0),

[08/22/2024 03:51:12 PM] The initial path fails to navigate around the obstacles and reach the goal. Here's a breakdown of the adjustments needed and a possible new path:

**Analysis:**

1. **Obstacle 1:**  This obstacle sits in the path between the start and goal.  
2. **Obstacle 2:** This obstacle is positioned to the right side and slightly below the goal. It shouldn't pose a direct problem unless the chosen path goes that way.
3. **Obstacle 3:** This obstacle lies to the right of the start and extends vertically, partially blocking the path toward the goal. 

**Strategy:**

The key is to find a way to navigate above Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3 to reach the goal. 

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     // Start within the start set
    (1.0, 15.0),    // Move vertically upwards, clearing Obstacle 1 and 3
    (19.5, 15.0),   // Move horizontally towards the goal 
    (19.5, 19.0)    // Move vertically down into the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

* **(1.0, 1.0) -> (1.0, 15.0):** This segment moves the path vertically upwards, safely clearing both Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3.
* **(1.0, 15.0) -> (19.5, 15.0):** This segment moves the path horizontally towards the goal, staying well above the obstacles.
* **(19.5, 15.0) -> (19.5, 19.0):** This final segment moves the path vertically downwards, placing it within the goal set.

This new path successfully avoids all obstacles and reaches the goal by maneuvering in the open space above the obstacles.

        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:51:19 PM] The initial path went too far right while moving upwards, leading to a collision with Obstacle 3. To fix this, the path should stay clear to the left of Obstacle 3. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (1.0, 15.0),   # Move upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 1
    (5.0, 15.0),   # Move rightwards, staying clear of Obstacle 3
    (19.5, 15.0),  # Move rightwards towards the goal 
    (19.5, 19.0)   # Move downwards to end within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(1.0, 1.0) to (1.0, 15.0):**  This segment moves straight up, staying well clear of Obstacle 1. 
2. **(1.0, 15.0) to (5.0, 15.0):** This segment moves rightwards, staying to the left of Obstacle 3 to avoid a collision. 
3. **(5.0, 15.0) to (19.5, 15.0):** Now clear of all obstacles, this segment moves directly towards the goal.
4. **(19.5, 15.0) to (19.5, 19.0):**  This final segment moves straight down into the goal set.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.6, 10.8], [14.3, 14.0], [7.3, 14.8], [3.6, 12.7]]
			Obstacle 2: [[19.0, 8.6], [15.5, 5.1], [16.1, 0.6], [17.6, 4.4]]
			Obstacle 3: [[6.2, 13.5], [16.3, 10.7], [19.1, 16.7], [6.8, 14.2]]

    
## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.0, 1.0), (1.0, 15.0), (5.0, 15.0), (19.5, 15.0), (19.5, 19.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    Obstacle Avoidance (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
		Segment 3 between points (5.0, 15.0) and (19.5, 15.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 3: [[6.2, 13.5], [16.3, 10.7], [19.1, 16.7], [6.8, 14.2]]
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

[08/22/2024 03:51:26 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 3. To do this, we can add a waypoint that routes the path above Obstacle 3. 

Here's how we can adjust the path:

1. **Original Problematic Segment:** The segment connecting (5.0, 15.0) and (19.5, 15.0) directly crosses Obstacle 3. 
2. **Identifying a Safe Passage:**  We need to navigate around Obstacle 3. Since the obstacle extends further down than the previous waypoint (5.0, 15.0), we need to route the path above the obstacle.
3. **Adding a Waypoint Above Obstacle 3:** We can add a waypoint at (5.0, 17.0) This waypoint is above Obstacle 3 and provides a clear path to the goal.
4. **Connecting to the Goal:**  The final segment can now connect (5.0, 17.0) to (19.5, 19.0) without intersecting any obstacles.

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [(1.0, 1.0), (1.0, 15.0), (5.0, 15.0), (5.0, 17.0), (19.5, 19.0)] 
```
