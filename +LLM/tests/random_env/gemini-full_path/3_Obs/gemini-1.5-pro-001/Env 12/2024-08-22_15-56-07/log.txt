# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.1, 13.0], [17.5, 10.6], [17.5, 19.3], [15.5, 17.6]]
			Obstacle 2: [[18.2, 12.2], [7.8, 10.0], [9.3, 4.6], [15.3, 1.7]]
			Obstacle 3: [[4.9, 10.3], [11.8, 9.6], [13.7, 19.3], [7.6, 19.1]]

    
## Instructions

    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.

[08/22/2024 03:56:23 PM] The initial path was trying to take a more or less straight line to the goal, but it intersects with obstacles 2 and 3. To circumvent this, we need to navigate around these obstacles.

Looking at the positions of obstacles 2 and 3, we can see that there is a relatively clear path above obstacle 3.  We can adjust the path to first move upwards, staying clear of obstacle 3, then proceed rightwards towards the goal, and finally move down into the goal set.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (2.0, 12.0),  # Move upwards, staying clear of obstacle 3 
    (16.0, 12.0), # Move rightwards, staying clear of obstacles 2 & 3
    (16.0, 20.0), # Move downwards towards the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set
]

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:56:31 PM] The original path intersects with Obstacle 3 because it attempts to move horizontally across the environment without considering the obstacle's position.  It then intersects with Obstacle 1 because it tries to move vertically without accounting for Obstacle 1's location.

To correct this, the path needs to navigate around the obstacles strategically:

1. **Starting Point:**  We'll keep the starting point at (2.0, 1.0).

2. **Navigating Obstacle 3:** Instead of moving horizontally first, we'll move vertically upwards to a y-coordinate greater than the highest point of Obstacle 3 (19.3). Let's choose (2.0, 20.0).

3. **Moving Towards the Goal:** Now we can safely move horizontally towards the goal, bypassing Obstacle 3. We'll set a waypoint to the right of Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 1, for example (17.0, 20.0). 

4. **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, we can move down vertically to reach the goal set. A suitable endpoint within the goal set is (19.0, 19.0).

Therefore, the corrected path is:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0), 
    (2.0, 20.0),
    (17.0, 20.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This path successfully avoids both obstacles by first moving vertically to clear Obstacle 3, then moving horizontally to a point where it can safely descend into the goal set.
