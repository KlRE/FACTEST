# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[0.7, 18.1], [2.7, 15.1], [11.8, 13.8], [8.3, 18.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[19.9, 14.3], [14.8, 9.5], [14.9, 7.7], [19.0, 2.3]]
			Obstacle 3: [[17.9, 6.2], [20.0, 5.8], [19.4, 14.6], [19.2, 13.5]]

    
## Instructions

]

[08/22/2024 03:53:22 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid Obstacle 1.  Looking at the positions of the waypoints and the obstacle, it seems the path is attempting to move diagonally upwards and to the right towards the goal.  The issue is that Obstacle 1 is located in the path of this diagonal movement. 

To circumvent this, we can adjust the path to first move right, then up, then continue towards the goal. This avoids the diagonal movement that intersects Obstacle 1.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (5.0, 1.0), 
    (5.0, 10.0),  # Move upwards to clear Obstacle 1
    (12.0, 16.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)
]

[08/22/2024 03:53:27 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 1. By analyzing the environment, we can see that we can route the path below Obstacle 1.

Here's the updated path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (5.0, 1.0),  
    (5.0, 6.0),  # Move upwards, clearing Obstacle 1
    (12.0, 16.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)  
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Waypoint Added:** A new waypoint (5.0, 6.0) is introduced. 
2. **Path Rerouting:** Instead of going directly towards the goal, the path now first moves upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 1, before proceeding towards the goal. 

This revised path ensures a safe passage by navigating around the obstacle while still adhering to the start and end point requirements.
