# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[14.1, 17.2], [10.7, 6.0], [18.4, 10.0], [19.4, 12.6]]
			Obstacle 2: [[5.9, 8.9], [9.9, 1.2], [14.8, 11.3], [13.5, 12.1]]
			Obstacle 3: [[5.6, 9.0], [14.0, 9.4], [15.7, 16.4], [6.5, 12.7]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:53:35 PM] The provided obstacles create a channel that widens as it progresses from the start set to the goal set.  The path can stay within this channel to avoid all obstacles.

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start set
    (4.0, 7.0),  # Navigate around Obstacle 2 while staying within the channel 
    (10.0, 12.0), # Continue through the channel, adjusting for the widening
    (16.0, 16.0), # Approach the goal set while staying clear of obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set

[08/22/2024 03:54:09 PM] The initial path has intersections with the obstacles due to the following:
- Segment from (4.0, 6.0) to (10.0, 6.0) cuts through Obstacle 2.
- Segment from (10.0, 6.0) to (16.0, 16.0) goes through Obstacles 1, 2, and 3. 

To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around the obstacles. 

Observing the layout:
- There is a clear space below all obstacles. 
- We can route the path by first moving right, then upwards, and finally towards the goal.

Here is a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (10.0, 1.0),   # Move right, staying below obstacles
    (10.0, 17.0),  # Move upwards, clear of Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move to the goal within the goal set
]
```

This new path avoids all obstacles:
- The first segment moves right, staying clear below all obstacles.
- The second segment moves upwards, safely navigating past Obstacle 1.
- The final segment reaches the goal without intersecting any obstacles.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:54:17 PM] The initial path goes directly up from (10.0, 1.0) to (10.0, 17.0), cutting through obstacles 2 and 3. To avoid this, we need to navigate around these obstacles. 

We can do this by first moving to the right, then going up, and then finally moving right towards the goal. Here's a possible adjusted path:

1. **(1.0, 1.0):** Start within the start set.
2. **(16.0, 1.0):** Move right, staying clear of obstacle 2. 
3. **(16.0, 19.0):** Move upwards, now clear of both obstacles 2 and 3.
4. **(19.0, 19.0):** Move right to reach the goal set.

**New Path:**

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data

    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:54:24 PM] The initial path went straight upwards from a starting point of (16.0, 1.0) to (16.0, 19.0). This intersected with Obstacle 1 which spanned roughly x-coordinates 10 to 19 with a  y-coordinate range of 6 to 17.

To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle. One way is to move to the right side of Obstacle 1 since the goal is to the top-right of the obstacle field.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (2.0, 1.0),   # Move slightly to the right 
    (2.0, 13.0),   # Move upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 2
    (20.0, 13.0),  # Move right, clear of all obstacles
    (20.0, 19.0)   # Move up to the goal set
]
```

This path first moves slightly to the right to avoid potential conflicts with the corner of Obstacle 2. Then it moves upwards to a y-coordinate greater than the top of Obstacle 2. From there, it's safe to move directly right, clearing all obstacles. Finally, it moves up to reach the goal set.

[08/22/2024 03:54:29 PM] The initial path attempted to go horizontally across the environment at y = 13. However, both obstacle 1 and obstacle 3 cross this horizontal line, making this strategy unviable. 

Instead, we can observe that there is ample space below the obstacles to move to the right.  The path can move horizontally to the right, avoiding obstacle 2, then move up between obstacles 1 and 3, and finally continue right towards the goal. 

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
