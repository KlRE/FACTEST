# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.

]

[08/22/2024 03:57:20 PM] The initial path attempts to move right and then up, but it runs into obstacles. A better strategy would be to navigate around the obstacles by first moving upwards, then right, and finally upwards again towards the goal. 

Here's a breakdown of the adjusted path:

1. **Start at (1.0, 2.0)**: This point is inside the start set.
2. **Move up to (1.0, 10.0)**: This takes us clear of Obstacle 3. 
3. **Move right to (16.0, 10.0)**: This avoids both Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3.
4. **Move up to (16.0, 19.0)**: This positions us directly below the goal set.
5. **Move right to (19.0, 19.0)**: This final movement brings us into the goal set.

Therefore, the adjusted path is as follows:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0), 
    (1.0, 10.0), 
    (16.0, 10.0), 
    (16.0, 19.0),

]

[08/22/2024 03:57:31 PM] The original path attempts to cross directly through the obstacles, which is not allowed.  We need to find a way around them. 

Let's break down the path adjustments:

1. **Initial Segment:** The first segment from (1.0, 2.0) to (1.0, 10.0) already avoids Obstacle 3, so we can keep that.

2. **Navigating Obstacle 2:** The second segment needs to reach (16.0, 10.0) but Obstacle 2 blocks a direct path. 
    * **Going Around:**  We can guide the path around the top-right corner of Obstacle 2.  
    * **New Waypoints:** To achieve this, we can add waypoints like (1.0, 16.0) to clear Obstacle 2, and then (10.0, 16.0) to move towards the right side, and finally (10.0, 10.0) to go down towards our target point (16.0, 10.0).

3. **Avoiding Obstacle 1:** The original third segment directly hits Obstacle 1.
   * **Staying High:** Since we already went above Obstacle 2, we can continue at a higher y-coordinate to avoid Obstacle 1 entirely. 
   * **Waypoint Adjustment:** We can change the existing waypoint (16.0, 10.0) to (16.0, 19.0).

4. **Final Approach:** The last segment to (19.0, 19.0) remains valid, as it starts from a point above Obstacle 1 and stays clear.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0), 
    (1.0, 10.0), 
    (1.0, 16.0), # Added to go around Obstacle 2
    (10.0, 16.0), # Added to go around Obstacle 2
    (10.0, 10.0), # Added to go around Obstacle 2
    (16.0, 10.0),
    (16.0, 19.0),  
    (19.0, 19.0) 
]
```

This new path carefully navigates the obstacles to reach the goal.

Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:57:39 PM] The path needs adjustments to avoid obstacles 1 and 2. 

- **Segment 5:**  Instead of going straight from (10.0, 10.0) to (16.0, 10.0), we need to navigate around obstacle 2. We can achieve this by first going up to a y-coordinate above the obstacle and then moving right. 
- **Segment 6:** The path needs to stay to the right of obstacles 1 and 2.  

Considering these adjustments, here's a possible modified path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0),     # Start
    (1.0, 10.0),    # Move Up 
    (1.0, 16.0),    # Continue Up
    (10.0, 16.0),   # Move Right
    (10.0, 13.0),   # Move Down to clear obstacle 2
    (14.0, 13.0),   # Move Right, staying clear of obstacle 2
    (14.0, 19.0),   # Move Up, staying clear of obstacle 2
    (16.0, 19.0),   # Move Right
    (19.0, 19.0)    # Reach Goal

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[14.3, 20.0], [13.8, 19.0], [16.5, 15.4], [19.7, 15.3]]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.

			Obstacle 1: [[14.3, 20.0], [13.8, 19.0], [16.5, 15.4], [19.7, 15.3]]
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 03:57:48 PM] The original path collides with obstacles primarily due to the segment moving directly upwards at x=14. This segment intersects both Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2. To rectify this, the path should navigate around these obstacles.

1. **Initial Maneuver:** The first part of the path, moving from the start set to (1.0, 16.0), is safe.

2. **Circumventing Obstacles:** Instead of moving straight up to (14.0, 16.0), the path needs to navigate around Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2. We can achieve this by:

    *  Moving further right before encountering the obstacles.
    *  Going around Obstacle 1 by keeping a larger x-value, then maneuvering left to approach the goal set.

3. **Final Approach:**  After clearing the obstacles, the path can then proceed safely towards the goal set.

Here's a revised path considering these adjustments:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0), 
    (1.0, 16.0), 
    (10.0, 16.0), 
    (10.0, 13.0),
    (13.0, 13.0), # Adjusted to stay clear of Obstacle 2
    (13.0, 17.0), # Moving up before Obstacle 1
    (17.0, 17.0), # Moving right to clear Obstacle 1
    (17.0, 19.0), # Safely approaching the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This path avoids collisions by steering clear of the obstacle cluster and provides a safe passage to the goal set.

[08/22/2024 03:58:07 PM] The previous path goes too far east before heading north, causing collisions with Obstacle 1. To fix this, the path needs to move north before Obstacle 1 and navigate around it to the east.

new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0),  # Start point
    (1.0, 16.0), # Move north, same as before

    (10.0, 13.0), # Move south, same as before
    (13.0, 13.0), # Move east, same as before
    (13.0, 14.0), # Move north, avoiding the southern point of Obstacle 1
    (16.0, 14.0), # Move east, staying clear of Obstacle 1
    (16.0, 17.0), # Move north, clearing the eastern point of Obstacle 1

    (17.0, 19.0), # Move north, same as before
