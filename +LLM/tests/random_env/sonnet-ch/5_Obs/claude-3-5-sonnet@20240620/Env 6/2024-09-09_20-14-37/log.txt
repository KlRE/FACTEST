# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[10.2, 0.1], [13.8, 4.6], [13.6, 9.2], [12.3, 6.1]]
			Obstacle 2: [[7.5, 17.2], [0.2, 15.8], [3.3, 15.7], [10.6, 16.2]]

			Obstacle 4: [[11.6, 2.1], [16.5, 11.8], [16.1, 13.2], [14.6, 12.8]]
			Obstacle 5: [[0.7, 9.1], [4.0, 4.3], [7.8, 9.2], [7.7, 12.1]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.

[09/09/2024 08:14:43 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and propose a path that avoids the obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set.

Analysis:
1. The start set is in the bottom-left corner, and the goal set is in the top-right corner.
2. There are five obstacles scattered across the space.
3. A direct path from start to goal is not possible due to the obstacles.
4. We need to find a route that navigates around these obstacles safely.

Path strategy:
1. Start from the top-right corner of the start set.
2. Move upwards to avoid Obstacle 5.
3. Navigate between Obstacle 5 and Obstacle 3.
4. Move towards the right, passing above Obstacle 1 and below Obstacle 2.
5. Navigate between Obstacle 4 and Obstacle 2.
6. Finally, approach the goal set from the left.

Based on this analysis, here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Start at the top-right corner of the start set
    (2.0, 13.0),   # Move upwards, avoiding Obstacle 5
    (8.0, 13.0),   # Move right, passing between Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 2
    (14.0, 15.0),  # Continue moving right and slightly up, avoiding Obstacle 4
    (17.0, 15.0),  # Move further right, staying below Obstacle 2
    (18.5, 18.5)   # Move to the center of the goal set
]

This path should satisfy the requirements:
1. It starts within the start set and ends within the goal set.
2. It avoids all obstacles with a safe distance.
3. The linear segments between waypoints do not cross any obstacles.
4. It provides a relatively smooth and efficient route from start to goal.

[09/09/2024 08:14:50 PM] Thank you for the feedback and example. I'll analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and adjust the path accordingly.

Analysis:
1. The start point (2.0, 2.0) is correct within the start set.
2. The first segment intersects with Obstacles 3 and 5. We need to avoid these by moving around them.
3. The second and third segments also intersect with Obstacle 3. We need to find a path that goes around this large obstacle.
4. The end point (18.5, 18.5) is correct within the goal set.

Adjustments:
1. We'll start by moving right to avoid Obstacle 5.
2. Then we'll move up between Obstacles 1 and 5.
3. We'll continue moving right, staying above Obstacle 4 and below Obstacle 2.
4. Finally, we'll move up to reach the goal set.

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Start point
    (6.0, 2.0),    # Move right to avoid Obstacle 5
    (6.0, 10.0),   # Move up between Obstacles 1 and 5
    (15.0, 10.0),  # Move right, staying above Obstacle 4 and below Obstacle 2
    (15.0, 16.0),  # Move up to approach the goal set
    (18.5, 18.5)   # End point in the goal set
]

This path should avoid all obstacles:
1. It starts in the start set.
2. The first segment moves right, avoiding Obstacle 5.
3. The second segment moves up, passing between Obstacles 1 and 5.
4. The third segment moves right, staying above Obstacle 4 and below Obstacles 2 and 3.
5. The fourth and fifth segments approach and enter the goal set without intersecting any obstacles.
6. It ends in the goal set.

This path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles and should not intersect with any of them.

[09/09/2024 08:15:00 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issues are with segments 2, 3, and 4, which intersect with obstacles 4 and 5.
3. We need to find a way around these obstacles while keeping a safe distance.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Start point (2.0, 2.0) is good, so we'll keep it.
2. Instead of going straight to (6.0, 2.0), we'll move diagonally to avoid obstacle 5.
3. We'll go around the left side of obstacle 5, keeping a safe distance.
4. Then we'll move upwards between obstacles 3 and 4.
5. We'll go around the right side of obstacle 2.
6. Finally, we'll approach the goal set from the right side.

Based on this analysis, here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Start point
    (3.5, 3.5),    # Move diagonally to avoid obstacle 5
    (3.5, 8.5),    # Move up, staying left of obstacle 5
    (9.5, 8.5),    # Move right, between obstacles 3 and 4
    (14.0, 8.5),   # Continue right, staying below obstacle 4
    (17.0, 14.0),  # Move up and right, avoiding obstacle 4
    (17.0, 17.0),  # Move up, staying right of obstacle 2
    (18.5, 18.5)   # End point in the goal set
]

This path should avoid all obstacles while maintaining a safe distance. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set. The waypoints are chosen to create linear segments that don't intersect with any obstacles. 

The path now takes a more circuitous route, but it ensures obstacle avoidance:

[09/09/2024 08:15:09 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and adjust the path accordingly.

Analysis and thought process:

1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.

2. The main issues are with segments intersecting obstacles, particularly obstacles 1, 4, and 5.

3. To avoid Obstacle 5, we need to go around it either to the left or above it.

4. There's a narrow passage between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 4 that we can potentially use.

5. We need to avoid the upper part of Obstacle 4 when moving towards the goal.

6. There's open space in the upper right corner that we can use to approach the goal.

Based on this analysis, I'll adjust the path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),  # Start point (unchanged)
    (2.0, 3.5),  # Move up to avoid Obstacle 5
    (0.5, 3.5),  # Move left to go around Obstacle 5
    (0.5, 10.5), # Move up, staying clear of Obstacle 5 and Obstacle 3
    (9.5, 10.5), # Move right, above Obstacle 1 and below Obstacle 2
    (14.5, 10.5), # Continue right, through the gap between Obstacle 1 and 4
    (14.5, 15.0), # Move up to clear Obstacle 4
    (17.5, 15.0), # Move right, above all obstacles
    (17.5, 18.5), # Move up towards the goal
    (18.5, 18.5)  # End point (unchanged)
]

Explanation of changes:

1. We now go around Obstacle 5 to the left and above, maintaining a safe distance.
2. The path then moves upward, staying clear of Obstacle 3.
3. We utilize the space above Obstacle 1 and below Obstacle 2 to move right.
4. The path then passes through the gap between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 4.
5. We move upward to clear Obstacle 4 before heading towards the goal.
6. The final approach to the goal is from above, avoiding all obstacles.

This new path should avoid all obstacles while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. The additional waypoints provide more precise control over the path's trajectory, ensuring it maintains a safe distance from all obstacles.

[09/09/2024 08:15:18 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issues are with the segments intersecting obstacles 3, 4, and 5.
3. We need to find a route that avoids these obstacles while maintaining a safe distance.

Let's plan a new path:

1. We'll start from (2.0, 2.0) as before.
2. Instead of going left, we'll go right to avoid obstacle 5.
3. We'll curve around obstacle 1 and 4 by going to the right of them.
4. Then we'll move upwards between obstacles 2 and 4.
5. Finally, we'll approach the goal from the right side.

Here's the new proposed path with explanations:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),   # Start point, same as before
    (6.0, 2.0),   # Move right to avoid obstacle 5
    (14.0, 2.0),  # Continue right, staying below obstacles 1 and 4
    (17.0, 2.0),  # Move further right to clear obstacle 4
    (17.0, 11.0), # Move up, staying to the right of obstacle 4
    (17.0, 17.0), # Continue moving up, staying right of obstacle 2
    (18.5, 18.5)  # Move to the goal point
]

Explanation of the path:
1. (2.0, 2.0) to (6.0, 2.0): This segment moves right, avoiding obstacle 5.
2. (6.0, 2.0) to (14.0, 2.0): This segment continues right, passing below obstacles 1 and 4.
3. (14.0, 2.0) to (17.0, 2.0): This segment moves further right to clear obstacle 4 completely.
4. (17.0, 2.0) to (17.0, 11.0): This vertical segment moves up, staying to the right of obstacle 4.
5. (17.0, 11.0) to (17.0, 17.0): This segment continues moving up, avoiding obstacle 2 on the left.
6. (17.0, 17.0) to (18.5, 18.5): This final segment moves diagonally to reach the goal point inside the goal set.

This path should avoid all obstacles while maintaining a safe distance from them. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set as required.

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/09/2024 08:15:27 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issue is the segment between (6.0, 2.0) and (14.0, 2.0) intersecting Obstacle 1.
3. We need to route around Obstacle 1, which extends from approximately y=0 to y=9.
4. There's a clear path above Obstacle 1 and below Obstacle 2.
5. We should also be cautious of Obstacle 4, which is in the upper-right quadrant of the space.
6. The path can go around Obstacle 1 to the left or right. Going left might be shorter.

New path proposal:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (6.0, 2.0),    # First waypoint (unchanged)
    (9.0, 2.0),    # Move right, staying below Obstacle 1
    (9.0, 10.0),   # Move up, clearing Obstacle 1
    (14.0, 10.0),  # Move right, staying below Obstacle 4
    (17.0, 10.0),  # Continue right, preparing to move up
    (17.0, 17.0),  # Move up, clearing Obstacle 4
    (18.5, 18.5)   # End point (unchanged)
]

Explanation of changes:
1. We keep the first two points as they are correct and don't intersect any obstacles.
2. Instead of going directly to (14.0, 2.0), we first move to (9.0, 2.0), which is just before Obstacle 1.
3. We then move upwards to (9.0, 10.0), which clears Obstacle 1 and stays below Obstacle 2.
4. From there, we move right to (14.0, 10.0) and then to (17.0, 10.0), staying below Obstacle 4.
5. Finally, we move up to (17.0, 17.0) and then to the goal point (18.5, 18.5).

This path should avoid all obstacles while maintaining a safe distance from them. It provides a clear route from the start to the goal, utilizing the open spaces between obstacles.
