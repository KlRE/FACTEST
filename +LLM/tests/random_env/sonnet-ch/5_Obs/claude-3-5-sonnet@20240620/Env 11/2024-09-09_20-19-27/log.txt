# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[16.3, 19.8], [16.4, 15.8], [17.5, 16.0], [16.6, 19.2]]
			Obstacle 2: [[8.4, 15.2], [19.3, 11.1], [12.6, 19.6], [9.1, 16.9]]
			Obstacle 3: [[7.3, 10.1], [11.8, 9.9], [14.4, 16.5], [8.2, 16.2]]
			Obstacle 4: [[11.5, 6.8], [14.3, 4.1], [13.8, 12.5], [12.7, 12.7]]
			Obstacle 5: [[8.6, 19.4], [11.3, 17.5], [19.4, 14.6], [18.1, 17.7]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]

[09/09/2024 08:19:32 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I've analyzed the environment and its spatial relationships to create a path that avoids all obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point within the start set
    (3.0, 1.0),    # Move right to avoid Obstacle 3
    (3.0, 8.0),    # Move up to avoid Obstacles 3 and 4
    (6.0, 8.0),    # Move right to avoid Obstacle 3
    (6.0, 13.0),   # Move up to avoid Obstacle 2
    (15.0, 13.0),  # Move right to avoid Obstacles 2 and 5
    (15.0, 17.0),  # Move up to avoid Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 17.0),  # Move right towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point within the goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set at (1.0, 1.0).
2. Navigates around Obstacles 3 and 4 by moving right and then up.
3. Avoids Obstacle 2 by moving further up before proceeding right.
4. Passes between Obstacles 2 and 5 by moving right at y=13.0.
5. Moves up to avoid Obstacle 1.
6. Finally approaches the goal set from the left, ending at (19.0, 19.0) which is within the goal set.

The path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles and does not cross or touch any of them. It consists of straight-line segments between waypoints, making it easy to follow and implement.

[09/09/2024 08:19:40 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issues are with segments 5, 6, and 7, which intersect multiple obstacles.
3. We need to find a way to navigate around the cluster of obstacles in the upper-right quadrant of the space.
4. There appears to be a corridor between obstacles 2 and 3 that we can use to approach the goal from the left side.
5. We should also keep the path further away from obstacles to ensure we don't touch them.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Start from the same point (1.0, 1.0) in the start set.
2. Instead of going directly east, we'll move northeast to avoid the lower obstacles.
3. We'll aim for the gap between obstacles 2 and 3, passing to the left of obstacle 4.
4. After passing through this gap, we'll move eastward, staying below obstacles 2 and 5.
5. Finally, we'll approach the goal set from the south, avoiding obstacle 1.

New path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point
    (5.0, 5.0),    # Move northeast to avoid lower obstacles
    (7.0, 9.0),    # Continue northeast, aiming for the gap between obstacles 2 and 3
    (10.0, 11.0),  # Pass through the gap
    (13.0, 11.0),  # Move east, staying below obstacles 2 and 5
    (16.0, 13.0),  # Continue east and slightly north, still below obstacle 5
    (18.0, 15.0),  # Approach the goal area from the south
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point in the goal set
]

This new path should avoid all obstacles while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. It takes a more circuitous route to navigate around the cluster of obstacles in the upper-right quadrant. The path now passes to the left of obstacle 4, through the gap between obstacles 2 and 3, and then approaches the goal from the south to avoid obstacles 1 and 5.

[09/09/2024 08:19:50 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issues are with segments 3 through 7, which intersect various obstacles.
3. We need to find a route that goes around the obstacles, particularly avoiding the central area where most intersections occur.

Spatial relationships:
1. There's a narrow passage between Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 4 in the lower left.
2. There's space between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 5 on the right side.
3. The upper left area is relatively clear of obstacles.

Strategy:
1. Start from the same point (1.0, 1.0).
2. Move towards the upper left to avoid the central cluster of obstacles.
3. Navigate through the space between Obstacle 3 and the left boundary.
4. Move rightwards above Obstacle 2 and 5.
5. Finally, approach the goal from above.

New path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point
    (3.0, 6.0),    # Move up and slightly right to avoid Obstacle 3
    (6.0, 8.0),    # Continue moving up and right, staying clear of Obstacle 3
    (7.0, 12.0),   # Move further up, avoiding the top of Obstacle 3
    (11.0, 17.0),  # Move diagonally, staying above Obstacle 2
    (15.0, 18.0),  # Continue moving right, above Obstacle 5
    (17.0, 19.0),  # Approach the goal area
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point within the goal set
]

Explanation:
1. The path starts at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start set.
2. It then moves up and slightly right to (3.0, 6.0), avoiding Obstacle 3.
3. The path continues upward to (6.0, 8.0) and (7.0, 12.0), staying clear of Obstacle 3's upper boundary.
4. From there, it moves diagonally to (11.0, 17.0), passing above Obstacle 2.
5. The path then continues rightward to (15.0, 18.0) and (17.0, 19.0), staying above Obstacle 5.
6. Finally, it reaches the goal at (19.0, 19.0), which is within the goal set.

This path should avoid all obstacles while meeting the start and end requirements. It takes a wider berth around the central cluster of obstacles, utilizing the clearer areas in the upper part of the space.

[09/09/2024 08:20:06 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issues occur in the middle segments of the path, particularly from waypoint 4 to 7.
3. We need to navigate around Obstacles 2, 3, and 5, which form a complex shape in the center-right of the space.
4. Obstacle 1 is near the goal, so we need to approach the goal carefully.

Let's adjust the path:

1. Keep the first three waypoints as they are safe.
2. Instead of going directly from (6.0, 8.0) to (7.0, 12.0), we'll add an intermediate point to go around Obstacle 3.
3. We'll then curve around to the left of Obstacle 2, staying clear of Obstacle 5.
4. Finally, we'll approach the goal from the left, avoiding Obstacle 1.

New path reasoning:
1. (1.0, 1.0) - Start point, inside the start set.
2. (3.0, 6.0) - Moves upward and right, clear of obstacles.
3. (6.0, 8.0) - Continues the trajectory, still clear.
4. (5.0, 13.0) - New point, moves up and slightly left to avoid Obstacle 3.
5. (7.0, 15.0) - Curves around the left side of Obstacle 2.
6. (10.0, 18.0) - Continues curving, staying clear of Obstacles 2 and 5.
7. (14.0, 19.5) - Moves right, above Obstacle 5, below Obstacle 1.
8. (17.0, 19.5) - Approaches goal from the left, avoiding Obstacle 1.
9. (19.0, 19.0) - End point, inside the goal set.

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (3.0, 6.0),
    (6.0, 8.0),
    (5.0, 13.0),
    (7.0, 15.0),
    (10.0, 18.0),
    (14.0, 19.5),
    (17.0, 19.5),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]

This new path should avoid all obstacles while maintaining a safe distance from them. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set, meeting all the specified requirements.

[09/09/2024 08:20:15 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issues are with segments 5, 6, and 7, which intersect with multiple obstacles.
3. We need to find a way around the cluster of obstacles in the upper right quadrant of the space.

Thought process for creating a new path:
1. Keep the first few waypoints as they don't intersect with any obstacles.
2. Instead of going directly towards the goal from (5.0, 13.0), we'll need to take a more circuitous route to avoid the obstacles.
3. We'll go further left before moving up to avoid Obstacle 3.
4. Then we'll move right, staying below Obstacles 2 and 5.
5. Finally, we'll approach the goal from below, avoiding Obstacle 1.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (3.0, 6.0),    # Second point (unchanged)
    (6.0, 8.0),    # Third point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 13.0),   # Fourth point (unchanged)
    (3.0, 15.0),   # Move left to avoid Obstacle 3
    (6.0, 17.0),   # Move up and slightly right, staying below Obstacles 2 and 5
    (12.0, 17.0),  # Move right, still below Obstacles 2 and 5
    (15.0, 17.0),  # Continue moving right, now below Obstacle 1
    (17.0, 18.0),  # Move slightly up and right, avoiding Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point in the goal set (unchanged)
]

This new path should avoid all obstacles while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. The path takes a wider berth around the cluster of obstacles in the upper right, first moving left and then approaching the goal from below. This should prevent any intersections with the obstacles while maintaining a smooth and feasible trajectory.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/09/2024 08:20:24 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and provide a revised path that avoids the obstacles while meeting the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issues are with segments 6, 7, and 8, which intersect with obstacles 1, 2, and 5.
3. We need to find a way around these obstacles while maintaining a safe distance.

Revised path reasoning:
1. Keep the initial part of the path up to point (6.0, 17.0) as it doesn't intersect with any obstacles.
2. To avoid Obstacle 2, we'll move the path more to the left, creating a detour around its western edge.
3. We'll then guide the path between Obstacles 2 and 5, maintaining a safe distance from both.
4. To avoid Obstacle 1, we'll move the path slightly to the west before approaching the goal set.

Here's the revised path with explanations:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (3.0, 6.0),    # Unchanged
    (6.0, 8.0),    # Unchanged
    (5.0, 13.0),   # Unchanged
    (3.0, 15.0),   # Unchanged
    (6.0, 17.0),   # Unchanged
    (7.0, 18.5),   # Move northwest to avoid Obstacle 2
    (8.0, 20.0),   # Continue north to stay clear of Obstacle 2
    (10.0, 20.5),  # Move slightly northeast, staying above Obstacle 2
    (13.0, 20.0),  # Continue east, staying above Obstacle 5
    (15.5, 19.0),  # Move southeast, between Obstacles 1 and 5
    (17.0, 18.5),  # Continue southeast, avoiding Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point in the goal set (unchanged)
]

This revised path should avoid all obstacles while maintaining a safe distance. It takes a more curved approach to navigate between the obstacles, especially in the problematic area near the goal set. The path starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and should not intersect with any of the defined obstacles.
