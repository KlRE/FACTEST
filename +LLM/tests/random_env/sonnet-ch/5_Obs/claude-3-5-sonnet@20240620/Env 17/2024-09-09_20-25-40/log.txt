# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[12.3, 11.1], [18.3, 8.4], [18.0, 11.2], [15.0, 17.6]]

			Obstacle 4: [[16.1, 15.5], [16.6, 15.7], [18.0, 17.9], [16.8, 17.4]]
			Obstacle 5: [[16.0, 12.4], [17.5, 9.6], [19.0, 14.1], [18.7, 16.6]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.

[09/09/2024 08:26:05 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and propose a path that meets the criteria.

The start position is a square from (0,0) to (2,2), and the goal is a square from (18,18) to (20,20). The obstacles are mostly concentrated in the upper right quadrant of the space, creating a challenging environment to navigate.

Analyzing the obstacle layout:
1. There's a clear path along the left and bottom edges of the space.
2. The obstacles create a narrow passage between them and the top/right edges.
3. We need to carefully navigate the space between obstacles 3, 4, and 5 to reach the goal.

Considering these factors, here's a proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start within the start set
    (1.0, 8.0),     # Move up, staying clear of obstacles
    (8.0, 8.0),     # Move right, below the obstacles
    (8.0, 16.0),    # Move up, to the left of the obstacles
    (13.0, 16.0),   # Move right, below obstacle 3
    (13.0, 18.5),   # Move up, between obstacles 3 and 4
    (15.5, 18.5),   # Move right, above obstacle 4
    (15.5, 17.5),   # Move down slightly, to pass between obstacles 4 and 5
    (17.5, 17.5),   # Move right, between obstacles 4 and 5
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End within the goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set.
2. Avoids all obstacles with a safe margin.
3. Navigates through the narrow passages created by the obstacles.
4. Ends within the goal set.
5. Uses straight-line segments between waypoints.

The path takes a somewhat circuitous route to ensure it stays clear of all obstacles, particularly in the crowded upper-right area of the space. It first moves up and then right to avoid the lower obstacles, then carefully weaves between the upper obstacles to reach the goal.

[09/09/2024 08:26:14 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles.

Analysis:
The main issue with the previous path was that segments 8 and 9 intersected with Obstacle 4. This obstacle is located near the goal set, making it challenging to reach the goal without careful maneuvering. Let's adjust the path to avoid this obstacle while still reaching the goal.

Thought process:
1. The start and end points of the path are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The first part of the path (up to point (13.0, 16.0)) seems to avoid obstacles successfully, so we can keep that portion.
3. We need to adjust the approach to the goal area to avoid Obstacle 4.
4. There appears to be a narrow passage between Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 4 that we can use.
5. After passing through this narrow passage, we can curve around Obstacle 4 to reach the goal.

New path proposal:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (1.0, 8.0),    # Move up (unchanged)
    (8.0, 8.0),    # Move right (unchanged)
    (8.0, 16.0),   # Move up (unchanged)
    (13.0, 16.0),  # Move right (unchanged)
    (14.0, 17.5),  # Move up and slightly right to approach the narrow passage
    (14.7, 18.0),  # Navigate through the narrow passage between Obstacle 3 and 4
    (15.5, 18.3),  # Continue moving through the passage
    (16.5, 18.7),  # Start curving around Obstacle 4
    (17.5, 19.0),  # Continue curving
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point in the goal set
]

Explanation of changes:
1. Instead of moving directly to (13.0, 18.5), we now move to (14.0, 17.5) to approach the narrow passage between Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 4.
2. We then carefully navigate through this passage with points (14.7, 18.0) and (15.5, 18.3), maintaining a safe distance from both obstacles.
3. After passing through the narrow area, we curve around Obstacle 4 with points (16.5, 18.7) and (17.5, 19.0).
4. Finally, we reach the goal point at (19.0, 19.0), which is within the goal set.

This new path should avoid all obstacles while still reaching the goal set. The curved approach around Obstacle 4 ensures that we don't intersect with it, addressing the main issue from the previous path.

[09/09/2024 08:26:23 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and provide a corrected path with explanations.

Analysis:
The main issue with the previous path is that segment 6, between points (14.0, 17.5) and (14.7, 18.0), intersects with Obstacle 3. To correct this, we need to adjust the path to go around Obstacle 3 while still avoiding the other obstacles.

Looking at the spatial relationships:
1. Obstacle 3 is positioned in the upper-right area of the map.
2. There's a narrow passage between Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 4.
3. We need to approach the goal set from the left or bottom to avoid Obstacle 3.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Keep the initial segments of the path as they are valid.
2. Instead of trying to pass above Obstacle 3, we'll go below it.
3. We'll add more waypoints to carefully navigate around Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 4.
4. Finally, we'll approach the goal set from the bottom-left.

Here's the new path with explanations:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (1.0, 8.0),    # Move up (unchanged)
    (8.0, 8.0),    # Move right (unchanged)
    (8.0, 16.0),   # Move up (unchanged)
    (13.0, 16.0),  # Move right (unchanged)
    (14.0, 16.0),  # Slight move right to prepare for avoiding Obstacle 3
    (14.2, 15.5),  # Move down slightly to pass below Obstacle 3
    (15.5, 15.0),  # Move diagonally to navigate between Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 4
    (16.5, 15.5),  # Move up slightly to clear Obstacle 4
    (17.5, 16.5),  # Move diagonally up-right to approach the goal set
    (18.5, 17.5),  # Continue moving diagonally up-right
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Final point in the goal set
]

This new path should avoid all obstacles while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. The adjustments made ensure that we navigate around Obstacle 3 without intersecting it, and also maintain a safe distance from the other obstacles.

[09/09/2024 08:26:31 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issue is with the path segments from (14.0, 16.0) to (18.5, 17.5), which intersect with Obstacles 1 and 3.
3. We need to find a way around these obstacles while maintaining a safe distance.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Keep the initial segments up to (13.0, 16.0) as they don't intersect with any obstacles.
2. To avoid Obstacle 1, we need to go further north before moving east.
3. We'll add a point at (13.0, 17.5) to stay above Obstacle 1.
4. Then, we'll move east to (17.0, 17.5), which should keep us above Obstacles 1, 3, 4, and 5.
5. From there, we can move northeast to reach the goal set, avoiding Obstacle 3.

New path proposal:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (1.0, 8.0),    # Move north (unchanged)
    (8.0, 8.0),    # Move east (unchanged)
    (8.0, 16.0),   # Move north (unchanged)
    (13.0, 16.0),  # Move east (unchanged)
    (13.0, 17.5),  # Move north to avoid Obstacle 1
    (17.0, 17.5),  # Move east, staying above Obstacles 1, 3, 4, and 5
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move northeast to the goal set
]

This new path should avoid all obstacles while maintaining a safe distance. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set. The path takes a wider berth around the problematic obstacles, particularly Obstacles 1 and 3, by moving further north before heading east and then northeast to the goal.

[09/09/2024 08:26:39 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
The main issue with the previous path was that segment 6, between points (13.0, 17.5) and (17.0, 17.5), intersected with Obstacles 1 and 3. To correct this, we need to find a way around these obstacles while still reaching the goal set.

Spatial analysis:
1. There's a narrow passage between Obstacles 3 and 4.
2. Obstacle 5 is positioned below Obstacles 3 and 4, creating a potential path above it.
3. We can maintain most of the initial path up to point (13.0, 16.0) as it doesn't intersect with any obstacles.

New path planning:
1. Keep the initial part of the path up to (13.0, 16.0).
2. Instead of moving directly east, we'll go northeast to avoid Obstacle 1.
3. Navigate through the narrow passage between Obstacles 3 and 4.
4. Finally, move towards the goal set.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (1.0, 8.0),    # Move north (unchanged)
    (8.0, 8.0),    # Move east (unchanged)
    (8.0, 16.0),   # Move north (unchanged)
    (13.0, 16.0),  # Move east (unchanged)
    (14.0, 17.0),  # Move northeast to avoid Obstacle 1
    (15.5, 18.5),  # Continue northeast to pass between Obstacles 3 and 4
    (17.5, 18.5),  # Move east through the narrow passage
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Final move to the goal set
]

This new path should:
1. Start in the correct start set
2. Avoid all obstacles by maintaining a safe distance
3. End in the correct goal set
4. Consist of linear segments that don't intersect with any obstacles

The path now takes a more careful approach when navigating the cluttered area near the goal, using the narrow passage between Obstacles 3 and 4 to reach the goal safely.

[09/09/2024 08:26:48 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a corrected path that avoids all obstacles while meeting the start and end requirements.

Analysis:
The main issue with the previous path is that segment 6, between (14.0, 17.0) and (15.5, 18.5), intersects with Obstacle 3. To correct this, we need to route the path around Obstacle 3 while also ensuring we don't create new conflicts with other obstacles.

Let's break down the spatial relationships:
1. Obstacles 1 and 2 are in the lower half of the space, creating a diagonal barrier.
2. Obstacles 3, 4, and 5 are in the upper right quadrant, near the goal.
3. There's a clear path from the start to about (13, 16), which we can keep.
4. We need to carefully navigate around Obstacles 3, 4, and 5 to reach the goal.

Proposed changes:
1. Keep the initial part of the path up to (13.0, 16.0).
2. Instead of going directly towards (15.5, 18.5), we'll go around Obstacle 3 by first moving slightly down and right.
3. Then we'll move up along the right side of Obstacle 3, keeping a safe distance.
4. Finally, we'll approach the goal from the right, avoiding Obstacles 4 and 5.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (1.0, 8.0),    # Move up (unchanged)
    (8.0, 8.0),    # Move right (unchanged)
    (8.0, 16.0),   # Move up (unchanged)
    (13.0, 16.0),  # Move right (unchanged)
    (14.0, 15.5),  # Move slightly down and right to avoid Obstacle 3
    (15.5, 15.5),  # Move right, staying below Obstacle 3
    (20.0, 15.5),  # Move right, clearing all obstacles
    (20.0, 18.5),  # Move up along the right edge
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move slightly left and up to end in the goal set
]

This new path should avoid all obstacles while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. The key changes are:
1. Moving down slightly at (14.0, 15.5) to avoid Obstacle 3.
2. Going around Obstacle 3 to the right instead of trying to go over it.
3. Using the right edge of the space to safely move up towards the goal.
4. Approaching the goal from the right side to avoid any potential conflicts with Obstacles 4 and 5.

This path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles and should resolve the intersection issue identified in the feedback.
