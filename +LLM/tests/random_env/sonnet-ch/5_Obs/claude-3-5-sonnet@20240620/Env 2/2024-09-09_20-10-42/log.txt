# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.9, 16.0], [18.1, 15.3], [19.2, 17.6], [17.6, 17.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[15.7, 15.5], [16.5, 7.0], [19.0, 16.8], [18.2, 16.7]]
			Obstacle 3: [[6.0, 13.8], [1.1, 10.5], [9.8, 1.4], [14.2, 3.9]]
			Obstacle 4: [[7.3, 17.0], [10.5, 10.6], [17.0, 7.3], [10.3, 16.6]]
			Obstacle 5: [[2.6, 10.7], [13.7, 13.3], [14.8, 16.7], [5.9, 13.7]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.

[09/09/2024 08:10:48 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and propose a path that avoids all obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set.

Analysis:
1. The start set is near the bottom-left corner of the space.
2. The goal set is in the top-right corner.
3. There are five obstacles scattered across the space, creating a complex environment.
4. We need to find a path that navigates around these obstacles, maintaining a safe distance.

Path Strategy:
1. Start from the center of the start set.
2. Move upwards to avoid Obstacle 3.
3. Navigate between Obstacles 3 and 5, then between 4 and 5.
4. Move towards the top-right, avoiding Obstacles 1 and 2.
5. Finally, approach the goal set from the left.

Proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start in the center of the start set
    (1.0, 5.0),    # Move up to avoid Obstacle 3
    (4.0, 11.0),   # Navigate between Obstacles 3 and 5
    (8.0, 14.0),   # Move between Obstacles 4 and 5
    (12.0, 17.0),  # Continue moving up and right
    (15.0, 18.5),  # Position to approach the goal while avoiding Obstacles 1 and 2
    (17.5, 19.0),  # Move closer to the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End in the goal set
]

This path starts within the start set, ends within the goal set, and should maintain a safe distance from all obstacles. The waypoints are chosen to create a smooth path that avoids sharp turns while navigating through the complex obstacle arrangement.

[09/09/2024 08:11:08 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct, so we can keep them.
2. The main issues were with segments 2, 3, and 4, which intersected multiple obstacles.
3. We need to find a route that avoids Obstacles 3, 4, and 5, which are clustered in the center-left of the space.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Start from (1.0, 1.0) in the start set.
2. Instead of going straight towards the center, we'll move to the right first to avoid Obstacle 3.
3. Then, we'll move upwards, staying to the right of Obstacles 3 and 4.
4. We'll curve around the top of Obstacle 4, keeping a safe distance.
5. Finally, we'll approach the goal set from above, avoiding Obstacles 1 and 2.

Here's the proposed new path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point
    (5.0, 1.0),    # Move right to avoid Obstacle 3
    (11.0, 5.0),   # Move up and right, staying clear of Obstacles 3 and 4
    (14.0, 10.0),  # Continue moving up, keeping distance from Obstacle 4
    (16.0, 15.0),  # Move towards the goal, avoiding Obstacles 1 and 2
    (17.0, 17.0),  # Approach the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point in the goal set
]

Explanation of the path:
1. The path starts at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start set.
2. By moving to (5.0, 1.0), we avoid Obstacle 3 entirely.
3. The segment from (5.0, 1.0) to (11.0, 5.0) passes safely below Obstacle 3 and to the left of Obstacle 4.
4. Moving to (14.0, 10.0) keeps us clear of Obstacle 4's top-left corner.
5. The point (16.0, 15.0) is chosen to stay above Obstacle 5 and to the left of Obstacles 1 and 2.
6. (17.0, 17.0) is a safe point that avoids all obstacles and prepares for the final approach to the goal.
7. The path ends at (19.0, 19.0), which is within the goal set.

This path should avoid all obstacles while meeting the start and end requirements. It takes a wider route around the obstacles, which increases safety but may result in a longer overall path. If a shorter path is preferred, we could potentially add more waypoints to navigate closer to the obstacles while still maintaining a safe distance.

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]

[09/09/2024 08:11:18 PM] Thank you for the feedback and example. I'll analyze the environment and provide a new path that avoids all obstacles while meeting the start and end requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start area is in the bottom-left corner (0,0 to 2,2).
2. The goal area is in the top-right corner (18,18 to 20,20).
3. Obstacle 3 and 4 create a significant barrier in the middle of the space.
4. There's a narrow passage between Obstacle 5 and Obstacle 3.
5. The top-right area near the goal is congested with Obstacles 1 and 2.

Path planning strategy:
1. Start from the top-right of the start area to gain height early.
2. Move towards the gap between Obstacle 5 and Obstacle 3.
3. Navigate around Obstacle 4 from its left side.
4. Approach the goal from the left, avoiding Obstacles 1 and 2.

New path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),  # Start at the top-right of the start area
    (2.5, 8.0),  # Move up, staying left of Obstacle 5
    (4.0, 11.0),  # Continue up, aiming for the gap between Obstacle 5 and 3
    (6.0, 14.5),  # Pass through the gap, staying above Obstacle 3
    (9.0, 16.0),  # Move right, staying above Obstacle 4
    (13.0, 17.5),  # Continue right and slightly up, avoiding Obstacle 4's top
    (15.5, 17.5),  # Approach the goal area from the left
    (17.0, 18.5),  # Carefully move between Obstacles 1 and 2
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End in the goal area
]

Explanation:
1. The path starts at (2.0, 2.0), which is within the start set.
2. It then moves upward to (2.5, 8.0), avoiding Obstacle 5 on the right.
3. The path continues to (4.0, 11.0) and (6.0, 14.5), passing through the gap between Obstacles 3 and 5.
4. It then navigates around Obstacle 4 by moving to (9.0, 16.0) and (13.0, 17.5), staying above the obstacle.
5. The path approaches the goal area from the left, moving to (15.5, 17.5) to avoid Obstacles 1 and 2.
6. It carefully passes between Obstacles 1 and 2 at (17.0, 18.5).
7. Finally, it ends at (19.0, 19.0), which is within the goal set.

This path should avoid all obstacles while meeting the start and end requirements. The additional waypoints help navigate around the complex obstacle arrangement, especially in the congested areas near the start and goal.

[09/09/2024 08:11:26 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and adjust the path accordingly.

Analysis and Thought Process:

1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.

2. The main issue is that the path intersects with several obstacles, particularly Obstacles 3, 4, and 5.

3. We need to find a route that avoids these obstacles while maintaining a safe distance from them.

4. Looking at the obstacle layout, there seems to be a potential path between Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 5, then moving upwards between Obstacle 4 and Obstacle 2.

5. We'll need to add more waypoints to navigate around these obstacles safely.

6. The path should curve around Obstacle 3 to the left, then move upwards between Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 5.

7. After passing Obstacle 5, the path should curve to the right to avoid Obstacle 4.

8. Finally, it should move upwards between Obstacle 4 and Obstacle 2 to reach the goal.

Based on this analysis, here's the adjusted path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),     # Start point (unchanged)
    (2.0, 6.0),     # Move up to avoid Obstacle 3
    (0.5, 9.0),     # Move left to go around Obstacle 3
    (3.0, 12.0),    # Move up and right between Obstacle 3 and 5
    (5.0, 15.0),    # Continue moving up and right
    (8.0, 17.0),    # Move right to avoid Obstacle 4
    (12.0, 18.0),   # Continue moving right and slightly up
    (15.0, 18.5),   # Move further right, staying above Obstacle 2
    (17.0, 19.0),   # Approach the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End point in the goal set
]

This new path should avoid all obstacles while maintaining a safe distance from them. It starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and navigates through the space by taking advantage of the gaps between obstacles. The additional waypoints allow for more precise navigation around the complex obstacle layout.

[09/09/2024 08:11:36 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issues are with segments 3 and 5, which intersect with obstacles 3 and 4 respectively.
3. We need to adjust the path to go around these obstacles while maintaining a safe distance from all obstacles.

Thought process for adjustments:
1. To avoid obstacle 3, we need to move the path more to the left or above it.
2. To avoid obstacle 4, we need to go around it, either above or below.
3. We should also consider obstacles 2 and 5 when planning the new route.
4. It seems safer to go above obstacles 3 and 4, as there's more open space in that area.

New path proposal:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (2.0, 6.0),    # Move up (unchanged)
    (1.0, 11.0),   # Adjusted to go left of obstacle 3
    (3.0, 15.0),   # Move up and slightly right, avoiding obstacle 5
    (6.0, 18.0),   # Go above obstacle 4
    (10.0, 19.0),  # Continue moving right, staying above obstacles
    (14.0, 19.5),  # Approach the goal from above
    (17.0, 19.5),  # Move closer to the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point (unchanged)
]

Explanation of changes:
1. The first two points remain the same as they don't cause any issues.
2. Instead of going to (0.5, 9.0), we now go to (1.0, 11.0) to stay clear of obstacle 3.
3. We then move to (3.0, 15.0) to avoid obstacle 5 and prepare to go above obstacle 4.
4. The point (6.0, 18.0) ensures we stay above obstacle 4.
5. We continue with a series of points (10.0, 19.0), (14.0, 19.5), and (17.0, 19.5) to maintain a safe distance from all obstacles while approaching the goal.
6. The final point remains the same, ending correctly in the goal set.

This new path should avoid all obstacles while maintaining a safe distance from them. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set as required.
