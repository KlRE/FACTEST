# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.6, 15.9], [10.7, 16.1], [10.1, 18.5], [5.1, 17.7]]
			Obstacle 2: [[9.3, 7.5], [13.6, 7.5], [13.5, 11.0], [10.0, 14.1]]
			Obstacle 3: [[11.5, 14.4], [18.1, 1.5], [17.5, 7.3], [16.4, 12.5]]
			Obstacle 4: [[16.5, 12.8], [17.9, 10.7], [17.5, 11.6], [16.7, 13.2]]
			Obstacle 5: [[6.5, 16.5], [16.4, 17.7], [16.1, 18.4], [14.6, 19.8]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

[09/09/2024 08:28:11 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll create a path that avoids the obstacles while moving from the start set to the goal set. Let's analyze the environment:

1. The start set is in the bottom-left corner, and the goal set is in the top-right corner.
2. There are several obstacles in between, forming a complex environment.
3. We need to find a path that navigates around these obstacles while maintaining a safe distance.

After analyzing the obstacle layout, here's a proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start set
    (1.0, 5.0),  # Move upwards to avoid Obstacle 2
    (8.0, 5.0),  # Move right, staying below Obstacle 1
    (8.0, 15.0),  # Move up, staying to the left of Obstacle 3
    (15.0, 15.0),  # Move right, above Obstacles 2 and 3, below Obstacle 5
    (15.0, 19.0),  # Move up, to the right of Obstacle 5
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End within the goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set at (1.0, 1.0).
2. Moves upward to avoid Obstacle 2.
3. Moves right, staying below Obstacle 1.
4. Goes up between Obstacles 1 and 3.
5. Moves right above Obstacles 2 and 3, while staying below Obstacle 5.
6. Finally moves up and right to reach the goal set, ending at (19.0, 19.0).

This path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles and provides a clear route from the start to the goal set. The waypoints are chosen to create straight-line segments that don't intersect with any obstacles.

[09/09/2024 08:28:20 PM] Thank you for the feedback. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct.
2. The main issue is with the final approach to the goal, where segments 5 and 6 intersect with Obstacle 5.
3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 5 to reach the goal.

Let's adjust the path:

1. We'll keep the initial segments of the path up to (8.0, 15.0) as they don't intersect with any obstacles.
2. From (8.0, 15.0), we need to move towards the goal while avoiding Obstacle 5.
3. We can go around Obstacle 5 by moving to the right, then up, and finally approaching the goal from the right side.

Here's the thought process for the new path:

1. Start at (1.0, 1.0) within the start set.
2. Move up to (1.0, 5.0) to avoid Obstacle 2.
3. Move right to (8.0, 5.0), staying below Obstacle 2.
4. Move up to (8.0, 15.0), staying to the left of Obstacle 3.
5. Move right to (17.0, 15.0), going above Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 4.
6. Move up to (17.0, 20.0), staying to the right of Obstacle 5.
7. Finally, move left to (19.0, 19.0), entering the goal set from the top-right corner.

This path should avoid all obstacles while reaching the goal. Here's the new path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (1.0, 5.0),
    (8.0, 5.0),
    (8.0, 15.0),
    (17.0, 15.0),
    (17.0, 20.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]

This new path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles, especially Obstacle 5, by going around it to the right instead of trying to pass through or over it. The final approach to the goal is now from the top-right, avoiding any intersection with Obstacle 5.
