# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[18.9, 14.1], [18.4, 6.0], [19.3, 8.5], [19.9, 10.6]]
			Obstacle 2: [[15.1, 14.1], [18.6, 16.8], [16.7, 16.7], [16.1, 15.9]]
			Obstacle 3: [[15.3, 8.8], [16.7, 1.6], [18.1, 10.4], [17.6, 11.1]]
			Obstacle 4: [[8.8, 18.5], [1.1, 15.1], [6.6, 10.2], [13.1, 13.3]]
			Obstacle 5: [[10.3, 17.4], [17.1, 8.2], [17.9, 8.9], [16.2, 14.7]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.

[09/09/2024 08:27:05 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and propose a path that avoids obstacles while connecting the start and goal positions.

Analysis:
1. The start position is a square from (0,0) to (2,2).
2. The goal position is a square from (18,18) to (20,20).
3. There are 5 obstacles between the start and goal, forming a complex environment.
4. A path needs to be found that avoids all obstacles while connecting start and goal.

Path planning:
1. Start from the top-right corner of the start square to maximize initial distance from obstacles.
2. Move diagonally up and right to avoid the lower obstacles.
3. Navigate between obstacles 3 and 5, then between 2 and 5.
4. Approach the goal from the bottom-left to avoid obstacle 1.

Proposed path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Start at top-right corner of start square
    (7.0, 7.0),    # Move diagonally to avoid lower obstacles
    (12.0, 12.0),  # Continue diagonal movement
    (15.0, 15.0),  # Position between obstacles 2, 3, and 5
    (17.0, 17.0),  # Move towards goal, avoiding obstacle 1
    (18.0, 18.0)   # Enter goal area at bottom-left corner
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set
2. Ends within the goal set
3. Avoids all obstacles with a safe margin
4. Uses diagonal movements to efficiently navigate the space
5. Adjusts course to pass between obstacles safely

The path maintains a distance from obstacles to ensure it doesn't touch or cross them. The linear segments between waypoints have been carefully chosen to avoid intersecting with any obstacle.

[09/09/2024 08:27:15 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analyzing the environment:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issue is with segments 3 and 4, which intersect with Obstacle 5.
3. Obstacle 5 is positioned diagonally from the bottom-left to the top-right, blocking a direct path.
4. There's a clear space between Obstacles 4 and 5 that we can use to navigate around.
5. We need to be cautious of Obstacle 2, which is close to the goal area.

Proposed solution:
1. Keep the first two waypoints (2.0, 2.0) and (7.0, 7.0) as they don't intersect with any obstacles.
2. Instead of going directly to (12.0, 12.0), we'll add a waypoint to navigate around Obstacle 5.
3. We'll then add another waypoint to ensure we don't get too close to Obstacle 2.
4. Finally, we'll adjust the approach to the goal to avoid any potential intersections.

Here's the new proposed path with explanations:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (7.0, 7.0),    # Second point (unchanged)
    (9.0, 11.0),   # New point to avoid Obstacle 5 by going above it
    (13.0, 14.0),  # New point to further avoid Obstacle 5 and prepare for goal approach
    (16.0, 16.5),  # New point to stay clear of Obstacle 2
    (18.0, 18.0)   # End point in the goal set (unchanged)
]

Explanation of changes:
1. The new point (9.0, 11.0) helps us navigate above Obstacle 5, avoiding the intersection we had before.
2. The point (13.0, 14.0) keeps us clear of Obstacle 5 as we move towards the goal area.
3. The point (16.0, 16.5) ensures we stay above Obstacle 2 and approach the goal from a safe angle.
4. This path should now avoid all obstacles while still starting and ending in the correct sets.

This new path takes a slightly longer route but ensures that we don't intersect with any obstacles. It makes use of the clear space between Obstacles 4 and 5, and then carefully navigates around Obstacle 2 to reach the goal. The additional waypoints provide more control over the path's trajectory, allowing for smoother navigation around the obstacles.

[09/09/2024 08:27:32 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and provide a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issues are with segments 3 and 4, which intersect with obstacles 4 and 5.
3. Obstacle 4 is positioned in the lower left part of the path, while Obstacle 5 stretches diagonally from the bottom right to the top left.
4. We need to find a way to navigate around these obstacles while maintaining a safe distance.

Thought process for creating a new path:
1. Keep the first two waypoints (2.0, 2.0) and (7.0, 7.0) as they don't intersect with any obstacles.
2. Instead of going directly to (9.0, 11.0), we'll add an intermediate point to go around Obstacle 4 from the left side.
3. We'll then add more waypoints to navigate between Obstacles 4 and 5, keeping a safe distance from both.
4. Finally, we'll adjust the approach to the goal set to avoid Obstacle 2.

Based on this analysis, here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Start point
    (7.0, 7.0),    # Same as before, no obstacles here
    (5.0, 12.0),   # Move up to avoid Obstacle 4
    (7.0, 15.0),   # Continue moving up and slightly right
    (11.0, 17.0),  # Move right, staying above Obstacle 5
    (14.0, 18.0),  # Continue moving right and slightly up
    (17.0, 19.0),  # Approach the goal set from above
    (18.0, 18.0)   # End point in the goal set
]

Explanation of the new path:
1. The path starts at (2.0, 2.0) within the start set.
2. It maintains the initial direction towards (7.0, 7.0).
3. Instead of going towards the previous (9.0, 11.0) which caused intersection, it now moves to (5.0, 12.0) to avoid Obstacle 4 from the left.
4. The path then moves to (7.0, 15.0) and (11.0, 17.0), navigating between Obstacles 4 and 5 while maintaining a safe distance from both.
5. It continues to (14.0, 18.0) and (17.0, 19.0), staying above Obstacle 5 and approaching the goal set from above to avoid Obstacle 2.
6. Finally, it ends at (18.0, 18.0), which is within the goal set.

This new path should avoid all obstacles while meeting the start and end position requirements. The additional waypoints allow for more precise navigation around the obstacles, reducing the risk of intersection.

[09/09/2024 08:27:40 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting the requirements.

Analysis of the environment and spatial relationships:

1. The start and goal positions are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issue is with obstacles 4 and 5, which are blocking the direct path to the goal.
3. Obstacle 4 is large and positioned in the center-left of the space, while Obstacle 5 is more to the right and upper part.
4. There seems to be a passage between Obstacles 4 and 5, which we can utilize.
5. Obstacles 1, 2, and 3 are closer to the goal area, so we need to navigate around them as well.

Proposed changes to the path:

1. Keep the starting point at (2.0, 2.0).
2. Instead of going directly towards the center, we'll move more to the right to avoid Obstacle 4.
3. We'll then navigate through the passage between Obstacles 4 and 5.
4. After passing through, we'll move upwards and then to the right to avoid Obstacles 1, 2, and 3.
5. Finally, we'll approach the goal from the left side.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Start point
    (7.0, 5.0),    # Move right and slightly up to avoid Obstacle 4
    (9.0, 8.0),    # Continue moving up and right
    (12.0, 12.0),  # Pass through the gap between Obstacles 4 and 5
    (14.0, 15.0),  # Move upwards to avoid Obstacles 1, 2, and 3
    (16.0, 17.0),  # Continue moving up and slightly right
    (17.5, 18.5),  # Approach the goal from the left
    (18.0, 18.0)   # End point in the goal set
]

This path should avoid all obstacles while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. The waypoints are chosen to give a good clearance from all obstacles, reducing the risk of intersection or touching. The path takes a more curved approach, utilizing the available space to navigate around the obstacles safely.

[09/09/2024 08:27:48 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issue is with segments 4 and 5, which intersect with obstacles 4 and 5.
3. We need to find a way around these obstacles while maintaining a safe distance.

Let's adjust the path:

1. Keep the first three waypoints as they are safe: (2.0, 2.0), (7.0, 5.0), (9.0, 8.0)
2. From (9.0, 8.0), we need to avoid obstacle 5. We can do this by moving more to the left before going up.
3. We'll add a point around (8.0, 11.0) to stay clear of obstacle 5.
4. Then, we'll move towards (11.0, 15.0) to pass between obstacles 4 and 5.
5. From there, we can safely move towards (15.0, 17.0), which is above obstacle 2.
6. Finally, we'll approach the goal set from above, ending at (18.0, 18.0).

Based on this analysis, here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Start point
    (7.0, 5.0),    # Safe waypoint
    (9.0, 8.0),    # Safe waypoint
    (8.0, 11.0),   # New point to avoid obstacle 5
    (11.0, 15.0),  # Pass between obstacles 4 and 5
    (15.0, 17.0),  # Above obstacle 2
    (18.0, 18.0)   # End point in goal set
]

This path should avoid all obstacles while maintaining a safe distance. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set. The new waypoints are strategically placed to navigate around the problematic areas identified in the feedback.

The path now takes a slightly longer route, but it ensures obstacle avoidance. It moves left and up to avoid obstacle 5, then passes between obstacles 4 and 5 before approaching the goal from above. This should resolve the intersection issues while keeping the path smooth and efficient.

[09/09/2024 08:28:05 PM] Thank you for the feedback. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles.

Analysis:
1. The main issue is with Obstacle 4, which is blocking the direct path from the start to the goal.
2. Obstacle 5 also presents a challenge in the upper-right quadrant of the space.
3. There seems to be a clear path along the left side of the space, then curving upwards to the goal.

Let's plan a new path:

1. Start from (2.0, 2.0) in the start set.
2. Move towards the left side of the space to avoid Obstacle 4.
3. Curve upwards, keeping a safe distance from Obstacle 4.
4. Navigate between Obstacles 4 and 5.
5. Approach the goal set from the left, avoiding Obstacles 2 and 5.

New path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),   # Start point
    (5.0, 3.0),   # Move slightly up and left
    (3.0, 7.0),   # Continue moving left and up, avoiding Obstacle 4
    (5.0, 12.0),  # Start curving right, still avoiding Obstacle 4
    (8.0, 16.0),  # Navigate between Obstacles 4 and 5
    (12.0, 18.0), # Move towards the goal, avoiding Obstacle 2
    (15.0, 19.0), # Approach the goal set
    (18.0, 19.0)  # End in the goal set
]

Reasoning:
1. The first segment (2.0, 2.0) to (5.0, 3.0) moves away from all obstacles.
2. The second segment to (3.0, 7.0) keeps us well clear of Obstacle 4 on the left side.
3. The third segment to (5.0, 12.0) continues to curve around Obstacle 4.
4. The fourth segment to (8.0, 16.0) navigates the gap between Obstacles 4 and 5.
5. The fifth segment to (12.0, 18.0) moves towards the goal while staying above Obstacle 5.
6. The sixth segment to (15.0, 19.0) continues approaching the goal, avoiding Obstacle 2.
7. The final segment to (18.0, 19.0) enters the goal set.

This path should avoid all obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. It takes a wider berth around the obstacles, particularly Obstacle 4, which was causing the most issues in the previous path.
