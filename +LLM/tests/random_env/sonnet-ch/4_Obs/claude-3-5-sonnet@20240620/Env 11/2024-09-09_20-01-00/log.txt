# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[14.9, 18.4], [13.3, 11.5], [15.9, 16.0], [16.0, 17.7]]
			Obstacle 2: [[6.8, 16.6], [17.8, 16.7], [17.2, 18.0], [10.9, 17.4]]
			Obstacle 3: [[15.8, 17.1], [15.2, 13.2], [16.0, 12.1], [17.7, 16.4]]
			Obstacle 4: [[9.5, 13.0], [8.9, 5.8], [15.9, 6.8], [19.0, 12.9]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]

[09/09/2024 08:01:06 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll create a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids all obstacles. Let's analyze the environment:

1. The start area is in the bottom-left corner (0,0 to 2,2).
2. The goal area is in the top-right corner (18,18 to 20,20).
3. There are four obstacles, mainly concentrated in the upper-right quadrant of the space.
4. There's a clear path along the left and bottom sides of the space.

Considering these factors, here's a suitable path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point within the start set
    (1.0, 8.0),    # Move up, avoiding Obstacle 4
    (8.0, 8.0),    # Move right, staying below Obstacle 2
    (8.0, 15.0),   # Move up, avoiding Obstacle 2
    (13.0, 15.0),  # Move right, staying below Obstacle 2
    (13.0, 19.0),  # Move up, avoiding Obstacles 1 and 3
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point within the goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set.
2. Ends within the goal set.
3. Avoids all obstacles with a safe margin.
4. Uses straight line segments between waypoints.
5. Does not cross any obstacles.

The path first moves upward along the left side of the space, then moves right below the obstacles, and finally navigates around the obstacles to reach the goal area. This approach provides a clear and safe route through the space while meeting all the specified requirements.

[09/09/2024 08:01:14 PM] Thank you for the feedback. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct.
2. The main issue is with the segment between (13.0, 15.0) and (13.0, 19.0), which intersects Obstacle 2.
3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 2 while also avoiding the other obstacles.

Spatial relationships:
1. Obstacle 2 is a horizontal barrier extending from about x=6.8 to x=17.8 at y≈16.6-18.0.
2. There's a narrow passage between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3 around x=17.5-18.0.
3. Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3 create a vertical barrier around x=15-16, but there's space to pass on either side.

New path planning:
1. Keep the initial segments up to (13.0, 15.0) as they don't intersect any obstacles.
2. Instead of going straight up from (13.0, 15.0), we'll move right to avoid Obstacle 2.
3. We'll aim for the gap between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3, around (17.5, 15.0).
4. From there, we can move up to clear Obstacle 2, then left and up to reach the goal area.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (1.0, 8.0),    # Unchanged
    (8.0, 8.0),    # Unchanged
    (8.0, 15.0),   # Unchanged
    (13.0, 15.0),  # Unchanged
    (17.5, 15.0),  # Move right to avoid Obstacle 2
    (17.5, 18.5),  # Move up to clear Obstacle 2
    (18.5, 18.5),  # Move slightly right to enter goal area
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point in goal area (unchanged)
]

This path should avoid all obstacles while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. The new segments go around Obstacle 2 by using the gap between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3, then moving up and slightly right to reach the goal area.

[09/09/2024 08:01:22 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path are correct, so we can keep those.
2. The main issues are with segments 5 and 6, which intersect with multiple obstacles.
3. We need to find a way around the cluster of obstacles in the upper-right quadrant of the space.

Let's break down the path and make necessary adjustments:

1. The path from (1.0, 1.0) to (8.0, 15.0) is clear of obstacles, so we can keep these segments.
2. From (8.0, 15.0), we need to navigate around the obstacles to reach the goal.
3. We can go slightly higher to avoid Obstacle 2, then move right, and finally approach the goal from above.

Here's the thought process for the new path:

1. Keep the initial segments up to (8.0, 15.0).
2. Move up to (8.0, 19.0) to clear Obstacle 2.
3. Move right to (18.0, 19.0), staying above all obstacles.
4. From here, we can safely move down to enter the goal set.

Based on this analysis, here's the proposed new path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (same as before)
    (1.0, 8.0),    # Move up (same as before)
    (8.0, 8.0),    # Move right (same as before)
    (8.0, 15.0),   # Move up (same as before)
    (8.0, 19.0),   # Move further up to clear Obstacle 2
    (18.0, 19.0),  # Move right, staying above all obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move slightly right and down to enter the goal set
]

This path should avoid all obstacles while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. It takes a wider berth around the cluster of obstacles in the upper-right quadrant, ensuring that no line segments intersect with any obstacles.

[09/09/2024 08:01:30 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path are correct.
2. The main issue is the segment between (8.0, 15.0) and (8.0, 19.0), which intersects with Obstacle 2.
3. We need to route the path around Obstacle 2, which extends from approximately x=6.8 to x=17.8 at y≈16.6-18.0.
4. There's a narrow passage between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3 that we can utilize.
5. We should also maintain a safe distance from all obstacles.

Proposed changes:
1. Keep the initial segments up to (8.0, 15.0) as they are valid.
2. Instead of going straight up from (8.0, 15.0), we'll move right to avoid Obstacle 2.
3. We'll then navigate through the gap between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3.
4. Finally, we'll move up and then left to reach the goal area.

New path explanation:
1. (1.0, 1.0) to (1.0, 8.0) to (8.0, 8.0) to (8.0, 15.0): These segments remain unchanged as they don't intersect with any obstacles.
2. (8.0, 15.0) to (12.0, 15.0): Move right to avoid Obstacle 2.
3. (12.0, 15.0) to (14.5, 15.0): Continue moving right, staying below Obstacle 2.
4. (14.5, 15.0) to (14.5, 17.5): Move up through the gap between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3.
5. (14.5, 17.5) to (14.5, 19.0): Continue moving up, now clear of all obstacles.
6. (14.5, 19.0) to (19.0, 19.0): Move right to enter the goal area.

This path should avoid all obstacles while maintaining a safe distance from them.

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (1.0, 8.0),
    (8.0, 8.0),
    (8.0, 15.0),
    (12.0, 15.0),
    (14.5, 15.0),
    (14.5, 17.5),
    (14.5, 19.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]

This new path should satisfy all the requirements: it starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids all obstacles while maintaining a safe distance from them.

[09/09/2024 08:01:38 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The main issue is with segments 5, 6, and 7, which intersect with Obstacles 1 and 2.
2. We need to find a way around these obstacles while maintaining a safe distance.
3. There appears to be a narrow passage between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3, which we can utilize.
4. We should also consider the space above Obstacle 2 for the final approach to the goal.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Keep the initial segments (1-4) as they are valid and don't intersect with obstacles.
2. Instead of moving directly to (14.5, 15.0), we'll go around Obstacle 1 from the left side.
3. We'll pass through the gap between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3, keeping a safe distance from both.
4. After passing through this gap, we'll move upwards to get above Obstacle 2.
5. Finally, we'll approach the goal set from above, avoiding all obstacles.

Here's the proposed new path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (1.0, 8.0),    # Move up (unchanged)
    (8.0, 8.0),    # Move right (unchanged)
    (8.0, 15.0),   # Move up (unchanged)
    (12.0, 15.0),  # Move right (unchanged)
    (12.0, 11.0),  # Move down to prepare for gap passage
    (14.0, 11.0),  # Move right through the gap between Obstacle 1 and 3
    (17.0, 11.0),  # Continue moving right to clear the obstacles
    (17.0, 19.0),  # Move up above Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move right into the goal set
]

This new path should avoid all obstacles while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. It maintains a safe distance from all obstacles by utilizing the available spaces between and around them. The path now goes around Obstacle 1 from the left, passes through the gap between Obstacles 1 and 3, and approaches the goal from above Obstacle 2, effectively avoiding the problematic intersections from the previous path.

2. The main issues occur between waypoints (12.0, 15.0) and (19.0, 19.0), where the path intersects multiple obstacles.
3. We need to navigate around Obstacle 4, which extends from y=5.8 to y=13.0 in the lower part.
4. We also need to avoid Obstacles 2 and 3 in the upper part of the path.

Let's adjust the path:

1. From (8.0, 15.0), we'll move slightly to the left to avoid Obstacle 4.
2. We'll go around Obstacle 4 by moving downwards and then to the right.
3. After passing Obstacle 4, we'll move upwards, staying to the left of Obstacles 2 and 3.
4. Finally, we'll navigate to the goal set by moving right and slightly up.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (1.0, 8.0),    # Move up (unchanged)
    (8.0, 8.0),    # Move right (unchanged)
    (8.0, 15.0),   # Move up (unchanged)
    (7.5, 15.0),   # Slight left to avoid Obstacle 4
    (7.5, 5.0),    # Move down to go under Obstacle 4
    (16.5, 5.0),   # Move right, past Obstacle 4
    (16.5, 15.5),  # Move up, staying left of Obstacles 2 and 3
    (17.5, 15.5),  # Slight right to prepare for final approach
    (17.5, 19.0),  # Move up to the level of the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Final move to the goal set
]

This path should:
1. Start in the correct start set
2. Avoid all obstacles by maintaining a safe distance
3. End in the correct goal set

The path now goes under Obstacle 4 instead of trying to go through it. It then moves up between Obstacles 3 and 4, staying to the left of Obstacles 2 and 3 before making the final approach to the goal set. This should resolve all the intersection issues mentioned in the feedback while maintaining a smooth and efficient path.
