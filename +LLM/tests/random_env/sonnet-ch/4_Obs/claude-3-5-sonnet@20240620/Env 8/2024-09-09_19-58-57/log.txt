# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[10.3, 11.2], [15.3, 11.7], [11.7, 14.6], [10.6, 12.6]]
			Obstacle 2: [[19.5, 17.8], [17.1, 17.3], [17.7, 12.0], [18.4, 7.1]]
			Obstacle 3: [[15.0, 16.9], [19.3, 15.5], [19.2, 16.3], [17.9, 17.4]]
			Obstacle 4: [[10.3, 12.2], [6.8, 11.1], [9.4, 1.2], [11.3, 4.1]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]

[09/09/2024 07:59:02 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I've analyzed the environment and devised a path that meets the specified criteria. Here's the path with an explanation:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (5.0, 1.0),    # Move right to avoid Obstacle 4
    (5.0, 15.0),   # Move up, staying clear of Obstacles 4 and 1
    (9.0, 15.0),   # Move right, above Obstacle 1
    (16.0, 15.0),  # Continue right, above Obstacles 1 and 3
    (16.0, 19.0),  # Move up, staying clear of Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set
]

Explanation of the path:
1. The path starts at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start set.
2. It moves right to (5.0, 1.0) to avoid Obstacle 4.
3. Then it goes up to (5.0, 15.0), staying clear of Obstacles 4 and 1.
4. The path continues right to (9.0, 15.0) and then (16.0, 15.0), passing above Obstacles 1 and 3.
5. It then moves up to (16.0, 19.0) to avoid Obstacle 2.
6. Finally, it reaches (19.0, 19.0), which is within the goal set.

This path successfully avoids all obstacles while maintaining a safe distance from them. It starts within the start set and ends within the goal set as required.

[09/09/2024 07:59:11 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Chain of Thought:

1. The start and end points of the original path are correct, so we'll keep them.

2. The main issue is with the segment between (16.0, 15.0) and (16.0, 19.0), which intersects with Obstacle 3.

3. Looking at Obstacle 3's coordinates, we can see it's positioned roughly between x=15 and x=19.3, and y=15.5 and y=17.4.

4. To avoid this obstacle, we need to go around it. We have two options: go to the left of the obstacle or to the right.

5. Going to the left seems more straightforward as it's closer to our previous waypoint (16.0, 15.0).

6. We'll add two new waypoints to navigate around Obstacle 3:
   - One to move left of the obstacle (around x=14.5)
   - Another to move up past the obstacle (around y=17.5)

7. After passing the obstacle, we can move right towards the goal.

8. We should also consider the other obstacles to ensure we're not creating new intersections:
   - Obstacle 1 is in the center, which our path already avoids.
   - Obstacle 2 is on the right side, which our path avoids.
   - Obstacle 4 is in the lower left, which our path avoids.

9. The rest of the path seems fine and doesn't intersect with any obstacles.

Based on this analysis, here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 1.0),     # Move right (unchanged)
    (5.0, 15.0),    # Move up (unchanged)
    (9.0, 15.0),    # Move right (unchanged)
    (16.0, 15.0),   # Move right (unchanged)
    (14.5, 15.0),   # New point: Move left to avoid Obstacle 3
    (14.5, 17.5),   # New point: Move up to pass Obstacle 3
    (16.5, 17.5),   # New point: Move right past Obstacle 3
    (16.5, 19.0),   # Move up towards goal
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End point (unchanged)
]

This new path should avoid all obstacles while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. The additional waypoints allow the path to navigate around Obstacle 3 without intersecting it.
