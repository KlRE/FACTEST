# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.9, 14.3], [15.6, 6.0], [16.0, 3.9], [19.0, 3.3]]
			Obstacle 2: [[14.7, 14.7], [17.1, 11.9], [19.3, 15.9], [15.3, 17.6]]

[09/09/2024 08:00:14 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I've analyzed the environment and devised a path that meets the specified criteria. Here's the path with an explanation:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (5.0, 1.0),    # Move right to avoid Obstacle 1
    (5.0, 5.0),    # Move up, staying clear of Obstacle 1
    (14.0, 5.0),   # Move right, below Obstacles 1 and 4
    (14.0, 18.0),  # Move up, staying left of Obstacles 2 and 4
    (18.5, 18.5)   # Move diagonally to end within the goal set
]

Explanation of the path:

1. The path starts at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start set.
2. It then moves right to (5.0, 1.0) to avoid Obstacle 1.
3. The path goes up to (5.0, 5.0), staying clear of Obstacle 1.
4. It continues right to (14.0, 5.0), passing below Obstacles 1 and 4.
5. The path then moves upward to (14.0, 18.0), staying to the left of Obstacles 2 and 4.
6. Finally, it moves diagonally to (18.5, 18.5), ending within the goal set.

This path successfully avoids all obstacles while maintaining a safe distance from them. It starts within the start set and ends within the goal set as required. The linear segments between these waypoints do not intersect with any of the obstacles.

[09/09/2024 08:00:22 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path are correct and can be maintained.
2. The main issue is with segments 4 and 5, which intersect with Obstacle 3.
3. We need to route the path around Obstacle 3, while also ensuring we don't intersect with other obstacles.
4. There appears to be a clear path between Obstacles 1 and 2, which we can utilize.

Proposed solution:
1. Keep the initial segments (1.0, 1.0) to (14.0, 5.0) as they don't intersect with any obstacles.
2. Instead of going straight up to (14.0, 18.0), we'll route around Obstacle 3:
   a. Move to (14.0, 15.5) to stay below Obstacle 3
   b. Then move right to (16.5, 15.5) to pass between Obstacles 2 and 4
   c. Finally, move up to (16.5, 18.5) to reach the goal area
3. End at (18.5, 18.5) as before, which is within the goal set.

This path should avoid all obstacles while maintaining a safe distance from them.

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 1.0),   # First waypoint (unchanged)
    (5.0, 5.0),   # Second waypoint (unchanged)
    (14.0, 5.0),  # Third waypoint (unchanged)
    (14.0, 15.5), # New waypoint to stay below Obstacle 3
    (16.5, 15.5), # New waypoint to pass between Obstacles 2 and 4
    (16.5, 18.5), # New waypoint to reach the goal area
    (18.5, 18.5)  # End point (unchanged)
]

This new path should satisfy all the requirements:
1. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
2. It avoids all obstacles by maintaining a safe distance.
3. The linear segments between waypoints should not intersect with any obstacles.
4. The path is represented as an array of waypoints that can be linearly connected.

[09/09/2024 08:00:30 PM] Thank you for the feedback. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles.

Analysis:
1. The main issue is with segments 5 and 6, which intersect with Obstacle 2.
2. We need to find a way around Obstacle 2 while still reaching the goal set.
3. Looking at the obstacle layout, there seems to be a passage between Obstacles 1, 2, and 4.
4. We can modify the path to go around Obstacle 2 from the left side.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Keep the initial segments (1-4) as they are valid.
2. Instead of going directly to (16.5, 15.5), we'll go around Obstacle 2.
3. We'll add waypoints to navigate between Obstacles 1, 2, and 4.
4. After passing Obstacle 2, we'll move towards the goal set.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 1.0),    # Waypoint 2 (unchanged)
    (5.0, 5.0),    # Waypoint 3 (unchanged)
    (14.0, 5.0),   # Waypoint 4 (unchanged)
    (14.0, 15.5),  # Waypoint 5 (unchanged)
    (14.5, 16.5),  # New waypoint to start going around Obstacle 2
    (15.0, 17.8),  # New waypoint to pass above Obstacle 2
    (17.5, 17.8),  # New waypoint to clear Obstacle 2
    (18.5, 18.5)   # End point in goal set
]

Explanation of changes:
1. The path now goes around Obstacle 2 from the left side.
2. We added three new waypoints (14.5, 16.5), (15.0, 17.8), and (17.5, 17.8) to navigate around Obstacle 2.
3. The new waypoints ensure we stay clear of Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3.
4. The final segment moves directly to the goal set at (18.5, 18.5).

This new path should avoid all obstacles while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. The added waypoints provide a safer route around Obstacle 2, which was the main problem in the previous path.

[09/09/2024 08:00:39 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles.

Analysis:
The main issue with the previous path was that it intersected with Obstacle 3 while trying to reach the goal set. We need to find a way around this obstacle while still avoiding the other obstacles.

Observations:
1. There's a narrow passage between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 4.
2. We can go around Obstacle 3 by moving to the right of it.
3. We need to be careful not to get too close to Obstacle 1 while moving upwards.

New path strategy:
1. Start from the same point in the start set.
2. Move rightwards and then upwards to avoid Obstacle 1.
3. Navigate through the passage between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 4.
4. Move to the right of Obstacle 3.
5. Finally, approach the goal set from the right side.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (same as before)
    (5.0, 1.0),    # Move right (same as before)
    (5.0, 5.0),    # Move up (same as before)
    (14.0, 5.0),   # Move right (same as before)
    (14.0, 14.0),  # Move up, staying left of Obstacle 4
    (17.5, 14.0),  # Move right, passing between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 4
    (17.5, 17.0),  # Move up, staying right of Obstacle 3
    (19.0, 17.0),  # Move right, approaching the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move up into the goal set
]

Explanation of changes:
1. The first four waypoints remain the same as they were already valid.
2. Instead of going up to 15.5, we now stop at y=14.0 to avoid getting too close to Obstacle 2.
3. We then move right to x=17.5, passing through the gap between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 4.
4. From there, we move up to y=17.0, staying to the right of Obstacle 3.
5. Finally, we approach the goal set from the right side, ending at (19.0, 19.0), which is within the goal set.

This new path should avoid all obstacles while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. It takes advantage of the gaps between obstacles and provides a safe margin around each obstacle to ensure no intersections occur.

[09/09/2024 08:00:49 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path are correct, so we can keep those.
2. The main issue is in the upper-right quadrant of the space, where the path intersects with multiple obstacles.
3. We need to find a way around these obstacles while maintaining a safe distance.

Let's break down the problematic area:
- Obstacle 1 extends from y=3.3 to y=14.3 on the right side of the space.
- Obstacle 2 is in the upper-right corner, roughly from x=14.7 to x=19.3 and y=11.9 to y=17.6.
- Obstacle 3 is in the upper part, from about y=16 to y=19.3.
- Obstacle 4 is below Obstacle 2, from about y=11.1 to y=15.8.

To avoid these obstacles, we can:
1. Keep the path lower until we're past Obstacle 1.
2. Then move upwards between Obstacles 1 and 4.
3. Continue moving up between Obstacles 2 and 3.
4. Finally, approach the goal set from the left.

Based on this analysis, here's a new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 1.0),    # Move right (unchanged)
    (5.0, 5.0),    # Move up (unchanged)
    (14.0, 5.0),   # Move right (unchanged)
    (14.0, 10.0),  # Move up, staying left of Obstacle 1
    (15.0, 10.0),  # Move slightly right, still below Obstacle 4
    (15.0, 15.5),  # Move up between Obstacles 1 and 4
    (16.5, 15.5),  # Move right, above Obstacle 4 and below Obstacle 2
    (16.5, 18.5),  # Move up between Obstacles 2 and 3
    (19.0, 18.5),  # Move right towards the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move slightly up to enter the goal set
]

This new path should:
1. Start in the correct start set.
2. Avoid all obstacles by maintaining a safe distance.
3. End in the correct goal set.
4. Provide a smoother trajectory around the obstacles in the upper-right quadrant.

The path now takes a more circuitous route in the problematic area, ensuring it doesn't intersect with any of the obstacles while still reaching the goal efficiently.

[09/09/2024 08:00:59 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path are correct, so we can keep them.
2. The main issue is with segments 6, 7, and 8, which intersect with Obstacles 2 and 4.
3. We need to find a way around these obstacles while maintaining a safe distance.

Spatial analysis:
1. There's a narrow passage between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 4.
2. There's also a gap between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3.
3. We can utilize these spaces to create a path that avoids all obstacles.

Path adjustment strategy:
1. Keep the initial segments up to point (14.0, 10.0).
2. Instead of going straight up, we'll go around Obstacle 4 from the left side.
3. Then, we'll navigate through the gap between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3.
4. Finally, we'll approach the goal set from the top-left.

New path explanation:
1. (1.0, 1.0) to (14.0, 10.0): Keep these segments as they are correct.
2. (14.0, 10.0) to (14.5, 11.0): Move slightly right and up to prepare for going around Obstacle 4.
3. (14.5, 11.0) to (14.5, 15.0): Move up, staying to the left of Obstacle 4.
4. (14.5, 15.0) to (14.5, 17.8): Continue moving up, now passing to the left of Obstacle 2.
5. (14.5, 17.8) to (16.5, 17.8): Move right, passing above Obstacle 2 and below Obstacle 3.
6. (16.5, 17.8) to (18.5, 19.0): Move diagonally to enter the goal set.

Here's the new path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (5.0, 1.0),
    (5.0, 5.0),
    (14.0, 5.0),
    (14.0, 10.0),
    (14.5, 11.0),
    (14.5, 15.0),
    (14.5, 17.8),
    (16.5, 17.8),
    (18.5, 19.0)
]

This path should avoid all obstacles while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. It maintains a safe distance from all obstacles and uses the available gaps to navigate through the complex environment.
