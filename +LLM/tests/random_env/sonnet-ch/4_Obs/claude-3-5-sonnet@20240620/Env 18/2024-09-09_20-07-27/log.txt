# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[10.9, 17.9], [2.2, 16.6], [3.7, 13.1], [7.2, 10.6]]
			Obstacle 2: [[17.0, 18.9], [15.2, 16.3], [17.9, 13.0], [19.3, 13.4]]
			Obstacle 3: [[16.9, 19.2], [15.3, 8.0], [16.3, 11.5], [17.5, 16.2]]
			Obstacle 4: [[0.4, 17.7], [5.3, 17.2], [9.0, 18.7], [1.0, 17.9]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]

[09/09/2024 08:07:34 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll create a path that avoids the obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. Let's analyze the environment:

1. The start area is in the bottom-left corner (0,0 to 2,2).
2. The goal area is in the top-right corner (18,18 to 20,20).
3. There are four obstacles to avoid:
   - Obstacle 1 is in the middle-left area
   - Obstacle 2 is near the top-right corner
   - Obstacle 3 is a vertical obstacle on the right side
   - Obstacle 4 is along the top edge

To create a safe path, we'll start from the start area, move towards the right side while staying below the obstacles, then move upwards through the gap between Obstacles 1 and 3, and finally approach the goal area from the right side.

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point within the start area
    (5.0, 1.0),    # Move right, staying below obstacles
    (11.0, 1.0),   # Continue moving right
    (16.0, 1.0),   # Reach the right side of the environment
    (16.0, 7.0),   # Move upwards, staying to the right of Obstacle 1
    (16.0, 14.0),  # Continue moving upwards, passing between Obstacles 1 and 3
    (18.5, 14.0),  # Move slightly right, preparing to approach the goal
    (18.5, 17.5),  # Move upwards, staying to the right of Obstacle 3
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point within the goal area
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set
2. Ends within the goal set
3. Avoids all obstacles with a safe margin
4. Uses linear segments between waypoints
5. Does not cross any obstacles

The path takes a conservative approach by maintaining a good distance from all obstacles, ensuring safety and compliance with the non-crossing requirement.

[09/09/2024 08:07:43 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path are correct, so we can keep them.
2. The main issues occur around obstacles 2 and 3 in the upper right quadrant of the space.
3. We need to find a way to navigate around these obstacles while maintaining a safe distance.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Start from (1.0, 1.0) as before.
2. We can keep the initial segments up to (16.0, 1.0) as they don't intersect with any obstacles.
3. Instead of going straight up to (16.0, 14.0), we'll take a more gradual approach to avoid obstacle 3.
4. We'll move diagonally up and right to (17.0, 7.0), which should clear obstacle 3.
5. From there, we'll move up to (17.0, 12.0), which should be above obstacle 2 and to the right of obstacle 3.
6. Next, we'll move right to (19.5, 12.0) to clear all obstacles.
7. Finally, we'll move up to (19.0, 19.0) to reach the goal set.

Based on this analysis, here's the proposed new path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start point
    (5.0, 1.0),   # Intermediate point
    (11.0, 1.0),  # Intermediate point
    (16.0, 1.0),  # Intermediate point
    (17.0, 7.0),  # Diagonal move to avoid obstacle 3
    (17.0, 12.0), # Move up, staying clear of obstacles 2 and 3
    (19.5, 12.0), # Move right, clearing all obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End point in goal set
]

This path should avoid all obstacles while maintaining a safe distance from them. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set as required. The path takes a more circuitous route around the upper right quadrant to navigate the complex arrangement of obstacles in that area.
