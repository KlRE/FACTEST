# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[7.2, 18.1], [7.7, 15.8], [14.3, 10.2], [14.0, 16.7]]
			Obstacle 2: [[19.5, 5.7], [15.3, 9.0], [16.1, 6.6], [18.2, 5.7]]
			Obstacle 3: [[6.1, 17.9], [12.6, 15.3], [17.6, 15.7], [12.2, 16.9]]
			Obstacle 4: [[10.4, 2.8], [18.4, 4.4], [15.4, 9.7], [10.5, 14.2]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

[09/09/2024 07:55:53 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and propose a path that avoids obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set.

Analysis:
1. The start area is in the bottom-left corner (0,0 to 2,2).
2. The goal area is in the top-right corner (18,18 to 20,20).
3. There are four obstacles scattered across the space.
4. The main challenge is navigating around Obstacles 1 and 3, which form a barrier in the upper-left area.
5. There's a passage between Obstacles 1 and 4 that can be utilized.
6. After passing this area, the path can curve towards the goal, avoiding Obstacle 2.

Proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start within the start set
    (5.0, 5.0),     # Move diagonally to approach the passage
    (9.0, 12.0),    # Navigate through the passage between Obstacles 1 and 4
    (13.0, 15.0),   # Continue moving upward and right, avoiding Obstacle 3
    (17.0, 17.0),   # Approach the goal area
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End within the goal set
]

Rationale:
1. The path starts at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start set.
2. It moves diagonally to (5.0, 5.0) to approach the passage between obstacles.
3. The waypoint (9.0, 12.0) helps navigate through the passage between Obstacles 1 and 4.
4. Moving to (13.0, 15.0) keeps the path clear of Obstacle 3.
5. The point (17.0, 17.0) approaches the goal area while staying clear of Obstacle 2.
6. Finally, it ends at (19.0, 19.0), which is within the goal set.

This path should satisfy all the requirements: it starts and ends in the correct areas, avoids all obstacles with a safe margin, and provides a smooth trajectory from start to goal.

[09/09/2024 07:56:09 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issues are with segments 3 and 4, which intersect with multiple obstacles.
3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3, which are blocking the direct path.
4. There seems to be a narrow passage between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3 that we can utilize.
5. We should also stay clear of Obstacle 4, which extends from the bottom-left towards the center.

Proposed changes:
1. Keep the first two waypoints (1.0, 1.0) and (5.0, 5.0).
2. Instead of going directly to (9.0, 12.0), we'll add an intermediate point to go around Obstacle 4.
3. We'll then navigate through the gap between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3.
4. Finally, we'll adjust the last few points to reach the goal while avoiding Obstacle 3.

Here's the new proposed path with explanations:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 5.0),  # Second point (unchanged)
    (7.0, 10.0),  # New point to avoid Obstacle 4
    (8.0, 14.0),  # Navigate towards the gap between Obstacle 1 and 3
    (11.0, 17.0),  # Pass through the gap
    (15.0, 18.0),  # Move towards the goal while staying above Obstacle 3
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point in the goal set (unchanged)
]

This new path should avoid all obstacles:
1. It starts by moving northeast, staying clear of Obstacle 4.
2. It then moves more directly north to approach the gap between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3.
3. The path passes through this gap, maintaining a safe distance from both obstacles.
4. Finally, it moves towards the goal area while staying above Obstacle 3.

This path should satisfy all the requirements: it starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, avoids all obstacles, and provides a smooth trajectory without sharp turns.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.

3. We need to find a way around these obstacles while maintaining a safe distance.

Spatial analysis:
1. There's a narrow passage between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3, but it's too risky to navigate through.
2. The safest route appears to be going around Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3 from the left side.
3. We need to be careful not to get too close to Obstacle 4 while doing this.

Path planning:
1. We'll keep the first three waypoints as they don't intersect with any obstacles.
2. Instead of going directly to (8.0, 14.0), we'll add a waypoint to start moving left around Obstacle 1.
3. We'll add more waypoints to navigate around Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3 safely.
4. After clearing these obstacles, we can move towards the goal set.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 5.0),    # Unchanged
    (7.0, 10.0),   # Unchanged
    (6.0, 13.0),   # New point to start moving left around Obstacle 1
    (5.0, 16.0),   # Moving further left and up
    (5.5, 18.5),   # Going above Obstacle 3
    (10.0, 19.0),  # Moving right above Obstacle 3
    (15.0, 19.5),  # Continuing right
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point (unchanged)
]

Explanation of changes:
1. The new waypoint (6.0, 13.0) helps us start moving left to avoid Obstacle 1.
2. (5.0, 16.0) continues this leftward movement while also moving upward.
3. (5.5, 18.5) takes us above Obstacle 3, giving it a wide berth.
4. (10.0, 19.0) and (15.0, 19.5) allow us to move rightward above both Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3.
5. The final segment to (19.0, 19.0) brings us into the goal set.

This path should avoid all obstacles while maintaining a safe distance from them. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set as required.
