# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[2.8, 16.7], [4.1, 16.0], [6.4, 19.2], [4.7, 18.5]]
			Obstacle 2: [[15.8, 1.7], [18.0, 6.5], [17.7, 13.5], [16.7, 11.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[5.2, 12.4], [11.0, 4.9], [17.0, 1.6], [13.7, 7.0]]
			Obstacle 4: [[3.1, 1.3], [12.6, 3.3], [12.1, 4.9], [7.0, 7.2]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

[09/09/2024 07:53:04 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and propose a path that satisfies the conditions.

Analysis:
1. The start area is a 2x2 square in the bottom-left corner.
2. The goal area is a 2x2 square in the top-right corner.
3. There are four obstacles scattered across the space.
4. We need to find a path that avoids these obstacles while moving from start to goal.

Path planning:
1. We'll start from the top-right corner of the start area to get a head start towards the goal.
2. We need to avoid Obstacle 4 which is near the start area.
3. There's a clear path between Obstacles 3 and 4.
4. We'll then need to navigate between Obstacles 1 and 2.
5. Finally, we'll approach the goal area from the bottom-left.

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Start at the top-right corner of the start area
    (2.5, 8.0),    # Move up to avoid Obstacle 4
    (13.0, 8.0),   # Move right, passing between Obstacles 3 and 4
    (13.0, 17.0),  # Move up, avoiding Obstacle 2
    (7.0, 17.0),   # Move left, avoiding Obstacle 1
    (7.0, 20.0),   # Move up to the level of the goal
    (18.5, 20.0),  # Move right towards the goal
    (18.5, 18.5)   # Move down slightly to end within the goal area
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set
2. Ends within the goal set
3. Avoids all obstacles with a safe margin
4. Uses straight line segments between waypoints
5. Does not cross any obstacles

The path takes a somewhat roundabout route to ensure clear avoidance of all obstacles while maintaining simplicity with straight-line segments.

[09/09/2024 07:53:12 PM] Thank you for the feedback. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids intersecting with the obstacles.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issue is the segment between (2.5, 8.0) and (13.0, 8.0) intersecting with Obstacle 3.
3. Obstacle 3 is a large diagonal obstacle that we need to navigate around.
4. We should aim to go either above or below Obstacle 3.
5. Going above seems more straightforward as it aligns better with our end goal.

Let's adjust the path:

1. Keep the start point at (2.0, 2.0).
2. Instead of going straight to (2.5, 8.0), let's move up and slightly right to (3.0, 13.0) to avoid Obstacle 4 and prepare to go above Obstacle 3.
3. From there, we'll move to (7.0, 15.0) to clear the top of Obstacle 3.
4. Then we can move right to (14.0, 15.0) to get past Obstacle 3.
5. Now we need to navigate between Obstacles 1 and 2. We can do this by moving to (15.0, 17.0).
6. From here, we can safely move towards our goal. Let's go to (18.0, 19.0).
7. Finally, we'll end at (19.0, 19.0) which is within the goal set.

This path should avoid all obstacles while maintaining a safe distance from them.

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),
    (3.0, 13.0),
    (7.0, 15.0),
    (14.0, 15.0),
    (15.0, 17.0),
    (18.0, 19.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]

This new path takes a wider berth around Obstacle 3, avoids the intersection we had before, and safely navigates between the other obstacles to reach the goal set.
