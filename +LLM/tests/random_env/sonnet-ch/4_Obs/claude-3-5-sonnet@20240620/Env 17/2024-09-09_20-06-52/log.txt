# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[18.9, 12.3], [6.5, 2.5], [7.1, 2.0], [14.7, 3.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[12.7, 10.4], [19.9, 11.6], [15.7, 18.3], [14.6, 18.9]]
			Obstacle 3: [[17.8, 13.7], [13.8, 9.5], [14.3, 6.6], [18.0, 1.6]]
			Obstacle 4: [[11.1, 5.3], [19.1, 9.0], [14.1, 13.9], [12.4, 14.8]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]

[09/09/2024 08:07:03 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I've analyzed the environment and devised a path that avoids all obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. Here's the path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point within the start set
    (3.0, 1.0),    # Move right to avoid Obstacle 1
    (5.0, 4.0),    # Move diagonally up and right, avoiding Obstacles 1, 3, and 4
    (10.0, 8.0),   # Continue moving diagonally, staying clear of Obstacles 2 and 4
    (16.0, 14.0),  # Move further up and right, avoiding Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point within the goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set at (1.0, 1.0).
2. Moves right to avoid Obstacle 1.
3. Takes a diagonal path to navigate between Obstacles 1, 3, and 4.
4. Continues diagonally to stay clear of Obstacles 2 and 4.
5. Makes a final move to reach the goal set, ending at (19.0, 19.0).

The path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles and doesn't cross any of them. It uses straight line segments between waypoints for simplicity and meets all the specified requirements.

[09/09/2024 08:07:12 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issue is with segments 4 and 5, which intersect with Obstacles 2 and 4.
3. We need to find a way around these obstacles while maintaining a safe distance.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Keep the first three waypoints as they don't intersect with any obstacles.
2. Instead of going directly from (10.0, 8.0) to (16.0, 14.0), we'll add intermediate points to navigate around Obstacles 2 and 4.
3. We can go around the left side of Obstacle 4, then between Obstacles 2 and 3.
4. Finally, we'll approach the goal set from the left to avoid Obstacle 2.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (3.0, 1.0),    # Second point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 4.0),    # Third point (unchanged)
    (10.0, 8.0),   # Fourth point (unchanged)
    (11.0, 9.0),   # New point to start avoiding Obstacle 4
    (10.5, 11.0),  # New point to go around the left side of Obstacle 4
    (12.0, 13.0),  # New point to pass between Obstacles 2 and 3
    (14.0, 15.5),  # New point to continue upwards
    (16.0, 17.0),  # New point to approach the goal set from the left
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point (unchanged)
]

This new path should:
1. Start in the correct start set
2. End in the correct goal set
3. Avoid all obstacles by maintaining a safe distance
4. Provide a smoother and safer trajectory around the problematic areas

The additional waypoints allow the path to navigate the complex obstacle arrangement more effectively, especially in the crowded area between waypoints 4 and 5 of the original path.

[09/09/2024 08:07:26 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path are correct, so we can keep them.
2. The main issue is with segments 7, 8, and 9, which intersect with Obstacles 2 and 4.
3. We need to find a way around these obstacles while maintaining a safe distance.
4. Looking at the obstacle layout, there seems to be a path between Obstacles 1 and 4, then curving around Obstacle 2 to reach the goal.

Proposed changes:
1. Keep the first 6 waypoints as they don't intersect with any obstacles.
2. From point (10.5, 11.0), we'll add waypoints to navigate between Obstacles 1 and 4.
3. Then, we'll curve around Obstacle 2 to reach the goal area.

Here's the new proposed path with explanation:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (3.0, 1.0),    # (unchanged)
    (5.0, 4.0),    # (unchanged)
    (10.0, 8.0),   # (unchanged)
    (11.0, 9.0),   # (unchanged)
    (10.5, 11.0),  # (unchanged)
    (9.0, 12.5),   # Move left to avoid Obstacle 4
    (8.0, 14.0),   # Continue moving up and left between Obstacles 1 and 4
    (9.0, 16.0),   # Start curving right to go around Obstacle 2
    (11.0, 17.5),  # Continue curving
    (13.0, 18.5),  # Move further right while staying above Obstacle 2
    (15.0, 19.0),  # Approach the goal area
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point in the goal area (unchanged)
]

This new path should avoid all obstacles while maintaining a safe distance. It navigates between Obstacles 1 and 4, then curves around Obstacle 2 to reach the goal area. The path starts in the start set and ends in the goal set as required.
