# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[14.1, 18.1], [8.2, 19.5], [9.4, 15.6], [13.5, 16.9]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

[09/09/2024 07:31:35 PM] HTTP Request: POST https://europe-west1-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/gentle-keyword-432706-b3/locations/europe-west1/publishers/anthropic/models/claude-3-5-sonnet@20240620:rawPredict "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[09/09/2024 07:31:35 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I've analyzed the environment and devised a path that meets the criteria. Here's my analysis and proposed path:

The start position is a square from (0,0) to (2,2), and the goal position is a square from (18,18) to (20,20). There's one obstacle between them, positioned roughly diagonally across the middle of the space.

To create a safe path, we'll start from the center of the start square, move upwards to clear the obstacle, then move diagonally towards the goal, and finally approach the goal from above.

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start at the center of the start square
    (1.0, 10.0),  # Move upwards to clear the obstacle
    (7.0, 16.0),  # Move diagonally towards the goal, staying clear of the obstacle
    (14.0, 20.0),  # Continue moving diagonally, now above the obstacle
    (19.0, 20.0),  # Move horizontally to approach the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move down to the center of the goal square
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set
2. Ends within the goal set
3. Avoids the obstacle by a safe margin
4. Uses straight line segments between waypoints
5. Does not cross or touch the obstacle

The path takes a conservative approach, giving the obstacle a wide berth to ensure safety. It first moves vertically to gain height, then moves diagonally across the space above the obstacle, and finally approaches the goal from above to ensure a clear path.

[09/09/2024 07:32:04 PM] Thank you for the feedback. I'll analyze the situation and provide a corrected path that avoids intersecting with the obstacle.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path are correct.
2. The problematic segment is between (7.0, 16.0) and (14.0, 20.0), which intersects with Obstacle 1.
3. We need to modify this segment to go around the obstacle while maintaining a safe distance.

Thought process for correction:
1. We'll keep the first two waypoints as they are safe: (1.0, 1.0) and (1.0, 10.0).
2. From (1.0, 10.0), we'll adjust the path to go around the left side of Obstacle 1.
3. We'll add a waypoint to the left of the obstacle's leftmost point (8.2, 19.5).
4. Then, we'll add another waypoint above the obstacle to ensure we clear it completely.
5. Finally, we'll connect to a point near the original (14.0, 20.0), but slightly adjusted to maintain distance from the obstacle.
6. The last two points of the original path can be kept as they are safe.

New path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (1.0, 10.0),   # Second point (unchanged)
    (7.0, 16.0),   # Third point (unchanged)
    (7.5, 20.0),   # New point to go around the left side of the obstacle
    (11.0, 21.0),  # New point above the obstacle
    (15.0, 21.0),  # Adjusted point to replace (14.0, 20.0), now above the obstacle
    (19.0, 20.0),  # Original point (unchanged)
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point (unchanged)
]

This new path should successfully avoid intersecting with Obstacle 1 while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. The added waypoints ensure that the path goes around the left side of the obstacle and maintains a safe distance from it.
