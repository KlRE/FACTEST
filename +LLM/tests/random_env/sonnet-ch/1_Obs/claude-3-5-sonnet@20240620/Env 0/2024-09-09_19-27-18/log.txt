# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[16.5, 17.7], [13.3, 16.2], [16.5, 8.4], [17.1, 8.6]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/09/2024 07:27:25 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and propose a path that meets the criteria.

Analysis:
1. The start set is a 2x2 square in the bottom-left corner of the space.
2. The goal set is a 2x2 square in the top-right corner of the space.
3. There is one obstacle, a quadrilateral, positioned between the start and goal sets.
4. The obstacle is angled, creating a narrower passage on its right side compared to its left side.
5. There's more open space to the left of the obstacle, which could provide a safer route.

Path Planning:
1. Start from a point within the start set, preferably closer to the left side to avoid the obstacle.
2. Move diagonally up and left to give a wide berth to the obstacle.
3. Continue moving upwards, staying to the left of the obstacle.
4. Once past the obstacle, move diagonally up and right towards the goal set.
5. End at a point within the goal set.

Based on this analysis, here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),      # Start point within the start set
    (0.0, 5.0),      # Move up and left to avoid the obstacle
    (5.0, 12.0),     # Continue moving up, staying left of the obstacle
    (12.0, 17.0),    # Move diagonally towards the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)     # End point within the goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set
2. Ends within the goal set
3. Avoids the obstacle by maintaining a safe distance
4. Uses linear segments between waypoints
5. Does not cross or touch the obstacle

The path takes a wider route to the left of the obstacle, which provides more clearance and reduces the risk of accidentally intersecting with the obstacle. The final approach to the goal set is made from a safer angle, avoiding the narrower passage on the right side of the obstacle.
