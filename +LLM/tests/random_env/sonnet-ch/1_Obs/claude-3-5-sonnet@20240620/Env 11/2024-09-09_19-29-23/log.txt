# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]

[09/09/2024 07:29:29 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and propose a path that meets the criteria.

Analysis:
1. The start area is a 2x2 square at the bottom-left of the space.
2. The goal area is a 2x2 square at the top-right of the space.
3. There's one obstacle between the start and goal, positioned diagonally.
4. We need to avoid this obstacle while moving from the start to the goal.

Path planning:
1. We'll start from the top-right corner of the start area to maximize initial distance from the obstacle.
2. We'll move diagonally up and right, staying below the obstacle.
3. Once we're past the obstacle, we'll move directly to the goal area.
4. We'll end at the bottom-left corner of the goal area.

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Start at top-right corner of start area
    (10.0, 8.0),   # Move diagonally up and right, staying below the obstacle
    (18.0, 16.0),  # Continue moving diagonally, now past the obstacle
    (18.0, 18.0)   # End at bottom-left corner of goal area
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set
2. Ends within the goal set
3. Avoids the obstacle by maintaining a safe distance
4. Provides a smooth, efficient route from start to goal

The path consists of straight line segments between waypoints, ensuring it doesn't cross the obstacle and maintains a safe distance throughout its trajectory.

[09/09/2024 07:29:36 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacle while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct, so we can keep those.
2. The problem occurs with the second segment, from (10.0, 8.0) to (18.0, 16.0), which intersects with Obstacle 1.
3. Obstacle 1 is roughly located in the upper-right quadrant of our path space, with its lowest point at (14.0, 11.0) and its highest point at (16.9, 18.4).
4. To avoid this obstacle, we need to either go around it from below or from the left side.

Proposed solution:
1. Keep the start point at (2.0, 2.0).
2. Maintain the second point at (10.0, 8.0) as it's safely away from the obstacle.
3. Instead of going directly to (18.0, 16.0), we'll add two new waypoints to go around the obstacle from below:
   a. First, move to a point below the obstacle, like (14.0, 9.0).
   b. Then, move to a point to the right of the obstacle, like (19.0, 14.0).
4. Finally, we can safely reach the goal at (18.0, 18.0).

This path should maintain a safe distance from the obstacle while still efficiently reaching the goal.

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (10.0, 8.0),   # Second point (unchanged)
    (14.0, 9.0),   # New point to go below the obstacle
    (19.0, 14.0),  # New point to go to the right of the obstacle
    (18.0, 18.0)   # End point in the goal set (unchanged)
]

This new path should avoid intersecting with Obstacle 1 while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. The additional waypoints allow the path to navigate around the obstacle safely.

[09/09/2024 07:29:47 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacle while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The problematic segment is between (14.0, 9.0) and (19.0, 14.0), which intersects with Obstacle 1.
3. Obstacle 1 is roughly positioned diagonally from bottom-left to top-right in the path of our original route.
4. To avoid this obstacle, we need to either go above it or below it.
5. Going below the obstacle seems more straightforward and requires less deviation from the original path.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Keep the first three waypoints as they are valid: (2.0, 2.0), (10.0, 8.0), (14.0, 9.0)
2. From (14.0, 9.0), we need to go around the bottom of the obstacle.
3. We'll add a new waypoint at (16.0, 9.5) to start moving around the obstacle.
4. Then, we'll add another waypoint at (18.0, 11.0) to clear the bottom-right corner of the obstacle.
5. From there, we can safely move to a point near our original final waypoint.
6. Finally, we'll end at the same point in the goal set: (18.0, 18.0)

Based on this analysis, here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),
    (10.0, 8.0),
    (14.0, 9.0),
    (16.0, 9.5),
    (18.0, 11.0),
    (19.0, 15.0),
    (18.0, 18.0)
]

This new path should:
1. Start in the correct start set
2. Avoid intersecting with Obstacle 1 by going underneath it
3. End in the correct goal set
4. Provide a smooth and efficient route from start to goal

The additional waypoints allow the path to curve around the bottom of the obstacle while maintaining a safe distance. The final approach to the goal set is adjusted to come from a lower angle, ensuring we don't intersect with the obstacle on the way to the final point.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [

[09/09/2024 07:30:12 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issue is with segments 4 and 5, which intersect with Obstacle 1.
3. Obstacle 1 is positioned diagonally from approximately (14, 11) to (18.7, 13.5), blocking a direct path to the goal.
4. We need to route the path around this obstacle, preferably below it since that's closer to our previous trajectory.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Keep the first three waypoints as they are valid and provide a good approach.
2. Instead of going directly towards the goal from (16.0, 9.5), we'll add a waypoint to go further right before turning upwards.
3. We'll then add waypoints to navigate around the bottom-right corner of the obstacle.
4. Finally, we'll add a waypoint to approach the goal set from a safe angle.

Here's the proposed new path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (10.0, 8.0),   # Second point (unchanged)
    (14.0, 9.0),   # Third point (unchanged)
    (16.0, 9.5),   # Fourth point (unchanged)
    (18.0, 9.5),   # New point: Move further right before turning
    (18.5, 10.0),  # New point: Start moving upward, staying clear of the obstacle
    (19.0, 13.0),  # New point: Continue upward, clearing the bottom-right corner of the obstacle
    (19.0, 16.0),  # New point: Move further up to safely clear the obstacle
    (18.5, 17.5),  # New point: Approach the goal set
    (18.0, 18.0)   # End point (unchanged)
]

This new path should avoid intersecting with Obstacle 1 by going around its bottom-right corner. The path maintains a safe distance from the obstacle while still efficiently moving towards the goal. The additional waypoints allow for a smoother navigation around the obstacle, ensuring that no linear segment between waypoints intersects with the obstacle.

The path still starts in the start set and ends in the goal set, meeting those requirements. By adding more waypoints and carefully plotting the route around the obstacle, we've addressed the intersection issues identified in the feedback while maintaining an efficient path to the goal.
