# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.5, 7.9], [8.3, 1.4], [10.9, 8.2], [6.8, 13.7]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/09/2024 07:29:16 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and propose a path that meets the criteria.

Analyzing the environment:
1. The start position is a square from (0,0) to (2,2).
2. The goal position is a square from (18,18) to (20,20).
3. There's one obstacle between the start and goal positions.
4. The obstacle is a quadrilateral that doesn't fully block the path from start to goal.
5. There's enough space to navigate around the obstacle on either side.

Considering these factors, I'll plan a path that starts within the start set, avoids the obstacle with a safe margin, and ends within the goal set.

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start point within the start set
    (3.0, 3.0),     # Move diagonally to approach the obstacle
    (2.0, 9.0),     # Navigate around the left side of the obstacle
    (5.0, 14.0),    # Continue moving up and slightly right
    (12.0, 16.0),   # Move towards the goal area
    (16.0, 18.0),   # Approach the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End point within the goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set at (1.0, 1.0).
2. Moves diagonally to approach the obstacle.
3. Navigates around the left side of the obstacle, maintaining a safe distance.
4. Continues moving upward and to the right, avoiding any potential intersection with the obstacle.
5. Approaches the goal area from the bottom left.
6. Ends within the goal set at (19.0, 19.0).

The path avoids crossing or touching the obstacle by maintaining a sufficient distance from its edges. The linear segments between waypoints do not intersect with the obstacle. The path fulfills all the requirements by starting in the start set, ending in the goal set, and avoiding the obstacle.
