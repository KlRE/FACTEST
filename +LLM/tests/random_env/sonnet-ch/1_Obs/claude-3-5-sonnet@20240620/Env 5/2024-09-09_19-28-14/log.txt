# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[13.9, 19.6], [15.8, 13.9], [16.4, 14.6], [15.5, 19.4]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]

[09/09/2024 07:28:20 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and propose a path that meets the criteria.

Analysis:
1. The start position is a square from (0,0) to (2,2).
2. The goal position is a square from (18,18) to (20,20).
3. There's one obstacle between the start and goal, positioned diagonally.
4. The obstacle doesn't block the entire path, leaving space to navigate around it.

Path Planning:
1. We'll start from a point within the start square.
2. We'll move diagonally towards the goal, staying clear of the obstacle.
3. We'll adjust our path to avoid the obstacle by moving above it.
4. Finally, we'll approach the goal square from above.

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start point within the start square
    (7.0, 7.0),  # Move diagonally towards the goal
    (12.0, 12.0),  # Continue diagonal movement
    (14.0, 15.0),  # Adjust path to avoid the obstacle
    (16.0, 17.0),  # Move towards the goal while staying clear of the obstacle
    (18.0, 18.5),  # Approach the goal square
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point within the goal square
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set (1.0, 1.0).
2. Ends within the goal set (19.0, 19.0).
3. Avoids the obstacle by passing above it.
4. Uses linear segments between waypoints.
5. Maintains a safe distance from the obstacle to ensure no crossing or touching occurs.

The path takes a slightly curved approach to avoid the obstacle while maintaining a generally direct route from start to goal. This solution provides a balance between efficiency and safety, ensuring all requirements are met.

[09/09/2024 07:28:30 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacle while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path are correct, so we can keep them.
2. The problematic segment is between (14.0, 15.0) and (16.0, 17.0), which intersects with Obstacle 1.
3. Obstacle 1 is roughly positioned diagonally from bottom-left to top-right in the area we're trying to traverse.
4. We need to find a way around this obstacle while maintaining a safe distance.

Proposed solution:
1. Keep the first four waypoints as they are correct and don't intersect with the obstacle.
2. Instead of going directly from (14.0, 15.0) to (16.0, 17.0), we'll add intermediate points to go around the obstacle.
3. We'll first move more to the left to avoid the lower part of the obstacle, then go up, and finally move right to get back on track towards the goal.
4. After passing the obstacle, we'll adjust our path to reach the goal set.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (7.0, 7.0),    # Intermediate point (unchanged)
    (12.0, 12.0),  # Intermediate point (unchanged)
    (14.0, 15.0),  # Last point before obstacle avoidance (unchanged)
    (13.5, 16.5),  # New point: Move left and up to avoid lower part of obstacle
    (14.5, 18.0),  # New point: Continue moving up to clear the obstacle
    (16.5, 18.5),  # New point: Move right after clearing the obstacle
    (18.0, 19.0),  # New point: Adjust towards the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point in goal set (unchanged)
]

Explanation of changes:
1. The new waypoint (13.5, 16.5) helps us move left and up, avoiding the lower part of the obstacle.
2. The next waypoint (14.5, 18.0) continues the upward movement, ensuring we clear the top of the obstacle.
3. After clearing the obstacle, we move right with the waypoint (16.5, 18.5) to get back on track towards the goal.
4. We add an additional waypoint (18.0, 19.0) to smooth the approach to the goal set.
5. The final waypoint remains in the goal set.

This new path should avoid intersecting with Obstacle 1 while maintaining a safe distance from it. The path still starts in the start set and ends in the goal set, meeting all the requirements.

[09/09/2024 07:28:38 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct.
2. The main issue is with segments 5 and 6, which intersect with Obstacle 1.
3. Obstacle 1 is positioned diagonally from approximately (13.9, 19.6) to (16.4, 14.6).
4. We need to adjust the path to go around this obstacle, preferably to the left side as it's closer to our previous trajectory.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Keep the first four waypoints as they are valid and don't intersect with any obstacles.
2. Instead of going through the obstacle, we'll go around its left side.
3. We'll add a new point to the left of the obstacle's top-left corner.
4. Then, we'll add another point above the obstacle's top-right corner.
5. From there, we can safely proceed to the goal area.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (7.0, 7.0),    # Intermediate point (unchanged)
    (12.0, 12.0),  # Intermediate point (unchanged)
    (14.0, 15.0),  # Intermediate point (unchanged)
    (13.0, 17.0),  # New point to avoid obstacle (left of top-left corner)
    (13.5, 20.0),  # New point above the obstacle
    (16.5, 20.0),  # New point still above the obstacle
    (18.0, 19.0),  # Moving towards goal area
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point in goal area (unchanged)
]

Explanation of changes:
1. The path now goes to (13.0, 17.0), which is to the left of the obstacle's top-left corner (13.9, 19.6).
2. It then moves up to (13.5, 20.0), which is above the obstacle's top edge.
3. The path continues to (16.5, 20.0), still above the obstacle.
4. From there, it can safely descend to the goal area.

This new path should avoid intersecting with the obstacle while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. The additional waypoints ensure a clear path around the obstacle, maintaining a safe distance to avoid any potential intersections.
