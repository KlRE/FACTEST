# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[11.5, 17.4], [6.2, 14.3], [8.8, 11.8], [15.3, 10.6]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]

[09/09/2024 07:27:52 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and propose a path that meets the criteria.

Analysis:
1. The start position is a 2x2 square in the bottom-left corner.
2. The goal position is a 2x2 square in the top-right corner.
3. There's one obstacle in the middle of the space, slightly towards the upper-left.
4. We need to find a path that avoids this obstacle while moving from start to goal.

Path Planning:
1. We'll start from a point within the start set, preferably towards the right side to begin moving towards the goal.
2. We'll then move diagonally up and right, staying below and to the right of the obstacle.
3. Once we've cleared the obstacle, we'll move more directly towards the goal.
4. Finally, we'll end at a point within the goal set.

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.5, 1.0),    # Start point within the start set
    (6.0, 5.0),    # Move diagonally, staying below the obstacle
    (15.0, 11.0),  # Continue moving up and right, now past the obstacle
    (18.0, 15.0),  # Approach the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point within the goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set
2. Ends within the goal set
3. Avoids the obstacle by maintaining a safe distance
4. Consists of straight line segments between waypoints
5. Does not cross or touch the obstacle

The path takes a wide berth around the obstacle to ensure it doesn't come too close or risk intersecting it. The diagonal movement helps to efficiently cover ground while maintaining distance from the obstacle. The final approach to the goal is more direct once the obstacle has been cleared.

[09/09/2024 07:27:59 PM] Thank you for the feedback and example. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacle while meeting all requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct, so we can keep those.
2. The main issue is that the path intersects with Obstacle 1, specifically in segments 2 and 3.
3. Obstacle 1 is positioned in the upper-right quadrant of the space, roughly between (6.2, 14.3) and (15.3, 10.6).
4. To avoid this obstacle, we need to either go around it from below or from the left side.
5. Going below seems more direct and efficient given the start and end positions.

Proposed solution:
1. Keep the first two waypoints as they are valid and don't intersect with the obstacle.
2. Add a new waypoint to go below the obstacle before moving upwards towards the goal.
3. Adjust the final approach to the goal to ensure we don't intersect with the obstacle.

Here's the thought process for the new path:
1. Start at (1.5, 1.0) within the start set.
2. Move to (6.0, 5.0) as before, which is below the obstacle.
3. Add a new point at (10.0, 8.0) to pass below the obstacle.
4. Move to (16.0, 13.0) to get past the obstacle on the right side.
5. Finally, approach the goal at (19.0, 19.0).

New path:

new_path = [
    (1.5, 1.0),
    (6.0, 5.0),
    (10.0, 8.0),
    (16.0, 13.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]

This path should avoid intersecting with Obstacle 1 by passing below it, while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. The added waypoints allow for a smoother navigation around the obstacle without crossing it.

[09/09/2024 07:28:07 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacle while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path are correct, so we can keep them.
2. The problematic segment is between (10.0, 8.0) and (16.0, 13.0), which intersects with Obstacle 1.
3. Obstacle 1 is roughly diamond-shaped and positioned in the upper-right quadrant of the space.
4. To avoid this obstacle, we need to either go above it or below it.

Proposed solution:
1. Keep the first three waypoints as they are valid and don't intersect with the obstacle.
2. Add two new waypoints to go around the bottom of the obstacle.
3. Adjust the final waypoint to ensure a smooth approach to the goal.

Explanation of changes:
1. From (10.0, 8.0), we'll add a point that moves slightly right and down to avoid the bottom-left corner of the obstacle.
2. Then, we'll add another point that moves right and slightly up, passing below the obstacle.
3. From there, we can safely move to a point near the original (16.0, 13.0) without intersecting the obstacle.
4. Finally, we'll adjust the last point to approach the goal from a slightly different angle.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.5, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (6.0, 5.0),    # Second point (unchanged)
    (10.0, 8.0),   # Third point (unchanged)
    (11.0, 7.0),   # New point to move below the obstacle
    (14.0, 8.0),   # New point to pass under the obstacle
    (16.0, 11.0),  # Adjusted point to safely clear the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point (unchanged)
]

This new path should avoid intersecting with Obstacle 1 while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. The added waypoints allow the path to smoothly navigate around the bottom of the obstacle, maintaining a safe distance from its edges.
