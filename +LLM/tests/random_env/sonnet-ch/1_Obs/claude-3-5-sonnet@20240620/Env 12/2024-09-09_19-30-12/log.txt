# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.6, 18.8], [6.3, 17.5], [13.9, 16.8], [19.0, 16.6]]

## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]

[09/09/2024 07:30:19 PM] HTTP Request: POST https://europe-west1-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/gentle-keyword-432706-b3/locations/europe-west1/publishers/anthropic/models/claude-3-5-sonnet@20240620:rawPredict "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[09/09/2024 07:30:19 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and propose a path that meets the criteria.

Analysis:
1. The start position is a square from (0,0) to (2,2).
2. The goal position is a square from (18,18) to (20,20).
3. There's one obstacle between the start and goal, positioned diagonally.
4. The obstacle leaves open space both above and below it.
5. A path can be planned to go either above or below the obstacle.
6. Given the positions of the start and goal, going above the obstacle seems more direct.

Proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (5.0, 5.0),    # Move diagonally up and right, away from the start
    (10.0, 19.0),  # Move up and slightly right, avoiding the top of the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set
]

Explanation:
1. The path starts at (1,1), which is within the start set.
2. It then moves diagonally to (5,5), which is well clear of the obstacle.
3. The third point at (10,19) is chosen to go above the obstacle, leaving a good margin of safety.
4. The final point (19,19) is within the goal set.

This path satisfies all the requirements:
- It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
- It avoids the obstacle with a significant margin.
- The linear segments between waypoints do not intersect the obstacle.
- The path is simple and direct while maintaining safety.

[09/09/2024 07:30:26 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct, so we can keep them.
2. The problem occurs in the segment between (5.0, 5.0) and (10.0, 19.0), which intersects with Obstacle 1.
3. Obstacle 1 is positioned in the upper-right quadrant of the space, with its lowest point at approximately (13.9, 16.8).
4. To avoid this obstacle, we need to plan a path that goes around it, preferably below and to the left.

Proposed solution:
1. Keep the start point at (1.0, 1.0).
2. Maintain the second point at (5.0, 5.0) as it's a good intermediate point that doesn't intersect with any obstacles.
3. Instead of going directly to (10.0, 19.0), we'll add two new waypoints to go around the obstacle:
   a. First, move to a point below the obstacle, like (10.0, 15.0).
   b. Then, move to a point to the left of the obstacle, like (5.0, 18.0).
4. From there, we can safely move to a point near the goal, like (18.5, 19.0).
5. Finally, end at the original end point (19.0, 19.0), which is within the goal set.

This path should avoid intersecting with the obstacle while still reaching the goal efficiently.

New path:
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (5.0, 5.0),
    (10.0, 15.0),
    (5.0, 18.0),
    (18.5, 19.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]

This new path starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and should avoid intersecting with the obstacle by going around it. The additional waypoints allow for a more controlled navigation around the obstacle while maintaining a reasonably direct route to the goal.

[09/09/2024 07:30:40 PM] Thank you for the feedback. I'll analyze the situation and provide an improved path that avoids intersecting with the obstacle.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path are correct.
2. The problematic segment is between (5.0, 18.0) and (18.5, 19.0), which intersects with Obstacle 1.
3. Obstacle 1 is positioned in the upper-right quadrant of the space, with its lowest point at approximately (13.9, 16.8).
4. To avoid this obstacle, we need to route the path either above or below it.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Keep the first three waypoints as they are valid and don't intersect with the obstacle.
2. Instead of going directly from (10.0, 15.0) to (5.0, 18.0), we'll add an intermediate point to go below the obstacle.
3. From there, we'll add another point to go around the left side of the obstacle.
4. Finally, we'll add a point to approach the goal set from below and then reach the goal.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 5.0),    # Second point (unchanged)
    (10.0, 15.0),  # Third point (unchanged)
    (12.0, 15.0),  # New point to approach the obstacle from below
    (5.0, 16.0),   # New point to go around the left side of the obstacle
    (17.0, 17.0),  # New point to approach the goal set from below
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point in the goal set (unchanged)
]

This new path should avoid intersecting with Obstacle 1 by going underneath and around its left side before approaching the goal set. The path maintains a safe distance from the obstacle edges to ensure it doesn't touch or cross any part of it.

[09/09/2024 07:31:09 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path are correct, so we can keep them.
2. The main issue is with segments 5 and 6, which intersect with Obstacle 1.
3. Obstacle 1 is an irregularly shaped quadrilateral that spans from approximately (6.3, 17.5) to (19.0, 16.6) at its widest points.
4. We need to find a way around this obstacle, preferably below it since that's closer to our current trajectory.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Keep the first four waypoints as they are valid and don't intersect with the obstacle.
2. Instead of going directly from (12.0, 15.0) to (5.0, 16.0), we'll add an intermediate point to go below the obstacle.
3. From there, we'll add another point to navigate around the lower-right corner of the obstacle.
4. Finally, we'll adjust the last segment to reach the goal set without intersecting the obstacle.

Here's the proposed new path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 5.0),    # Second point (unchanged)
    (10.0, 15.0),  # Third point (unchanged)
    (12.0, 15.0),  # Fourth point (unchanged)
    (13.0, 15.5),  # New point to start navigating around the obstacle
    (14.0, 16.0),  # New point to go below the obstacle
    (18.0, 16.3),  # New point to clear the lower-right corner of the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Adjusted end point, still within the goal set
]

Explanation of changes:
1. The new point (13.0, 15.5) helps us start moving around the obstacle without intersecting it.
2. (14.0, 16.0) ensures we pass below the lowest point of the obstacle (which is at approximately 16.6).
3. (18.0, 16.3) allows us to clear the lower-right corner of the obstacle safely.
4. The final point (19.0, 19.0) remains unchanged as it's within the goal set and doesn't intersect the obstacle.

This new path should avoid intersecting with Obstacle 1 while still meeting all the requirements of starting in the start set, ending in the goal set, and avoiding obstacles.

[09/09/2024 07:31:20 PM] Thank you for the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacle intersection.

Analysis:
The main issue is with the last segment of the path, which intersects with Obstacle 1. This obstacle appears to be a quadrilateral that extends from the lower right towards the upper left. To avoid this obstacle, we need to plan a route that goes around its upper left corner.

Thought process for adjustments:
1. Keep the initial part of the path up to (14.0, 16.0) as it doesn't intersect with any obstacles.
2. Instead of going directly to (18.0, 16.3), we need to curve around the upper left part of the obstacle.
3. We'll add waypoints to navigate around the obstacle's upper left corner, maintaining a safe distance.
4. After clearing the obstacle, we can then proceed to the goal set.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 5.0),    # Intermediate point (unchanged)
    (10.0, 15.0),  # Intermediate point (unchanged)
    (12.0, 15.0),  # Intermediate point (unchanged)
    (13.0, 15.5),  # Intermediate point (unchanged)
    (14.0, 16.0),  # Intermediate point (unchanged)
    (15.0, 17.0),  # New point to start curving around the obstacle
    (16.0, 18.0),  # New point to continue curving
    (17.0, 19.0),  # New point to clear the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point in the goal set
]

Explanation of changes:
1. The path up to (14.0, 16.0) remains the same as it was valid.
2. Instead of going directly to (18.0, 16.3), which intersected the obstacle, we now curve upward and to the right.
3. We added three new waypoints (15.0, 17.0), (16.0, 18.0), and (17.0, 19.0) to create a curve that goes around the upper left corner of the obstacle.
4. The final waypoint (19.0, 19.0) remains in the goal set.

This new path should avoid intersecting with Obstacle 1 while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. The curve around the obstacle's upper left corner provides a safe passage without crossing or touching the obstacle.

### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/09/2024 07:31:29 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path are correct.
2. The obstacle is causing issues for segments 6, 7, and 8 of the path.
3. The obstacle is roughly triangular, with its base along the bottom and its apex towards the top-left.

Thought process for creating a new path:
1. We'll keep the initial segments of the path up to point (13.0, 15.5) as they don't intersect with the obstacle.
2. To avoid the obstacle, we need to go around its left side, as that provides a clearer path to the goal.
3. We'll add more waypoints to curve around the left side of the obstacle, keeping a safe distance.
4. After passing the obstacle, we'll adjust the path to reach the goal set.

New path proposal:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 5.0),    # Unchanged
    (10.0, 15.0),  # Unchanged
    (12.0, 15.0),  # Unchanged
    (13.0, 15.5),  # Unchanged
    (11.0, 16.5),  # New point to start avoiding the obstacle
    (9.0, 17.5),   # New point to curve around the left side of the obstacle
    (10.0, 18.5),  # New point to continue curving
    (12.0, 19.0),  # New point to move towards the goal
    (15.0, 19.5),  # New point to approach the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point in the goal set (unchanged)
]

Explanation of changes:
1. We've added several new waypoints to create a curved path around the left side of the obstacle.
2. The new segment from (13.0, 15.5) to (11.0, 16.5) moves away from the obstacle.
3. The path then curves around with points at (9.0, 17.5) and (10.0, 18.5), giving the obstacle a wide berth.
4. We then added a point at (12.0, 19.0) to start moving back towards the goal area.
5. The point (15.0, 19.5) was added to ensure we approach the goal set from above, avoiding any potential intersection with the top of the obstacle.
6. The final segment connects to the original end point in the goal set.

This new path should avoid intersecting with the obstacle while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. The additional waypoints provide a smoother curve around the obstacle, maintaining a safe distance throughout the path.
