# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[14.6, 14.1], [15.4, 10.7], [17.5, 6.5], [15.0, 13.1]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/09/2024 07:32:10 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and propose a path that meets the criteria.

Analysis:
1. The start position is a 2x2 square in the bottom-left corner.
2. The goal position is a 2x2 square in the top-right corner.
3. There's one obstacle between the start and goal, positioned diagonally.
4. The obstacle doesn't completely block the path, leaving space above and below it.

Path Planning:
1. We'll start from the center of the start square.
2. Move diagonally towards the goal, staying below the obstacle.
3. Once past the obstacle, move directly to the center of the goal square.

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start at the center of the start square
    (8.0, 5.0),  # Move diagonally, staying below the obstacle
    (14.0, 10.0),  # Continue moving diagonally, now past the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End at the center of the goal square
]

Rationale:
1. The path starts within the start set and ends within the goal set.
2. It avoids the obstacle by staying well below it, maintaining a safe distance.
3. The path is simple and direct, using only four waypoints.
4. The diagonal movement allows for efficient progress towards the goal while avoiding the obstacle.
5. The final segment moves directly to the goal once the obstacle is cleared.

This path meets all the requirements: it starts and ends in the correct areas, avoids the obstacle, and provides a clear, obstacle-free route from start to goal.

[09/09/2024 07:32:17 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacle while meeting all requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path are correct, so we'll keep them.
2. The problematic segment is between (14.0, 10.0) and (19.0, 19.0), which intersects with Obstacle 1.
3. Obstacle 1 is roughly shaped like a triangle, with its base at the bottom and point at the top.
4. To avoid this obstacle, we need to either go around it to the left (west) or to the right (east).
5. Going to the left seems more efficient as it's closer to our current path.

Proposed solution:
1. Keep the first three waypoints: (1.0, 1.0), (8.0, 5.0), and (14.0, 10.0).
2. Add a new waypoint to the west of the obstacle, around (13.0, 14.0).
3. Add another waypoint above the obstacle, around (16.0, 15.0).
4. Finally, move to the goal point (19.0, 19.0).

This path should avoid the obstacle while maintaining a safe distance from it.

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (8.0, 5.0),    # Second point (unchanged)
    (14.0, 10.0),  # Third point (unchanged)
    (13.0, 14.0),  # New point to avoid obstacle to the west
    (16.0, 15.0),  # New point to go above the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point (unchanged)
]

This new path should:
1. Start in the correct start set
2. Avoid intersecting with Obstacle 1
3. End in the correct goal set
4. Provide a smooth and efficient route from start to goal

The additional waypoints allow the path to curve around the obstacle, maintaining a safe distance while still reaching the goal efficiently.
