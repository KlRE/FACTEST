# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[19.7, 15.4], [15.8, 13.4], [16.5, 10.8], [19.3, 9.8]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/09/2024 07:27:31 PM] Based on the provided data and instructions, I'll create a path that starts within the start set, ends within the goal set, and avoids the given obstacle. Here's my analysis and the resulting path:

1. The start set is a 2x2 square in the bottom-left corner of the space.
2. The goal set is a 2x2 square in the top-right corner of the space.
3. There's one obstacle between the start and goal, positioned closer to the goal.
4. We need to avoid this obstacle while moving from the start to the goal.

Given this analysis, here's a path that meets the requirements:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start point within the start set
    (10.0, 5.0),  # Move diagonally up and right, staying clear of the obstacle
    (15.0, 10.0),  # Continue moving up and right, passing below the obstacle
    (18.0, 16.0),  # Move up and slightly right, positioning for the final approach
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point within the goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set at (1.0, 1.0).
2. Uses intermediate waypoints to navigate around the obstacle.
3. Ends within the goal set at (19.0, 19.0).
4. Maintains a safe distance from the obstacle throughout its trajectory.
5. Consists of straight-line segments between waypoints that do not intersect with the obstacle.

The path takes a wide berth around the obstacle, first moving diagonally up and right, then passing below and to the left of the obstacle before making a final approach to the goal set. This ensures that even the linear segments between waypoints do not come close to intersecting with the obstacle.

[09/09/2024 07:27:39 PM] HTTP Request: POST https://europe-west1-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/gentle-keyword-432706-b3/locations/europe-west1/publishers/anthropic/models/claude-3-5-sonnet@20240620:rawPredict "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[09/09/2024 07:27:39 PM] Thank you for the feedback. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacle.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path are correct, so we can keep those.
2. The problematic segment is between (15.0, 10.0) and (18.0, 16.0), which intersects with Obstacle 1.
3. Obstacle 1 is positioned in the upper-right quadrant of the space, roughly between x-coordinates 15.8 and 19.7, and y-coordinates 9.8 and 15.4.
4. To avoid this obstacle, we need to either go around it from the left side or below it.

Proposed solution:
1. Keep the first three waypoints as they are valid.
2. Instead of going directly from (15.0, 10.0) to (18.0, 16.0), we'll add intermediate points to go around the obstacle from the left side.
3. After passing the obstacle, we can proceed to the goal.

New path with explanation:
1. (1.0, 1.0) - Start point, within the start set
2. (10.0, 5.0) - First intermediate point, unchanged
3. (15.0, 10.0) - Second intermediate point, unchanged
4. (15.0, 14.0) - New point to move upward, staying left of the obstacle
5. (15.5, 16.0) - New point to start moving right while staying above the obstacle
6. (18.0, 16.5) - New point to continue moving right and slightly up, clearing the obstacle
7. (19.0, 19.0) - End point, within the goal set

This path should avoid intersecting with Obstacle 1 by going around its left side and then above it before reaching the goal.

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (10.0, 5.0),
    (15.0, 10.0),
    (15.0, 14.0),
    (15.5, 16.0),
    (18.0, 16.5),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]

This new path maintains a safe distance from the obstacle while still reaching the goal efficiently.
