# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[17.7, 15.9], [7.6, 14.8], [8.5, 8.3], [14.5, 8.4]]
			Obstacle 2: [[19.0, 17.9], [15.7, 17.1], [15.9, 16.9], [19.8, 16.2]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]

[09/09/2024 07:39:40 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, here's a proposed path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids the given obstacles:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point within the start set
    (3.0, 1.0),    # Move right to avoid Obstacle 1
    (3.0, 7.0),    # Move up to clear both obstacles
    (16.0, 7.0),   # Move right, staying above Obstacle 1
    (16.0, 15.0),  # Move up to clear Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 15.0),  # Move right towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point within the goal set
]

Explanation of the path:

1. The path starts at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start set.
2. It then moves right to (3.0, 1.0) to avoid Obstacle 1.
3. The path goes up to (3.0, 7.0), which is high enough to clear both obstacles.
4. It moves right to (16.0, 7.0), staying above Obstacle 1.
5. The path then goes up to (16.0, 15.0) to clear Obstacle 2.
6. It moves right to (19.0, 15.0), approaching the goal set.
7. Finally, it moves up to (19.0, 19.0), which is within the goal set.

This path maintains a safe distance from both obstacles and does not cross or touch them. It also starts and ends within the specified start and goal sets respectively.

[09/09/2024 07:39:51 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issues are with segments intersecting Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2.
3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 1, which is quite large and positioned diagonally.
4. Obstacle 2 is relatively small and close to the goal, so we'll need to be careful when approaching the goal point.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Start from (1.0, 1.0) as before, which is within the start set.
2. Instead of going directly towards Obstacle 1, we'll move to the left to avoid it entirely.
3. We'll then move upwards, staying to the left of Obstacle 1.
4. After clearing Obstacle 1, we'll move right, staying above it.
5. We'll approach the goal from above, carefully avoiding Obstacle 2.
6. Finally, we'll move down to enter the goal set.

Based on this analysis, here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point within the start set
    (3.0, 1.0),    # Move right initially
    (3.0, 16.0),   # Move up, staying to the left of Obstacle 1
    (15.0, 16.0),  # Move right, staying above Obstacle 1
    (15.0, 18.5),  # Move up slightly to avoid Obstacle 2
    (17.5, 18.5),  # Move right, staying above Obstacle 2
    (17.5, 20.0),  # Move up to align with the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move down and right to end within the goal set
]

This path should avoid both obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. It takes a wider berth around Obstacle 1 and carefully navigates around Obstacle 2 near the goal. The path maintains a safe distance from both obstacles to ensure it doesn't touch or intersect with them.
