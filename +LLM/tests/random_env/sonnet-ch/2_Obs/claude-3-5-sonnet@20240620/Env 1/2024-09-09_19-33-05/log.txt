# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[7.3, 18.1], [12.1, 16.7], [17.7, 19.8], [7.4, 19.2]]
			Obstacle 2: [[10.8, -0.0], [19.7, 0.1], [18.1, 14.4], [11.0, 4.7]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [

[09/09/2024 07:33:12 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and propose a path that avoids the obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set.

Analysis:
1. The start set is a 2x2 square in the bottom-left corner of the space.
2. The goal set is a 2x2 square in the top-right corner of the space.
3. There are two obstacles:
   - Obstacle 1 is in the upper part of the space.
   - Obstacle 2 extends from the bottom to about mid-height of the space on the right side.
4. There's a clear path between these obstacles that we can utilize.

Proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start set
    (5.0, 1.0),  # Move right to avoid Obstacle 2
    (5.0, 15.0),  # Move up, staying clear of Obstacle 2
    (15.0, 15.0),  # Move right, staying below Obstacle 1
    (15.0, 19.0),  # Move up, staying right of Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set
]

Explanation:
1. We start at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start set.
2. We move right to (5.0, 1.0) to clear Obstacle 2 on its left side.
3. We then move up to (5.0, 15.0), which keeps us well clear of Obstacle 2.
4. From there, we move right to (15.0, 15.0), staying below Obstacle 1.
5. We then move up to (15.0, 19.0), staying to the right of Obstacle 1.
6. Finally, we move right to (19.0, 19.0), which is within the goal set.

This path maintains a safe distance from both obstacles and provides a clear, unobstructed route from the start set to the goal set.

[09/09/2024 07:33:20 PM] Thank you for the feedback. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issue is with the segments intersecting Obstacle 1 near the goal.
3. Obstacle 1 is irregularly shaped and positioned in the upper-right quadrant of the space.
4. Obstacle 2 occupies much of the lower-right quadrant but leaves some space near the top.
5. There appears to be a corridor between these obstacles that we can use to reach the goal.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Start from (1.0, 1.0) as before.
2. Move right to (5.0, 1.0) to clear the start area.
3. Instead of going straight up, we'll move diagonally to avoid Obstacle 2.
4. Aim for a point around (7.0, 10.0) which should be clear of both obstacles.
5. From there, move upwards to about (7.0, 17.0) to get above Obstacle 1.
6. Then move right to (16.0, 17.0) to clear Obstacle 1 horizontally.
7. Finally, move diagonally to the goal area, aiming for (19.0, 19.0).

Based on this analysis, here's the proposed new path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (5.0, 1.0),
    (7.0, 10.0),
    (7.0, 17.0),
    (16.0, 17.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]

This path should:
1. Start in the correct start set.
2. Avoid intersecting with both obstacles by maintaining a safe distance.
3. End in the correct goal set.
4. Provide a smooth and efficient route from start to goal.

The path now takes a wider berth around Obstacle 1, moving to the left of it before approaching the goal from above. This should resolve the intersection issues identified in the feedback while maintaining a relatively direct route to the goal.

[09/09/2024 07:33:28 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path are correct.
2. The issue lies with the segment between (7.0, 17.0) and (16.0, 17.0), which intersects Obstacle 1.
3. Obstacle 1 is roughly triangular, with its base along the top of the map and its point extending downwards.
4. Obstacle 2 is a large quadrilateral covering much of the lower right portion of the map.
5. There's a clear passage between these two obstacles that we can utilize.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Keep the starting point at (1.0, 1.0) as it's within the start set.
2. Maintain the initial movement to (5.0, 1.0) as it's clear of obstacles.
3. Instead of going directly to (7.0, 10.0), we'll add an intermediate point to start moving upwards earlier, avoiding Obstacle 2.
4. We'll then navigate around the bottom point of Obstacle 1, keeping a safe distance.
5. Finally, we'll move towards the goal set, ensuring we stay clear of both obstacles.

Based on this analysis, here's the proposed new path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 1.0),   # First waypoint (unchanged)
    (5.0, 8.0),   # Move upwards earlier to avoid Obstacle 2
    (7.0, 15.0),  # Navigate around the bottom of Obstacle 1
    (13.0, 15.0), # Move rightwards while staying below Obstacle 1
    (17.0, 17.0), # Move up and right towards the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End point in the goal set (unchanged)
]

This new path should avoid intersecting with both obstacles while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. The added waypoints allow for a more careful navigation around the obstacles, especially Obstacle 1 which caused the previous intersection issue.
