# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[13.9, 17.7], [10.7, 17.7], [11.7, 15.1], [13.8, 15.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[16.2, 18.7], [15.9, 13.1], [16.2, 12.1], [17.4, 15.4]]

    
## Instructions

    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:

        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

[09/09/2024 07:38:28 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and propose a suitable path:

The start position is a square from (0,0) to (2,2), and the goal is a square from (18,18) to (20,20). There are two obstacles between them: one near the goal and another slightly to its left.

Considering these factors, here's a proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point within the start set
    (5.0, 5.0),    # Move diagonally to avoid obstacles
    (10.0, 10.0),  # Continue diagonal movement
    (14.0, 14.0),  # Approach the goal area
    (15.0, 18.0),  # Move upwards to avoid Obstacle 1
    (17.5, 18.0),  # Move right, staying above both obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point within the goal set
]

Rationale:
1. The path starts at (1,0, 1.0), which is within the start set.
2. It moves diagonally up and right, staying clear of the obstacles.
3. As it approaches the goal area, it moves upward to (15.0, 18.0) to avoid Obstacle 1.
4. It then moves right to (17.5, 18.0), staying above both obstacles.
5. Finally, it moves to (19.0, 19.0), which is within the goal set.

This path maintains a safe distance from both obstacles, doesn't cross them, and satisfies the start and end position requirements.

[09/09/2024 07:38:36 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path are correct.
2. The main issue is with segment 5, which intersects Obstacle 2.
3. We need to route the path around Obstacle 2, while also ensuring we don't intersect with Obstacle 1.
4. There's a clear passage between the two obstacles that we can utilize.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Keep the starting point (1.0, 1.0) as it's within the start set.
2. Maintain the general diagonal approach towards the goal, but adjust to avoid obstacles.
3. Before reaching Obstacle 1, curve the path to pass between the two obstacles.
4. After passing between the obstacles, curve back towards the goal set.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 5.0),    # Maintain initial diagonal approach
    (10.0, 10.0),  # Continue diagonal approach
    (13.0, 14.0),  # Slight adjustment to prepare for obstacle avoidance
    (14.5, 16.5),  # Move between obstacles 1 and 2
    (15.5, 18.5),  # Clear both obstacles
    (17.5, 19.0),  # Approach goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point in goal set
]

Explanation of changes:
1. The first three points remain the same as they don't intersect with any obstacles.
2. The fourth point (13.0, 14.0) is adjusted to prepare for passing between the obstacles.
3. The fifth point (14.5, 16.5) is carefully placed to pass between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2. This point is chosen to maintain a safe distance from both obstacles.
4. The sixth point (15.5, 18.5) ensures we've cleared both obstacles before turning towards the goal set.
5. The seventh point (17.5, 19.0) approaches the goal set while staying clear of Obstacle 2.
6. The final point (19.0, 19.0) is within the goal set, successfully completing the path.

This new path should avoid intersecting with both obstacles while maintaining a smooth trajectory from the start set to the goal set.

[09/09/2024 07:38:43 PM] Thank you for the feedback. I understand that the path needs to be adjusted to avoid intersecting with Obstacle 2. Let's analyze the situation and make the necessary changes.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the path are correct.
2. The problematic segment is between (15.5, 18.5) and (17.5, 19.0), which intersects Obstacle 2.
3. Obstacle 2 is a long, narrow obstacle extending from approximately (16.2, 12.1) to (16.2, 18.7).
4. We need to route the path around this obstacle, preferably to the left since we're coming from that direction.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Keep the initial part of the path up to (14.5, 16.5) as it's valid.
2. Instead of going directly to (15.5, 18.5), we'll add an intermediate point to go around Obstacle 2.
3. We'll route the path to the left of Obstacle 2, then up, and finally to the right towards the goal.
4. We'll maintain a safe distance from the obstacle to ensure we don't touch it.

Based on this analysis, here's the new path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 5.0),    # Waypoint (unchanged)
    (10.0, 10.0),  # Waypoint (unchanged)
    (13.0, 14.0),  # Waypoint (unchanged)
    (14.5, 16.5),  # Waypoint (unchanged)
    (15.0, 17.5),  # New waypoint to start moving around Obstacle 2
    (15.0, 19.0),  # New waypoint to clear the top of Obstacle 2
    (17.5, 19.0),  # Adjusted waypoint to move towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point (unchanged)
]

This new path should avoid intersecting with Obstacle 2 by going around its left side and then proceeding to the goal. The added waypoints (15.0, 17.5) and (15.0, 19.0) help to navigate around the obstacle while maintaining a safe distance. The final approach to the goal remains similar to the original path but should now avoid any intersections.
