# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[7.7, 14.8], [15.5, 14.0], [12.7, 17.4], [8.3, 16.5]]
			Obstacle 2: [[12.9, 19.1], [11.1, 17.5], [12.5, 15.3], [15.8, 15.5]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

[09/09/2024 07:32:55 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and propose a path that meets the criteria.

Analysis:
1. The start area is a 2x2 square in the bottom-left corner.
2. The goal area is a 2x2 square in the top-right corner.
3. There are two obstacles between the start and goal:
   - Obstacle 1 is roughly in the middle-left of the space.
   - Obstacle 2 is near the top-right, partially overlapping with the goal area.
4. There's a clear path between these obstacles, slightly to the right of center.

Proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start area
    (6.0, 6.0),    # Move diagonally up and right, avoiding Obstacle 1
    (11.0, 13.0),  # Continue moving up and right, positioning for the gap
    (14.0, 16.0),  # Move through the gap between Obstacle 1 and 2
    (17.0, 18.0),  # Position just below the goal area
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal area
]

Rationale:
1. The path starts at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start area.
2. It moves diagonally to (6.0, 6.0) to clear Obstacle 1 on its left.
3. The path then continues diagonally to (11.0, 13.0), positioning itself for the gap between obstacles.
4. It passes through the gap at (14.0, 16.0), maintaining distance from both obstacles.
5. The path then moves to (17.0, 18.0), positioning itself just below the goal area and avoiding Obstacle 2.
6. Finally, it ends at (19.0, 19.0), which is within the goal area.

This path satisfies all requirements:
- It starts within the start set and ends within the goal set.
- It avoids all obstacles with a safe margin.
- The linear segments between waypoints do not intersect any obstacles.
- It provides a smooth and efficient route from start to goal.

[09/09/2024 07:33:04 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path are correct.
2. The main issues are with segments 3 and 4, which intersect with both obstacles.
3. We need to find a way to navigate around these obstacles while maintaining a safe distance.

Spatial analysis:
1. There's a narrow passage between the two obstacles on the left side.
2. We can go above both obstacles, but we need to be careful not to get too close to the upper boundary of the environment.
3. Alternatively, we can go below the obstacles, which seems to offer more space.

New path strategy:
1. Start from the same point (1.0, 1.0) in the start set.
2. Move towards the bottom-left of Obstacle 1 to avoid both obstacles.
3. Navigate below both obstacles, maintaining a safe distance.
4. Once past the obstacles, move upwards towards the goal set.
5. End at a point within the goal set.

Based on this analysis, here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (same as before)
    (6.0, 6.0),    # This point is still good, below the obstacles
    (7.5, 10.0),   # Move right and up, staying below obstacles
    (13.0, 11.0),  # Continue right, still below obstacles
    (16.0, 14.0),  # Start moving up towards the goal, past the obstacles
    (18.0, 17.0),  # Continue moving up and right
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point within the goal set
]

This new path should avoid intersecting with the obstacles while maintaining a safe distance. It starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and uses additional waypoints to navigate around the obstacles more carefully. The path moves below the obstacles, which provides more space for maneuvering, and then curves up towards the goal set once it's clear of the obstacles.
