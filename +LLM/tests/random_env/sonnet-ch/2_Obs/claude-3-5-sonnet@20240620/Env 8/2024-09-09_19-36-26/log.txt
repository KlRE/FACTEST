# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[17.2, 15.9], [19.5, 11.3], [19.3, 13.7], [17.4, 18.1]]
			Obstacle 2: [[17.2, 13.6], [11.8, 3.6], [17.3, 2.0], [19.7, 2.7]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]

[09/09/2024 07:36:32 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and propose a suitable path:

The start position is a square from (0,0) to (2,2), and the goal is a square from (18,18) to (20,20). There are two obstacles to avoid:
1. A quadrilateral roughly between (17,11) and (20,18)
2. An irregularly shaped obstacle from about (11,2) to (20,14)

Analyzing the space, there's a clear path along the left side of the obstacles. We can start from the top-right of the start area, move left to avoid the lower obstacle, then up and right towards the goal.

Here's a proposed path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Start at top-right of start area
    (10.0, 2.0),   # Move right, staying below obstacle 2
    (10.0, 16.0),  # Move up, avoiding both obstacles
    (18.0, 16.0),  # Move right, above both obstacles
    (18.0, 18.0)   # Enter the goal area at its bottom-left corner
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set
2. Ends within the goal set
3. Avoids both obstacles with a safe margin
4. Uses straight line segments between waypoints
5. Does not cross any obstacles

The path takes a conservative approach, maintaining a good distance from obstacles to ensure safety. It utilizes the clear space on the left side of the obstacles to navigate from start to goal.

[09/09/2024 07:36:47 PM] Thank you for the feedback. I'll analyze the situation and provide a corrected path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issue is with segments 3 and 4, which intersect with Obstacle 1.
3. We need to route the path around Obstacle 1, keeping a safe distance.
4. Obstacle 2 is lower and to the left, so we should avoid going too far down or left.

Let's adjust the path:

1. Keep the start point at (2.0, 2.0).
2. The second point at (10.0, 2.0) is fine, as it's far from both obstacles.
3. Instead of going directly to (10.0, 16.0), we'll add an intermediate point to go around Obstacle 1.
4. We'll route the path to the left of Obstacle 1, keeping a safe distance.
5. Then we'll move towards the goal, staying above Obstacle 1.
6. Finally, we'll approach the goal from above.

New path with explanations:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Start point, unchanged
    (10.0, 2.0),   # Second point, unchanged
    (10.0, 19.0),  # Move up higher than Obstacle 1
    (16.0, 19.0),  # Move right, staying above Obstacle 1
    (18.0, 19.0),  # Continue right, aligning with the goal
    (18.0, 18.0)   # Move down into the goal area
]

This path should avoid both obstacles:
- It goes around Obstacle 1 by moving up to y=19, which is higher than the obstacle's highest point (18.1).
- It approaches the goal from above, avoiding any potential intersection with Obstacle 1.
- It stays far enough from Obstacle 2, which is lower and to the left.
- The final approach to the goal is vertical, ensuring we don't intersect with Obstacle 1.

This path maintains a safe distance from both obstacles while efficiently moving from the start to the goal area.
