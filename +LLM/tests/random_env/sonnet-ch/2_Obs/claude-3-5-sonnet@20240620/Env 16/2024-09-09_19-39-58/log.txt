# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[7.7, 13.5], [0.2, 3.8], [11.7, 3.4], [14.6, 10.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.2, 20.0], [5.8, 15.8], [10.1, 17.5], [4.1, 19.6]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]

[09/09/2024 07:40:03 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and propose a suitable path:

The start area is a 2x2 square in the bottom-left corner, and the goal area is a 2x2 square in the top-right corner. There are two obstacles between them:

1. A large quadrilateral obstacle in the center-left area.
2. A smaller quadrilateral obstacle in the top-left corner.

To create a safe path, we'll need to avoid these obstacles while moving from the start to the goal. Here's my analysis and proposed path:

1. Start from the top-right corner of the start area to maximize initial distance from obstacles.
2. Move diagonally up and right to get closer to the goal while staying clear of the first obstacle.
3. Continue moving up and right, passing between the two obstacles.
4. Make a final approach to the goal area, entering from the bottom-left corner.

Based on this analysis, here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Start at top-right corner of start area
    (6.0, 6.0),    # Move diagonally to avoid first obstacle
    (12.0, 12.0),  # Continue diagonal movement, staying between obstacles
    (16.0, 16.0),  # Approach goal area
    (18.0, 18.0)   # Enter goal area at bottom-left corner
]

This path should satisfy all the requirements:
- It starts within the start set and ends in the goal set.
- It avoids both obstacles with a safe margin.
- The linear segments between waypoints do not cross any obstacles.
- It provides a relatively smooth and efficient route from start to goal.

[09/09/2024 07:40:11 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start set is a square from (0,0) to (2,2).
2. The goal set is a square from (18,18) to (20,20).
3. Obstacle 1 is a large quadrilateral that blocks a direct path from start to goal.
4. Obstacle 2 is in the upper left corner, not directly interfering with the path to the goal.

Thought process for creating a new path:
1. We need to start by moving away from Obstacle 1.
2. We can go around Obstacle 1 either from the left or the right side.
3. Going from the right side seems more direct and avoids getting close to Obstacle 2.
4. We'll need multiple waypoints to safely navigate around Obstacle 1.
5. After passing Obstacle 1, we can move more directly towards the goal.

Based on this analysis, here's a new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start within the start set
    (6.0, 1.0),     # Move right to avoid Obstacle 1
    (15.0, 3.0),    # Move diagonally up and right, staying below Obstacle 1
    (16.0, 11.0),   # Move upwards, clearing the right side of Obstacle 1
    (18.0, 18.0)    # Move diagonally to the goal set
]

Explanation of the new path:
1. (1.0, 1.0): This point is within the start set.
2. (6.0, 1.0): This moves us to the right, avoiding the lower part of Obstacle 1.
3. (15.0, 3.0): This point takes us diagonally up and right, staying below Obstacle 1.
4. (16.0, 11.0): We move mostly upwards here, clearing the right side of Obstacle 1.
5. (18.0, 18.0): Finally, we move diagonally to reach the goal set.

This path should avoid intersecting with both obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. It provides a smooth trajectory that maintains a safe distance from the obstacles throughout the journey.
