# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[12.2, 19.2], [17.9, 6.3], [19.4, 12.0], [14.2, 18.2]]
			Obstacle 2: [[9.1, 15.1], [3.3, 11.9], [3.5, 11.8], [11.7, 13.5]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

[09/09/2024 07:34:39 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and propose a path that avoids obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set.

Analysis:
1. The start set is a 2x2 square in the bottom-left corner.
2. The goal set is a 2x2 square in the top-right corner.
3. There are two obstacles between the start and goal:
   - Obstacle 1 is an irregular quadrilateral in the upper-right area.
   - Obstacle 2 is a small, nearly triangular shape in the center-left area.
4. There's a clear path between these obstacles, moving diagonally from bottom-left to top-right.

Proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (3.0, 3.0),    # Move diagonally to avoid Obstacle 2
    (8.0, 8.0),    # Continue diagonally, staying clear of both obstacles
    (13.0, 13.0),  # Keep moving diagonally, avoiding Obstacle 1
    (17.0, 17.0),  # Approach the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set
]

Explanation:
1. The path starts at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start set.
2. It then moves diagonally to (3.0, 3.0), which avoids Obstacle 2.
3. The path continues diagonally through (8.0, 8.0) and (13.0, 13.0), maintaining a safe distance from both obstacles.
4. As it approaches the goal, it moves to (17.0, 17.0), staying clear of Obstacle 1.
5. Finally, it ends at (19.0, 19.0), which is within the goal set.

This path satisfies all requirements:
- It starts within the start set and ends within the goal set.
- It avoids both obstacles with a safe margin.
- The linear segments between waypoints do not intersect any obstacles.
- The path is simple and direct, utilizing the clear diagonal space between the obstacles.

[09/09/2024 07:35:13 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and provide a corrected path with my thought process.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct.
2. The main issue is with the segment between (13.0, 13.0) and (17.0, 17.0), which intersects with Obstacle 1.
3. Obstacle 1 is positioned diagonally across the path, so we need to find a way around it.
4. Obstacle 2 is positioned lower and to the left, so we need to ensure we don't create new intersections while avoiding Obstacle 1.

Thought process for correction:
1. Keep the start point (1.0, 1.0) and the first two waypoints (3.0, 3.0) and (8.0, 8.0) as they are valid.
2. From (8.0, 8.0), we need to adjust the path to go around Obstacle 1.
3. Looking at Obstacle 1's coordinates, we can see that going above it or to its right side would be safer.
4. Let's add a waypoint to go above Obstacle 1, around (13.0, 19.5). This point is above the highest y-coordinate of Obstacle 1 (19.2) with a small buffer.
5. From there, we can move towards the goal by adding a waypoint around (18.5, 19.5), which is to the right of Obstacle 1 and close to the goal area.
6. Finally, we can move to the goal point (19.0, 19.0) as in the original path.

New path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (3.0, 3.0),
    (8.0, 8.0),
    (13.0, 19.5),
    (18.5, 19.5),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]

This new path should avoid intersecting with Obstacle 1 by going above it, while also staying clear of Obstacle 2. The path starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and should not cross any obstacles.

        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/09/2024 07:35:23 PM] Thank you for the feedback. I understand that the previous path intersected with obstacles, particularly in the segment between (8.0, 8.0) and (13.0, 19.5). Let's analyze the situation and create a new path that avoids these obstacles.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points were correct, so we can keep those.
2. The main issue is with the middle section of the path, where it intersects both obstacles.
3. Obstacle 1 is positioned higher and to the right, while Obstacle 2 is lower and to the left.
4. There appears to be a gap between these obstacles that we can utilize.

Strategy for the new path:
1. Keep the start point (1.0, 1.0) as it's within the start set.
2. Maintain the initial direction towards (3.0, 3.0) as it's clear of obstacles.
3. Instead of going directly to (8.0, 8.0), we'll add an intermediate point to start avoiding the obstacles.
4. We'll then navigate between the obstacles, keeping a safe distance from both.
5. After passing the obstacles, we'll adjust our course towards the goal set.
6. Finally, we'll end at a point within the goal set.

Based on this analysis, here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (3.0, 3.0),    # Initial direction (unchanged)
    (6.0, 6.0),    # Intermediate point to start avoiding obstacles
    (2.0, 12.0),   # Move left to avoid Obstacle 2
    (7.0, 17.0),   # Navigate between obstacles
    (13.0, 20.0),  # Clear the obstacles, moving towards goal
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point within goal set
]

Explanation of the new path:
1. (1.0, 1.0) to (3.0, 3.0): This segment remains clear of obstacles.
2. (3.0, 3.0) to (6.0, 6.0): We maintain the diagonal trajectory but stop before getting too close to the obstacles.
3. (6.0, 6.0) to (2.0, 12.0): We move left and up, avoiding Obstacle 2 by a safe margin.
4. (2.0, 12.0) to (7.0, 17.0): We navigate diagonally between the two obstacles, keeping a safe distance from both.
5. (7.0, 17.0) to (13.0, 20.0): We move upward and to the right, clearing both obstacles and approaching the goal area.
6. (13.0, 20.0) to (19.0, 19.0): We make a final adjustment to end within the goal set.

This path should avoid intersecting with both obstacles while maintaining a safe distance from them. It starts within the start set and ends within the goal set as required.
