# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[19.4, 10.7], [17.7, 10.6], [18.5, 0.5], [19.7, 0.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[5.9, 3.7], [16.0, 1.2], [17.3, 6.8], [14.7, 7.9]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

[09/09/2024 07:36:18 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and propose a path that avoids obstacles while connecting the start and goal positions.

Analysis:
1. The start area is a 2x2 square in the bottom-left corner.
2. The goal area is a 2x2 square in the top-right corner.
3. There are two obstacles:
   - Obstacle 1 is a long, narrow shape extending from the bottom to about halfway up the space.
   - Obstacle 2 is a larger shape in the lower-middle area of the space.
4. There's a clear path between these obstacles and around them to reach the goal.

Proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start area
    (3.0, 1.0),    # Move right to avoid Obstacle 2
    (3.0, 8.0),    # Move up, staying clear of both obstacles
    (18.0, 8.0),   # Move right, above Obstacle 2 and below Obstacle 1
    (18.0, 19.0)   # Move up to the goal area
]

Rationale:
1. We start at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start area.
2. We move right to (3.0, 1.0) to avoid Obstacle 2.
3. We then move up to (3.0, 8.0), which keeps us clear of both obstacles.
4. From there, we move right to (18.0, 8.0), staying above Obstacle 2 and below Obstacle 1.
5. Finally, we move up to (18.0, 19.0), which is within the goal area.

This path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles, starts within the start area, and ends within the goal area, satisfying all the given requirements.

[09/09/2024 07:36:26 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct.
2. The main issue was with segments 3 and 4, which intersected with Obstacle 1.
3. We need to route the path around Obstacle 1 while also avoiding Obstacle 2.
4. There's a clear passage between the two obstacles that we can utilize.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Keep the starting point (1.0, 1.0) as it's within the start set.
2. We'll move upward earlier to avoid Obstacle 2.
3. Then we'll move right, staying above Obstacle 2 but below Obstacle 1.
4. After passing both obstacles, we'll move up towards the goal set.
5. Finally, we'll adjust to end within the goal set.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (1.0, 9.0),    # Move up early to avoid Obstacle 2
    (17.0, 9.0),   # Move right, staying above Obstacle 2 and below Obstacle 1
    (17.0, 19.0),  # Move up towards the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point within the goal set
]

Explanation of the new path:
1. (1.0, 1.0) to (1.0, 9.0): This vertical movement avoids Obstacle 2 entirely.
2. (1.0, 9.0) to (17.0, 9.0): This horizontal movement passes above Obstacle 2 and below Obstacle 1. The y-coordinate of 9.0 provides a safe margin from both obstacles.
3. (17.0, 9.0) to (17.0, 19.0): This vertical movement brings us close to the goal set while staying clear of Obstacle 1.
4. (17.0, 19.0) to (19.0, 19.0): This final horizontal movement ensures we end within the goal set.

This path should successfully avoid both obstacles while meeting all the specified requirements. It starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and maintains a safe distance from all obstacles throughout its course.
