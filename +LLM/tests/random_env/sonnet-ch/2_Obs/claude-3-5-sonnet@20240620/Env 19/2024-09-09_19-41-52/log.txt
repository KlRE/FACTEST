# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[11.2, 6.1], [16.4, 6.3], [20.0, 14.0], [16.4, 11.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[8.0, 13.5], [11.3, 8.9], [16.0, 19.7], [8.8, 14.8]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

[09/09/2024 07:42:01 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and propose a path that meets the criteria.

Analysis:
1. The start area is a 2x2 square at the bottom-left of the space.
2. The goal area is a 2x2 square at the top-right of the space.
3. There are two obstacles between the start and goal:
   - Obstacle 1 is roughly in the middle-right area.
   - Obstacle 2 is in the upper-left area.
4. There's a clear path between these obstacles, moving diagonally from bottom-left to top-right.

Proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start area
    (7.0, 7.0),  # Move diagonally to avoid both obstacles
    (14.0, 14.0),  # Continue diagonal movement
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End within the goal area
]

Rationale:
1. The path starts at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start area.
2. The first waypoint (7.0, 7.0) is chosen to keep a safe distance from both obstacles.
3. The second waypoint (14.0, 14.0) continues the diagonal movement, staying clear of both obstacles.
4. The final waypoint (19.0, 19.0) is within the goal area.

This path maintains a safe distance from both obstacles while providing a smooth, direct route from the start to the goal. The diagonal movement allows for efficient navigation through the space between the obstacles.

[09/09/2024 07:42:08 PM] HTTP Request: POST https://europe-west1-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/gentle-keyword-432706-b3/locations/europe-west1/publishers/anthropic/models/claude-3-5-sonnet@20240620:rawPredict "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[09/09/2024 07:42:08 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct, so we can keep those.
2. The main issue is with the segment between (7.0, 7.0) and (14.0, 14.0), which intersects Obstacle 2.
3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 2 while also avoiding Obstacle 1.
4. Looking at the obstacle positions, there seems to be a passage between them that we can utilize.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Keep the start point at (1.0, 1.0) as it's within the start set.
2. We can keep the second point at (7.0, 7.0) as it doesn't intersect any obstacles.
3. Instead of going directly to (14.0, 14.0), we'll add intermediate points to go around Obstacle 2:
   a. First, we'll go to a point just below Obstacle 2, around (7.5, 8.0).
   b. Then, we'll move to a point that's between the two obstacles, around (10.0, 7.5).
   c. Next, we'll go to a point above both obstacles, around (17.0, 15.0).
4. From there, we can safely proceed to the goal area.
5. Keep the end point at (19.0, 19.0) as it's within the goal set.

Based on this analysis, here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (7.0, 7.0),    # Intermediate point (unchanged)
    (7.5, 8.0),    # New point to avoid Obstacle 2
    (10.0, 7.5),   # New point between obstacles
    (17.0, 15.0),  # New point above both obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point (unchanged)
]

This new path should avoid both obstacles while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. The additional waypoints allow the path to navigate around Obstacle 2 without intersecting it, and also maintain a safe distance from Obstacle 1.
