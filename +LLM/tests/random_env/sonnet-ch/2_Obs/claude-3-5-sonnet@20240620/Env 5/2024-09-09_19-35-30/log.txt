# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[0.1, 16.4], [9.5, 16.3], [9.5, 17.7], [9.3, 19.9]]
			Obstacle 2: [[11.3, 16.4], [11.0, 12.7], [18.4, 12.3], [19.8, 14.1]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

[09/09/2024 07:35:57 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and propose a path that avoids obstacles while meeting the start and goal conditions.

Analysis:
1. The start area is a 2x2 square in the bottom-left corner.
2. The goal area is a 2x2 square in the top-right corner.
3. There are two obstacles:
   - Obstacle 1 is in the upper-left area, stretching from about x=0 to x=9.5.
   - Obstacle 2 is in the lower-right area, stretching from about y=12.3 to y=16.4.
4. There's a clear path between these obstacles diagonally from bottom-left to top-right.

Proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start within the start area
    (10.0, 10.0),   # Move diagonally to a point clear of both obstacles
    (15.0, 15.0),   # Continue moving diagonally towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End within the goal area
]

Rationale:
1. The path starts at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start area.
2. It then moves diagonally to (10.0, 10.0), which is clear of Obstacle 1 to the north and Obstacle 2 to the east.
3. The path continues diagonally to (15.0, 15.0), maintaining a safe distance from both obstacles.
4. Finally, it ends at (19.0, 19.0), which is within the goal area.

This path maintains a good distance from both obstacles, ensuring it doesn't cross or touch them. The diagonal movement provides an efficient route from start to goal while avoiding the obstacles.

[09/09/2024 07:36:06 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issue is that the path intersects with Obstacle 2 in two segments.
3. We need to route the path around Obstacle 2, preferably above it since that's closer to the goal.
4. We also need to consider Obstacle 1, which is located in the upper-left part of the space.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Start at (1.0, 1.0) as before, since it's within the start set.
2. Instead of going directly towards (10.0, 10.0), we'll add an intermediate point to start moving upwards earlier, avoiding Obstacle 2.
3. We'll then add a point above Obstacle 2 to ensure we clear it completely.
4. Next, we'll add a point to the right of Obstacle 2, allowing us to move towards the goal without intersecting the obstacle.
5. Finally, we'll end at (19.0, 19.0) as before, since it's within the goal set.

New path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (same as before)
    (5.0, 10.0),   # Move upwards earlier to avoid Obstacle 2
    (10.0, 17.0),  # Point above Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 17.0),  # Point to the right of Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point (same as before)
]

Explanation of the new path:
1. (1.0, 1.0) to (5.0, 10.0): This segment moves diagonally upward, staying clear of both obstacles.
2. (5.0, 10.0) to (10.0, 17.0): This segment continues moving upward and slightly to the right, passing above Obstacle 2 and to the left of Obstacle 1.
3. (10.0, 17.0) to (19.0, 17.0): This segment moves horizontally to the right, staying above Obstacle 2 and below Obstacle 1.
4. (19.0, 17.0) to (19.0, 19.0): This final segment moves vertically upward into the goal set.

This path should avoid both obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. It provides a smooth trajectory that doesn't intersect with any obstacles and maintains a safe distance from them.
