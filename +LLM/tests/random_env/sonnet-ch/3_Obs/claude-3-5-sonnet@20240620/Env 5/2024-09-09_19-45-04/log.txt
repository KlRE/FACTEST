# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[2.5, 12.5], [12.6, 13.6], [12.4, 17.1], [2.7, 15.1]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.6, 16.2], [5.3, 11.9], [13.6, 7.0], [8.9, 14.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[16.0, 18.8], [8.8, 15.2], [18.9, 15.2], [19.6, 16.1]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

[09/09/2024 07:45:11 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and propose a path that avoids the obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set.

Analysis:
1. The start set is a square from (0,0) to (2,2).
2. The goal set is a square from (18,18) to (20,20).
3. There are three obstacles to avoid:
   - Obstacle 1 is roughly in the center-left of the space.
   - Obstacle 2 stretches diagonally from the bottom-left to the center.
   - Obstacle 3 is near the top-right, close to the goal.

Path Strategy:
1. Start from the top-right corner of the start set.
2. Move diagonally up and right to avoid Obstacle 2.
3. Continue moving up and right, passing above Obstacle 1.
4. Navigate around Obstacle 3 by moving right, then up.
5. Finally, approach the goal set from the left.

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Start at top-right corner of start set
    (6.0, 6.0),    # Move diagonally to avoid Obstacle 2
    (10.0, 14.0),  # Continue diagonally, staying above Obstacle 1
    (14.0, 18.0),  # Move towards the goal, avoiding Obstacle 3
    (17.0, 18.0),  # Move right to clear Obstacle 3
    (17.0, 19.0),  # Move up to approach goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set at (2.0, 2.0).
2. Ends within the goal set at (19.0, 19.0).
3. Avoids all obstacles with a safe margin.
4. Uses straight-line segments between waypoints.
5. Does not cross or touch any obstacles.

The path takes a somewhat curved approach to navigate around all obstacles efficiently while maintaining a safe distance from them.

[09/09/2024 07:45:19 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issues are with segments 2, 3, 4, and 5, which intersect with various obstacles.
3. We need to find a path that avoids Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2, which are blocking the direct route.
4. There's a narrow passage between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3 that we can potentially use.
5. We should also keep the path away from the upper right corner where Obstacle 3 is located.

New path strategy:
1. Start from (2.0, 2.0) as before.
2. Move towards the right to avoid Obstacle 2.
3. Then move upwards, staying to the right of Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2.
4. Navigate through the gap between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3.
5. Finally, approach the goal from the right side to avoid Obstacle 3.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Start point
    (14.0, 2.0),   # Move right to avoid Obstacle 2
    (14.0, 12.0),  # Move up, staying right of Obstacle 1 and 2
    (13.0, 16.0),  # Navigate through the gap between Obstacle 1 and 3
    (16.0, 17.0),  # Move towards the goal, avoiding Obstacle 3
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point within the goal set
]

Explanation of the new path:
1. The first segment (2.0, 2.0) to (14.0, 2.0) moves right, staying below all obstacles.
2. The second segment (14.0, 2.0) to (14.0, 12.0) moves up, avoiding Obstacle 2 on the left.
3. The third segment (14.0, 12.0) to (13.0, 16.0) navigates through the gap between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3, staying clear of both.
4. The fourth segment (13.0, 16.0) to (16.0, 17.0) moves towards the goal while avoiding Obstacle 3.
5. The final segment (16.0, 17.0) to (19.0, 19.0) reaches the goal set without intersecting any obstacles.

This path should avoid all obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. It takes a wider route around the obstacles to ensure clearance and avoid any potential intersections.

[09/09/2024 07:45:26 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issue is with the path segments intersecting Obstacle 3, which is located in the upper-right corner of the space.
3. We need to route the path around Obstacle 3 while also avoiding Obstacles 1 and 2.
4. There appears to be a clear passage between Obstacles 1 and 2, which we can utilize.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Start from (2.0, 2.0) as before.
2. Move right to (14.0, 2.0) to clear Obstacle 2.
3. Move up to (14.0, 10.0) to position ourselves below Obstacle 1.
4. Move right to (17.0, 10.0) to clear Obstacle 1 and position ourselves to the right of it.
5. Move up to (17.0, 15.0) to reach a point above Obstacle 1 but below Obstacle 3.
6. Move right to (20.0, 15.0) to clear Obstacle 3.
7. Finally, move up to (19.0, 19.0) to end in the goal set.

This path should avoid all obstacles while maintaining a safe distance from them. It utilizes the clear spaces between obstacles and takes a more circuitous route to ensure obstacle avoidance.

New path:
new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),
    (14.0, 2.0),
    (14.0, 10.0),
    (17.0, 10.0),
    (17.0, 15.0),
    (20.0, 15.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]

This path starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and should avoid intersecting with any of the obstacles while maintaining a safe distance from them.
