# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[14.3, 20.0], [13.8, 19.0], [16.5, 15.4], [19.7, 15.3]]
			Obstacle 2: [[18.6, 16.4], [14.0, 14.8], [14.5, 7.3], [18.3, 13.7]]
			Obstacle 3: [[3.2, 6.4], [2.8, 1.2], [10.4, 5.7], [13.6, 7.6]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

[09/09/2024 07:49:44 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and propose a path that avoids obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set.

Analysis:
1. The start set is a 2x2 square in the bottom-left corner.
2. The goal set is a 2x2 square in the top-right corner.
3. There are three obstacles between the start and goal:
   - Obstacle 1 is in the upper-right area
   - Obstacle 2 extends from the middle to the right side
   - Obstacle 3 is in the lower-left area

Strategy:
1. Start from the top-right corner of the start set to maximize initial distance from Obstacle 3.
2. Move diagonally up and right, staying clear of Obstacle 3.
3. Navigate between Obstacles 2 and 3.
4. Move upwards, keeping distance from Obstacle 2.
5. Navigate between Obstacles 1 and 2.
6. Approach the goal set from the bottom-left, ending in its bottom-left corner.

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Start at top-right corner of start set
    (6.0, 6.0),    # Move diagonally to avoid Obstacle 3
    (12.0, 10.0),  # Navigate between Obstacles 2 and 3
    (14.0, 14.0),  # Move upwards, keeping clear of Obstacle 2
    (16.0, 17.0),  # Navigate between Obstacles 1 and 2
    (18.0, 18.0)   # End at bottom-left corner of goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set
2. Ends within the goal set
3. Avoids all obstacles with a safe margin
4. Uses straight line segments between waypoints
5. Does not cross any obstacles

The path takes a somewhat curved route to maintain safe distances from all obstacles while efficiently moving towards the goal.

[09/09/2024 07:49:51 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and adjust the path accordingly.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, but we need to avoid intersecting with the obstacles.
2. Obstacle 3 is causing issues for the first two segments of the path.
3. Obstacles 1 and 2 are causing problems for the last two segments of the path.
4. We need to find a route that goes around these obstacles while maintaining a safe distance.

Adjustments:
1. Start point: We'll keep (2.0, 2.0) as it's within the start set and not intersecting any obstacles.
2. To avoid Obstacle 3, we'll go around it from the left side. We'll add a waypoint at (1.5, 8.0) to safely clear the obstacle.
3. After clearing Obstacle 3, we'll move towards the goal, but we need to be careful of Obstacles 1 and 2.
4. We'll add a waypoint at (13.0, 12.0) to approach the goal area while staying clear of Obstacle 2.
5. To avoid Obstacle 1, we'll go around it from the right side. We'll add a waypoint at (17.0, 16.0).
6. Finally, we'll end at (19.0, 19.0), which is within the goal set.

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Start point
    (1.5, 8.0),    # Go around Obstacle 3 from the left
    (13.0, 12.0),  # Move towards goal area, avoiding Obstacle 2
    (17.0, 16.0),  # Go around Obstacle 1 from the right
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point within goal set
]

This path should avoid all obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. The waypoints are chosen to provide enough clearance from the obstacles, and the linear segments between them should not intersect with any obstacles.

[09/09/2024 07:50:00 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. Let's analyze the situation and create a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issue is with segments 3 and 4, which intersect with Obstacles 1 and 2.
3. We need to find a way around these obstacles while maintaining a safe distance.

Let's think through a new path:

1. We'll keep the starting point at (2.0, 2.0) as it's within the start set.
2. The second point at (1.5, 8.0) is good as it avoids Obstacle 3.
3. Instead of going directly to (13.0, 12.0), we need to go around Obstacle 2.
4. We can move to a point just below Obstacle 2, then to a point to its right.
5. From there, we need to navigate around Obstacle 1 to reach the goal.

Considering these factors, here's a new path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Start point
    (1.5, 8.0),    # Avoid Obstacle 3
    (12.0, 6.0),   # Move below Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 6.0),   # Move to the right of Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 14.0),  # Move up, staying to the right of Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point within the goal set
]

Explanation of the new path:
1. (2.0, 2.0) to (1.5, 8.0): This segment remains unchanged as it successfully avoids Obstacle 3.
2. (1.5, 8.0) to (12.0, 6.0): This new segment goes below Obstacle 2, maintaining a safe distance.
3. (12.0, 6.0) to (19.0, 6.0): This segment moves to the right of Obstacle 2, avoiding both Obstacles 2 and 3.
4. (19.0, 6.0) to (19.0, 14.0): This vertical segment stays to the right of both Obstacles 1 and 2.
5. (19.0, 14.0) to (19.0, 19.0): The final segment moves up to the goal set, staying clear of Obstacle 1.

This path should avoid all obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. It takes a wider berth around the obstacles to ensure no intersections occur.

    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

[09/09/2024 07:50:09 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issues are with segments intersecting Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 1.
3. We need to navigate around Obstacle 3 more carefully.
4. We should avoid going too close to Obstacle 1 near the goal.

Let's adjust the path:

1. Keep (2.0, 2.0) as the starting point.
2. Instead of going directly to (1.5, 8.0), let's go around Obstacle 3 from the left side.
3. We'll add a point to navigate around Obstacle 3's left side.
4. After passing Obstacle 3, we can move towards the right side of the space.
5. We'll keep the point (19.0, 6.0) as it's a good waypoint far from obstacles.
6. To avoid Obstacle 1, we'll move up to a point below it before heading to the goal.
7. Finally, we'll enter the goal area from the bottom-right corner.

Based on this analysis, here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),     # Start point
    (1.5, 4.0),     # Move up to prepare to go around Obstacle 3
    (1.0, 7.0),     # Go around the left side of Obstacle 3
    (12.0, 8.0),    # Move right after passing Obstacle 3
    (19.0, 6.0),    # Keep this point as it's good
    (19.0, 13.0),   # Move up, staying right of Obstacle 2
    (17.5, 17.0),   # Move left and up, avoiding Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 19.0)    # Enter the goal area
]

This path should:
1. Start in the correct start set
2. Avoid all obstacles by maintaining a safe distance
3. End in the correct goal set
4. Provide a smooth and efficient route from start to finish

The path now goes around Obstacle 3 from the left, moves to the right side of the space to avoid Obstacle 2, and then carefully navigates around Obstacle 1 to reach the goal. This should resolve the intersection issues mentioned in the feedback while maintaining a practical and efficient route.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issues are with segments 4, 6, and 7, which intersect with obstacles.
3. We need to adjust the path to go around Obstacle 3, then find a way between Obstacles 1 and 2 to reach the goal.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Start at (2.0, 2.0) as before.
2. Keep the initial waypoints (1.5, 4.0) and (1.0, 7.0) as they avoid obstacles.
3. Instead of going directly to (12.0, 8.0), we'll go around Obstacle 3 by moving to (1.0, 9.0) and then (14.0, 9.0).
4. To avoid Obstacle 2, we'll move up to (14.0, 15.0).
5. We'll then navigate between Obstacles 1 and 2 by moving to (17.0, 15.0).
6. Finally, we'll move to the goal by going to (19.0, 19.0).

Here's the new proposed path:

    (14.0, 15.0),
    (17.0, 15.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]

This path should:
1. Start in the correct start set.
2. Avoid all obstacles by maintaining a safe distance.
3. End in the correct goal set.
4. Consist of linear segments that don't intersect with any obstacles.

The path now goes around Obstacle 3 to the north, moves up between Obstacles 2 and 3, and then navigates the narrow passage between Obstacles 1 and 2 before reaching the goal. This should resolve all the intersection issues mentioned in the feedback while maintaining a smooth and efficient path.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issues occur in the latter part of the path, specifically from waypoint 5 onwards.
3. We need to avoid Obstacle 2, which extends from y=7.3 to y=16.4 in the x range of 14.0 to 18.6.
4. We also need to avoid Obstacle 1, which is in the upper right corner.

Proposed changes:
1. Keep the first 4 waypoints as they are valid.
2. Instead of going directly north at x=14, we'll move northeast to avoid Obstacle 2.
3. We'll add a waypoint to go around the top of Obstacle 2.
4. Then, we'll add another waypoint to navigate between Obstacles 1 and 2.
5. Finally, we'll adjust the last waypoint to reach the goal area without intersecting any obstacles.
