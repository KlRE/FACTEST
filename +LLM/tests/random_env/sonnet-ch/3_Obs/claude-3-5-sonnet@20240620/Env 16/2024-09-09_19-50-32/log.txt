# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[13.9, 6.0], [16.8, 7.1], [16.4, 16.0], [14.1, 11.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[19.7, 17.5], [17.2, 17.5], [18.2, 17.3], [19.3, 17.3]]
			Obstacle 3: [[10.7, 8.3], [16.3, 0.8], [17.5, 12.2], [16.4, 14.6]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/09/2024 07:50:39 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and propose a path that meets the criteria.

Analysis:
1. The start area is a 2x2 square at the bottom-left corner of the space.
2. The goal area is a 2x2 square at the top-right corner of the space.
3. There are three obstacles between the start and goal:
   - Obstacle 1 is roughly in the middle-left area.
   - Obstacle 2 is very close to the goal area.
   - Obstacle 3 is a large obstacle covering much of the lower-right area.
4. There appears to be a clear path along the left side of the space, then curving towards the top-right to reach the goal.

Proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start area
    (1.0, 8.0),    # Move up along the left side, avoiding Obstacle 1
    (8.0, 12.0),   # Move diagonally up and right, staying clear of Obstacle 3
    (12.0, 16.0),  # Continue moving up and right, avoiding Obstacle 1
    (16.0, 18.0),  # Approach the goal area, staying below Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal area
]

Reasoning:
1. The path starts at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start area.
2. It first moves straight up to (1.0, 8.0) to avoid Obstacle 3 and get past the left side of Obstacle 1.
3. Then it moves diagonally to (8.0, 12.0) and (12.0, 16.0), maintaining a safe distance from Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 1.
4. The path then moves to (16.0, 18.0), staying below Obstacle 2.
5. Finally, it ends at (19.0, 19.0), which is within the goal area.

This path should satisfy all the requirements:
- It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
- It avoids all obstacles with a safe margin.
- The linear segments between waypoints do not intersect any obstacles.
- It provides a smooth and efficient route from start to goal.
