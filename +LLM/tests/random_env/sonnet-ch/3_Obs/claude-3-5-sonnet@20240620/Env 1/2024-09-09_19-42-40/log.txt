# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[16.6, 20.0], [15.6, 15.9], [15.6, 15.3], [19.9, 14.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[5.1, 4.4], [13.8, 1.7], [13.5, 9.8], [11.4, 14.8]]
			Obstacle 3: [[5.1, 18.4], [6.6, 16.6], [7.5, 18.3], [5.5, 18.7]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/09/2024 07:42:46 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and propose a path that avoids obstacles while meeting the start and end conditions.

Analysis:
1. The start area is a 2x2 square in the bottom-left corner.
2. The goal area is a 2x2 square in the top-right corner.
3. Obstacle 1 is near the goal, partially blocking direct access.
4. Obstacle 2 is a large obstacle in the central area.
5. Obstacle 3 is a small obstacle in the upper-left quadrant.

Path Strategy:
1. Start from the top-right corner of the start area.
2. Move diagonally up and right, staying clear of Obstacle 2.
3. Navigate around Obstacle 3 by going above it.
4. Continue moving towards the goal, avoiding Obstacle 1 by going around its left side.
5. Enter the goal area from the bottom-left corner.

Proposed path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Start at top-right corner of start area
    (4.5, 4.5),    # Move diagonally up and right
    (4.5, 19.0),   # Move upwards, staying left of Obstacle 2
    (8.0, 19.0),   # Move right, above Obstacle 3
    (15.0, 19.0),  # Continue right, staying above Obstacle 2
    (15.0, 21.0),  # Move up slightly to clear Obstacle 1
    (18.5, 21.0),  # Move right, above Obstacle 1
    (18.5, 19.0),  # Move down to approach goal area
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Enter goal area at its bottom-left corner
]

This path starts within the start set, ends within the goal set, and avoids all obstacles with a safe margin. The waypoints are connected linearly, and the path does not cross any obstacles.
