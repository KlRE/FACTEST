# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[10.3, 15.5], [15.0, 10.5], [19.1, 15.1], [15.1, 16.2]]
			Obstacle 2: [[4.0, 18.1], [10.2, 16.6], [13.3, 18.7], [12.7, 19.7]]
			Obstacle 3: [[14.3, 14.9], [6.2, 6.6], [8.9, 5.2], [9.7, 5.1]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

[09/09/2024 07:52:14 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and propose a path that avoids obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set.

Analysis:
1. The start set is a 2x2 square in the bottom-left corner of the environment.
2. The goal set is a 2x2 square in the top-right corner.
3. There are three obstacles forming a rough diagonal from bottom-left to top-right.
4. There's a clear path between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2 in the top-left area.
5. There's also a path between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3 in the middle-right area.

Path Strategy:
1. Start from the top-right corner of the start set.
2. Move diagonally up and right, staying below Obstacle 2.
3. Pass between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2.
4. Move towards the right, staying above Obstacle 3.
5. Finally, approach the goal set from the left.

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Start at the top-right corner of the start set
    (3.5, 15.0),   # Move diagonally up and right, staying below Obstacle 2
    (11.0, 17.5),  # Pass between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2
    (16.0, 17.0),  # Move right, staying above Obstacle 3
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End in the goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set at (2.0, 2.0).
2. Avoids all obstacles by maintaining a safe distance.
3. Does not cross any obstacles.
4. Ends within the goal set at (19.0, 19.0).
5. Uses linear segments between waypoints for simplicity and clarity.

The path takes advantage of the clear spaces between obstacles while maintaining a safe distance from them. It provides a smooth and efficient route from the start to the goal while satisfying all the given requirements.

[09/09/2024 07:52:24 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issue is with segments 2 and 3, which intersect with Obstacle 2.
3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 2 while also avoiding Obstacles 1 and 3.
4. There's a clear path between Obstacles 1 and 2, which we can utilize.
5. After passing Obstacle 2, we need to navigate carefully to avoid Obstacle 1 before reaching the goal.

Proposed solution:
1. Keep the start point at (2.0, 2.0).
2. Move towards the gap between Obstacles 1 and 2, but stay below Obstacle 2.
3. Pass through the gap between Obstacles 1 and 2.
4. Move upwards and then towards the goal, avoiding Obstacle 1.
5. End at the goal point (19.0, 19.0).

Here's the new path with explanations:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Start point, same as before
    (3.0, 10.0),   # Move up and slightly right, staying clear of Obstacle 3
    (5.0, 15.0),   # Continue moving up, positioning to pass between Obstacles 1 and 2
    (11.0, 15.5),  # Move right, passing below Obstacle 2
    (14.0, 16.5),  # Continue right and slightly up, now past Obstacle 2
    (17.0, 18.0),  # Move up and right, avoiding Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point in the goal set
]

This path should avoid all obstacles:
- It starts by moving upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 3.
- It then positions itself to pass between Obstacles 1 and 2.
- After passing Obstacle 2, it carefully navigates around Obstacle 1.
- Finally, it reaches the goal set without intersecting any obstacles.

The additional waypoints provide more precise control over the path, ensuring it doesn't intersect with any obstacles while maintaining a safe distance from them.

[09/09/2024 07:52:33 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issue is with segments 3 and 4, which intersect with Obstacle 1.
3. We need to route the path around Obstacle 1, preferably to the left since that seems to have more open space.
4. We should also ensure we stay clear of Obstacle 2, which is in the upper part of the space.
5. Obstacle 3 is in the lower part of the space and doesn't directly interfere with our current path, but we should be mindful of it.

Proposed changes:
1. Keep the first two waypoints (2.0, 2.0) and (3.0, 10.0) as they are valid.
2. Instead of going directly to (5.0, 15.0), we'll add an intermediate point to go around Obstacle 1 to the left.
3. We'll then add a point to navigate between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2.
4. Finally, we'll adjust the approach to the goal set to avoid coming too close to Obstacle 1.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (3.0, 10.0),   # Second point (unchanged)
    (4.0, 13.0),   # New point to start moving left of Obstacle 1
    (8.0, 14.5),   # Point to pass left of Obstacle 1
    (12.0, 17.0),  # Point between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2
    (16.0, 17.5),  # Point to approach goal set while avoiding Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point in goal set (unchanged)
]

Explanation of changes:
1. The new point (4.0, 13.0) helps us start moving to the left of Obstacle 1 earlier.
2. (8.0, 14.5) ensures we pass safely to the left of Obstacle 1 without getting too close to Obstacle 3.
3. (12.0, 17.0) allows us to navigate between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2 safely.
4. (16.0, 17.5) provides a safe approach to the goal set without getting too close to the upper right corner of Obstacle 1.

This new path should avoid all obstacles while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. The additional waypoints provide a smoother and safer trajectory around the obstacles.
