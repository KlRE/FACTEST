# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.1, 13.0], [17.5, 10.6], [17.5, 19.3], [15.5, 17.6]]
			Obstacle 2: [[18.2, 12.2], [7.8, 10.0], [9.3, 4.6], [15.3, 1.7]]
			Obstacle 3: [[4.9, 10.3], [11.8, 9.6], [13.7, 19.3], [7.6, 19.1]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

[09/09/2024 07:48:17 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and propose a path that meets the criteria.

Analysis:
1. The start area is a 2x2 square in the bottom-left corner.
2. The goal area is a 2x2 square in the top-right corner.
3. There are three obstacles creating a complex environment:
   - Obstacle 1 is near the goal, creating a narrow passage.
   - Obstacle 2 spans diagonally across the middle.
   - Obstacle 3 is in the upper-left quadrant.
4. There's a clear path along the right side of the environment, between Obstacle 1 and the right boundary.

Path Planning:
1. Start from the top-right corner of the start area.
2. Move diagonally up and right to avoid Obstacle 2.
3. Continue moving up and slightly right to pass between Obstacle 1 and the right boundary.
4. Finally, move left into the goal area.

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Start at top-right corner of start area
    (6.0, 6.0),    # Move diagonally to avoid Obstacle 2
    (12.0, 12.0),  # Continue diagonal movement
    (18.0, 17.0),  # Move up, staying right of Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End in the goal area
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set
2. Ends within the goal set
3. Avoids all obstacles with a safe margin
4. Uses linear segments between waypoints
5. Does not cross any obstacles

The path takes advantage of the clear space on the right side of the environment, avoiding the complex interactions between Obstacles 2 and 3, and navigates the narrow passage created by Obstacle 1 near the goal.

[09/09/2024 07:48:24 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issue is that the path intersects with multiple obstacles, particularly in the middle segments.
3. We need to find a route that avoids all obstacles while maintaining a safe distance from them.

Spatial analysis:
1. There's a narrow passage between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2 in the upper right quadrant.
2. There's also a passage between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3 on the left side.
3. We can utilize these passages to navigate around the obstacles.

Path planning:
1. Start from (2.0, 2.0) in the start set.
2. Move towards the passage between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3, but stay below Obstacle 3.
3. Navigate through this passage, keeping a safe distance from both obstacles.
4. Once past Obstacle 2, move upwards towards the narrow passage between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2.
5. Carefully pass through this narrow passage, maintaining distance from both obstacles.
6. After clearing Obstacle 1, move towards the goal set.

Based on this analysis, here's the proposed new path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Start point
    (6.0, 3.0),    # Move right and slightly up, staying below Obstacle 3
    (11.0, 5.0),   # Continue moving right and up, passing between Obstacle 2 and 3
    (14.0, 9.0),   # Move up towards the passage between Obstacle 1 and 2
    (16.0, 14.0),  # Navigate through the narrow passage
    (17.0, 17.0),  # Move towards the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point in the goal set
]

This path should avoid all obstacles while maintaining a safe distance from them. It utilizes the available passages between obstacles to navigate safely from the start to the goal. The path begins in the start set and ends in the goal set as required.

[09/09/2024 07:48:33 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep them.
2. The main issue is that the path intersects with multiple obstacles, particularly Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2.
3. We need to find a route that goes around these obstacles while maintaining a safe distance.

Spatial analysis:
1. Obstacle 3 is mostly in the lower half of the space, so we can aim to stay above it.
2. Obstacle 2 spans a large portion of the middle area, so we need to go either above or below it.
3. Obstacle 1 creates a narrow passage on the right side of the space.

Strategy:
1. Start from (2.0, 2.0) as before.
2. Move upwards to avoid Obstacle 2.
3. Navigate around the top of Obstacle 3.
4. Move towards the right, staying above Obstacle 2.
5. Navigate through the gap between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2.
6. Finally, approach the goal from above.

Based on this analysis, here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Start point
    (3.0, 8.0),    # Move up to avoid Obstacle 2
    (6.0, 11.0),   # Navigate around the top of Obstacle 3
    (12.0, 11.0),  # Move right, staying above Obstacle 2
    (14.0, 13.0),  # Start moving towards the gap
    (16.0, 15.0),  # Navigate through the gap between Obstacle 1 and 2
    (17.0, 17.0),  # Move towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point in the goal set
]

Explanation of changes:
1. The path now moves upward early to avoid Obstacle 2.
2. It takes a wider berth around Obstacle 3 by going further north.
3. The path stays above Obstacle 2 as it moves eastward.
4. It then navigates through the gap between Obstacle 1 and the upper boundary of the space.
5. Finally, it approaches the goal from above, avoiding Obstacle 1.

This path should avoid all obstacles while maintaining a safe distance from them. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set as required.

[09/09/2024 07:48:40 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles.

Analysis and Thought Process:

1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issues are with intersections of Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 1.
3. We need to route the path around Obstacle 3 to the left, then around Obstacle 1 to the right.
4. Obstacle 2 is not directly in our path but we should be mindful of it.

Let's create a new path:

1. We'll start at (2.0, 2.0) as before.
2. To avoid Obstacle 3, we'll first move left to (1.0, 5.0).
3. Then we'll move up and right to (4.0, 9.0), which should clear Obstacle 3.
4. Next, we'll move to (11.0, 9.0) to pass below Obstacle 3.
5. From here, we need to navigate between Obstacles 1 and 2. We'll go to (14.0, 11.0).
6. To avoid Obstacle 1, we'll move right to (18.0, 11.0).
7. Finally, we'll move up to (19.0, 19.0) to reach the goal set.

New path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),
    (1.0, 5.0),
    (4.0, 9.0),
    (11.0, 9.0),
    (14.0, 11.0),
    (18.0, 11.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]

This path should avoid all obstacles:
- It starts by moving left and up to avoid Obstacle 3.
- It then moves right, staying below Obstacle 3.
- It passes between Obstacles 2 and 3.
- It then moves right to avoid Obstacle 1.
- Finally, it moves up to the goal set, staying to the right of Obstacle 1.

This path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles while efficiently moving from the start set to the goal set.

[09/09/2024 07:48:49 PM] Thank you for the feedback and the example. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting the start and end requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start position is correct, so we'll keep (2.0, 2.0) as our starting point.
2. The main issues are with segments 3 through 6, which intersect with Obstacles 1 and 2.
3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 2, which spans a large area in the lower part of the space.
4. There's a gap between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3 that we can utilize.
5. We also need to navigate around Obstacle 1 to reach the goal.

Proposed solution:
1. Start at (2.0, 2.0) in the start set.
2. Move towards the gap between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3.
3. Pass through this gap, staying clear of both obstacles.
4. Move upwards to avoid Obstacle 1.
5. Navigate around Obstacle 1 to reach the goal set.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Start point
    (3.0, 3.0),    # Move slightly up and right
    (6.0, 3.0),    # Move right towards the gap between Obstacle 2 and 3
    (7.0, 5.0),    # Pass through the gap, staying clear of Obstacle 2
    (12.0, 12.0),  # Move up and right, avoiding Obstacle 1
    (14.0, 15.0),  # Continue moving up and right
    (17.0, 15.0),  # Move right, staying above Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point in the goal set
]

Explanation:
- The path starts at (2.0, 2.0), which is within the start set.
- We move to (3.0, 3.0) and then (6.0, 3.0) to approach the gap between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3.
- The point (7.0, 5.0) allows us to pass safely through this gap.
- We then move diagonally to (12.0, 12.0) to avoid Obstacle 1.
- The points (14.0, 15.0) and (17.0, 15.0) help us navigate around the top of Obstacle 1.
- Finally, we reach (19.0, 19.0), which is within the goal set.

This path should avoid all obstacles while meeting the start and end requirements. The waypoints are chosen to provide clear paths between them that don't intersect with any obstacles.

[09/09/2024 07:49:00 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issues are with segments 4, 5, 6, and 7, which intersect with various obstacles.
3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 2 and 3 in the lower part of the space, and then navigate between Obstacle 1 and 3 to reach the goal.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Start at (2.0, 2.0) as before.
2. Move towards (3.0, 3.0) to gain some altitude.
3. Instead of going straight towards the obstacles, we'll move left to (1.0, 6.0) to avoid Obstacle 2.
4. From there, we can move right to (6.0, 8.0), staying above Obstacle 2.
5. Now we need to navigate between Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 1. We'll go to (13.0, 8.0), which is to the right of Obstacle 3.
6. From here, we'll move up to (13.0, 14.0) to be above Obstacle 1.
7. Next, we'll go right to (18.0, 14.0), which puts us in line with the goal area.
8. Finally, we'll move up to (19.0, 19.0) to end in the goal set.

New path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),
    (3.0, 3.0),
    (1.0, 6.0),
    (6.0, 8.0),
    (13.0, 8.0),
    (13.0, 14.0),
    (18.0, 14.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]

This path should avoid all obstacles by maintaining a safe distance from them. It starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and uses linear segments between waypoints to navigate around the obstacles. The path takes a wider route to ensure it doesn't intersect with any of the obstacles, especially in the problematic areas identified in the feedback.
