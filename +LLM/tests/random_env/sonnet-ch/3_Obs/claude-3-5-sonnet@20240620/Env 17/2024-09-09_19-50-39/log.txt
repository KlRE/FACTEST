# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.4, 11.1], [15.5, 8.9], [19.4, 8.8], [19.2, 9.6]]
			Obstacle 2: [[15.0, 13.4], [6.9, 5.2], [11.5, 5.9], [19.1, 11.6]]
			Obstacle 3: [[17.6, 19.8], [15.3, 19.1], [15.4, 11.6], [15.8, 6.7]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

[09/09/2024 07:50:47 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and propose a path that avoids obstacles while moving from the start set to the goal set.

Analysis:
1. The start position is a square from (0,0) to (2,2).
2. The goal position is a square from (18,18) to (20,20).
3. There are three obstacles to avoid:
   - Obstacle 1 is in the upper-right quadrant.
   - Obstacle 2 is a large diagonal obstacle in the center.
   - Obstacle 3 is a vertical obstacle on the right side.

Path Strategy:
1. Start from the upper-right corner of the start set to minimize distance.
2. Move diagonally up and right, staying below Obstacle 2.
3. Navigate around the left side of Obstacle 3.
4. Move upwards between Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 1.
5. Finally, approach the goal set from the left.

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Start at upper-right corner of start set
    (6.0, 5.0),    # Move diagonally up and right, staying below Obstacle 2
    (11.0, 6.0),   # Continue moving right, still below Obstacle 2
    (14.0, 7.0),   # Approach the gap between Obstacles 2 and 3
    (14.5, 11.0),  # Move upwards in the gap between Obstacles 2 and 3
    (15.0, 15.0),  # Continue upwards, now between Obstacles 1 and 3
    (16.5, 17.0),  # Move slightly right to prepare for goal approach
    (18.5, 18.5)   # End at the center of the goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set
2. Ends within the goal set
3. Avoids all obstacles with a safe margin
4. Uses linear segments between waypoints
5. Does not cross any obstacles

The path takes a relatively direct route while maintaining a safe distance from all obstacles, particularly navigating the challenging central area dominated by Obstacle 2 and the narrow passage created by Obstacles 1 and 3.

[09/09/2024 07:50:55 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issue is that the path intersects with Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3.
3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 2, which is the largest and most central obstacle.
4. There appears to be a gap between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3 that we can utilize.
5. We should aim to pass below Obstacle 2 and then move upwards between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Start at (2.0, 2.0) as before.
2. Move towards the gap below Obstacle 2, aiming for a point around (6.0, 4.0).
3. Continue moving right to pass below Obstacle 2, reaching a point around (12.0, 5.0).
4. Move upwards to pass between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3, aiming for (14.0, 10.0).
5. Continue moving up and slightly right to (16.0, 16.0), which should clear all obstacles.
6. Finally, move to the goal area at (18.5, 18.5).

Based on this analysis, here's the proposed new path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),
    (6.0, 4.0),
    (12.0, 5.0),
    (14.0, 10.0),
    (16.0, 16.0),
    (18.5, 18.5)
]

This path should:
1. Start in the correct start set.
2. Avoid intersecting with all obstacles by passing below Obstacle 2 and then between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3.
3. End in the correct goal set.
4. Provide enough clearance from obstacles to prevent touching them.

The path now takes a more southerly route initially to avoid Obstacle 2, then moves upwards through the gap between obstacles, and finally approaches the goal from the southwest. This should resolve the intersection issues while maintaining a relatively direct path to the goal.

[09/09/2024 07:51:05 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issues are with segments 3, 4, and 5, which intersect with obstacles 2 and 3.
3. Obstacle 2 is a large diagonal obstacle that we need to navigate around.
4. Obstacle 3 is a vertical obstacle near the goal that we need to avoid.
5. Obstacle 1 is near the top-right, which we should also keep in mind.

Let's adjust the path:

1. Keep (2.0, 2.0) as the starting point.
2. Keep (6.0, 4.0) as it's clear of obstacles.
3. Instead of going directly to (12.0, 5.0), we'll go around the bottom of Obstacle 2.
4. We'll then move upwards, staying to the left of Obstacle 3.
5. Finally, we'll approach the goal from the left, avoiding Obstacle 1.

    (2.0, 2.0),   # Start point (unchanged)
    (6.0, 4.0),   # Second point (unchanged)
    (6.5, 3.0),   # Move slightly right and down to prepare for obstacle avoidance
    (11.0, 3.0),  # Move right, staying under Obstacle 2
    (13.0, 5.0),  # Move up and right, clearing Obstacle 2
    (14.0, 8.0),  # Continue moving up, staying left of Obstacle 3
    (15.0, 14.0), # Move further up, still avoiding Obstacle 3
    (17.0, 17.0), # Approach the goal from the left, avoiding Obstacle 1
    (18.5, 18.5)  # End point in the goal set (unchanged)
]

This new path should avoid all obstacles while maintaining a safe distance from them. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set. The path now takes a more circuitous route to avoid the obstacles, particularly going under and around Obstacle 2, then up the left side of Obstacle 3, before approaching the goal from the left to avoid Obstacle 1.

[09/09/2024 07:51:14 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting the start and end requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issues are with segments 5 through 8, which intersect with Obstacles 2 and 3.
3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 2 and then navigate between Obstacles 1 and 3 to reach the goal.

Spatial analysis:
1. There's a gap between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2 that we can use to move upwards.
2. We can go around Obstacle 2 by moving to the left of it.
3. There's a narrow passage between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3 that we can use to reach the goal area.

Path adjustment thought process:
1. Keep the initial segments up to (11.0, 3.0) as they don't intersect with any obstacles.
2. Instead of moving directly towards (13.0, 5.0), we'll go further left to avoid Obstacle 2.
3. We'll then move upwards through the gap between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2.
4. After clearing Obstacle 2, we'll move right and then upwards through the passage between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3.
5. Finally, we'll approach the goal from the right side to avoid intersecting with Obstacle 3.

Based on this analysis, here's the proposed new path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),     # Start point (unchanged)
    (6.0, 4.0),     # Intermediate point (unchanged)
    (6.5, 3.0),     # Intermediate point (unchanged)
    (11.0, 3.0),    # Intermediate point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 6.0),     # Move left and up to avoid Obstacle 2
    (5.0, 12.0),    # Move up through the gap between Obstacle 1 and 2
    (14.0, 12.0),   # Move right, staying above Obstacle 2
    (14.0, 16.0),   # Move up through the passage between Obstacle 1 and 3
    (17.0, 16.0),   # Move right, staying below Obstacle 3's top edge
    (18.5, 18.5)    # End point in the goal set (unchanged)
]

This path should avoid all obstacles while maintaining the correct start and end points. It takes advantage of the gaps between obstacles to navigate safely to the goal.

[09/09/2024 07:51:22 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback on the previous path. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issues occur in the latter half of the path, particularly from point (5.0, 12.0) onwards.
3. We need to avoid Obstacle 2, which spans a large area diagonally across the space.
4. Obstacle 3 creates a vertical barrier on the right side of the space.
5. Obstacle 1 is positioned in the upper-right quadrant and needs to be circumvented.

Let's create a new path that addresses these issues:

1. We'll keep the initial segment of the path up to (5.0, 6.0) as it doesn't intersect with any obstacles.
2. From there, we'll move upwards to avoid Obstacle 2.
3. We'll then navigate around Obstacle 2 by moving to the right, staying below Obstacle 1.
4. To reach the goal, we'll move upwards between Obstacles 1 and 3, then curve towards the goal set.

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (6.0, 4.0),    # Intermediate point (unchanged)
    (6.5, 3.0),    # Intermediate point (unchanged)
    (11.0, 3.0),   # Intermediate point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 6.0),    # Intermediate point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 14.0),   # Move upwards to avoid Obstacle 2
    (13.0, 14.0),  # Move right, staying below Obstacle 1
    (14.5, 14.0),  # Continue moving right
    (14.5, 17.0),  # Move upwards between Obstacles 1 and 3
    (16.0, 17.0),  # Move slightly right
    (17.0, 18.0),  # Move towards the goal set
    (18.5, 18.5)   # End point in the goal set (unchanged)
]

This new path should address the previous issues:
1. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
2. It avoids Obstacle 2 by moving above it.
3. It navigates between Obstacles 1 and 3 to reach the goal.
4. The path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles to ensure no intersections occur.

This path provides a smoother and safer route to the goal while adhering to all the given constraints and requirements.

Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/09/2024 07:51:31 PM] Analyzing the feedback and the given obstacle positions, I realize that the main issue is with the final approach to the goal set. The path intersects with Obstacle 3, which extends vertically and blocks a direct approach from the west. Let's adjust the path to avoid this obstacle:

1. The path up to (14.5, 14.0) seems to be clear of obstacles, so we can keep that part.

2. Instead of moving directly east and then north, we need to curve around the northern edge of Obstacle 3.

3. We know that Obstacle 3's northernmost point is at y=19.8, so we need to go above this to safely pass.

4. After passing above Obstacle 3, we can then move south to enter the goal set.

Based on this analysis, here's the adjusted path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (6.0, 4.0),    # (unchanged)
    (6.5, 3.0),    # (unchanged)
    (11.0, 3.0),   # (unchanged)
    (5.0, 6.0),    # (unchanged)
    (5.0, 14.0),   # (unchanged)
    (13.0, 14.0),  # (unchanged)
    (14.5, 14.0),  # (unchanged)
    (14.5, 20.5),  # Move north, above Obstacle 3
    (18.0, 20.5),  # Move east, still above Obstacle 3
    (18.0, 19.0),  # Move south into the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Final point within the goal set
]

This new path should avoid all obstacles:
1. It maintains the initial part of the path which was already clear of obstacles.
2. Instead of trying to pass through the space between Obstacle 3 and the goal set (which was too narrow), it now goes above Obstacle 3 entirely.
3. The final approach to the goal set is from the north, avoiding the vertical barrier of Obstacle 3.
4. The last two points ensure we enter and end within the goal set quadrilateral.

This path should satisfy all the requirements: it starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, avoids all obstacles, and doesn't cross any obstacle boundaries.
