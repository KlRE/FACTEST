# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[12.2, 17.3], [17.5, 15.8], [17.9, 18.9], [14.6, 19.9]]
			Obstacle 2: [[8.0, 17.6], [15.0, 15.5], [16.8, 17.1], [16.0, 17.2]]
			Obstacle 3: [[13.0, 4.8], [16.7, 0.1], [19.3, 12.0], [14.7, 8.6]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/09/2024 07:50:31 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I've analyzed the environment and planned a path that meets the criteria. Here's my solution:

The path will start from the start set, navigate around the obstacles, and end in the goal set. I'll provide a brief explanation of the chosen waypoints and then present the path in the required format.

1. Start within the start set, choosing a point near the center.
2. Move diagonally up and right to avoid Obstacle 3.
3. Continue moving upwards, staying to the left of Obstacle 3.
4. Navigate between Obstacles 2 and 3.
5. Move towards the right, staying below Obstacle 2.
6. Navigate between Obstacles 1 and 2.
7. Move upwards and slightly right to reach the goal set.

Here's the path represented as an array of waypoints:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (5.0, 5.0),    # Move diagonally up and right
    (7.0, 10.0),   # Continue upwards, avoiding Obstacle 3
    (12.0, 14.0),  # Navigate between Obstacles 2 and 3
    (16.0, 14.5),  # Move right, staying below Obstacle 2
    (17.5, 15.0),  # Navigate between Obstacles 1 and 2
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set
]

This path successfully avoids all obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. The waypoints are chosen to maintain a safe distance from the obstacles and provide a smooth trajectory.
