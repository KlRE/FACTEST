# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[11.9, 17.8], [14.0, 11.0], [17.2, 12.7], [17.2, 15.9]]
			Obstacle 2: [[18.4, 15.5], [17.7, 18.8], [17.8, 16.6], [18.2, 15.7]]
			Obstacle 3: [[15.1, 19.1], [16.1, 15.1], [18.7, 16.8], [18.5, 17.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/09/2024 07:45:48 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and propose a path that avoids the obstacles while meeting the start and end conditions.

Analysis:
1. The start area is a 2x2 square in the bottom-left corner.
2. The goal area is a 2x2 square in the top-right corner.
3. There are three obstacles between the start and goal, forming a cluster in the upper-right quadrant of the space.
4. There's a clear path along the left and bottom sides of the space.

Path Strategy:
1. Start from the bottom-left corner of the start area.
2. Move upwards along the left side of the space.
3. Then move rightwards above all obstacles.
4. Finally, approach the goal area from above.

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point within the start area
    (1.0, 19.5),   # Move up along the left side
    (17.5, 19.5),  # Move right above all obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point within the goal area
]

Explanation:
1. (1.0, 1.0): This point is within the start area, avoiding the edges for safety.
2. (1.0, 19.5): Moving straight up, staying clear of the left boundary and well above all obstacles.
3. (17.5, 19.5): Moving right, staying above all obstacles. The y-coordinate of 19.5 ensures we're above the highest point of Obstacle 3 (19.1).
4. (19.0, 19.0): This final point is within the goal area, avoiding the edges for safety.

This path satisfies all requirements:
- It starts within the start set and ends within the goal set.
- It avoids all obstacles with a safe margin.
- The linear segments between waypoints do not intersect any obstacles.
- The path is simple and efficient, using only four waypoints.
