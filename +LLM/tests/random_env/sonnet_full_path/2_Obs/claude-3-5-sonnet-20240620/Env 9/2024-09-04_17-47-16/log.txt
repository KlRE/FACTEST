# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[19.8, 6.8], [15.8, 7.8], [16.2, 1.1], [18.9, 2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[17.7, 19.0], [5.6, 18.7], [7.5, 15.8], [15.0, 17.4]]

    
## Instructions

    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

## Example
### Provided Data

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate

[09/04/2024 05:47:18 PM] Based on the provided information, a possible path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids the obstacles could be:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0), # start point within the start set
    (10.0, 2.0), # move horizontally to the right
    (10.0, 18.0), # move vertically upwards
    (19.0, 18.0) # move horizontally to the right to end within the goal set
]

This path starts at (1.0, 2.0) within the start set and ends at (19.0, 18.0) within the goal set. It avoids the obstacles by first moving horizontally to the right, then vertically upwards, and finally horizontally to the right again. The path does not intersect with any of the provided obstacles.

Please note that this is not the only possible path that satisfies the requirements. There may be other valid solutions as well.

[09/04/2024 05:47:20 PM] Analyzing the provided path and the obstacles, I can see that the path intersects with Obstacle 2 in two segments:

1. The segment between (10.0, 2.0) and (10.0, 18.0) intersects with Obstacle 2.
2. The segment between (10.0, 18.0) and (19.0, 18.0) also intersects with Obstacle 2.

To avoid these intersections and create a valid path, I will need to modify the path to go around Obstacle 2.

Thought Process:
1. I will start by keeping the first waypoint (1.0, 2.0) as it is within the start set.
2. To avoid the first intersection, I will add a waypoint at (10.0, 6.0) to move the path above Obstacle 2.
3. Then, I will add a waypoint at (15.0, 18.0) to move the path around the right side of Obstacle 2.
4. Finally, I will add a waypoint at (19.0, 18.0) to end the path within the goal set.

New Path:
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0),
    (10.0, 6.0),
    (15.0, 18.0),
    (19.0, 18.0)
]

This new path starts within the start set, avoids both obstacles, and ends within the goal set. The linear segments connecting the waypoints do not intersect with any obstacles.

[09/04/2024 05:47:24 PM] Upon analyzing the provided path and the feedback, I can see that the path intersects with Obstacle 2. To avoid this, I will need to modify the path to ensure it does not cross any obstacles while still starting within the start set and ending within the goal set.

Here's my thought process and the steps I will take to generate a new valid path:

1. The start set is a quadrilateral defined by the coordinates [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]. I will choose a point within this quadrilateral as the starting point for the new path.

2. Obstacle 1 is defined by the coordinates [[19.8, 6.8], [15.8, 7.8], [16.2, 1.1], [18.9, 2.0]]. To avoid this obstacle, I will plan the path to pass to the left of it.

3. Obstacle 2 is defined by the coordinates [[17.7, 19.0], [5.6, 18.7], [7.5, 15.8], [15.0, 17.4]]. To avoid this obstacle, I will plan the path to pass above it.

4. The goal set is a quadrilateral defined by the coordinates [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]. I will choose a point within this quadrilateral as the end point for the new path.

5. The new path will consist of the following waypoints:
   - Start point: (1.0, 1.5) (within the start set)
   - Waypoint 1: (10.0, 6.0) (to the left of Obstacle 1)
   - Waypoint 2: (15.0, 17.0) (above Obstacle 2)
   - End point: (19.0, 19.0) (within the goal set)

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.5),
    (10.0, 6.0),
    (15.0, 17.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]

This new path starts within the start set, avoids both obstacles, and ends within the goal set. The linear segments connecting the waypoints do not cross any obstacles.
