# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[17.8, 20.0], [11.9, 14.6], [14.3, 13.0], [16.2, 14.5]]
			Obstacle 2: [[17.5, 19.5], [5.5, 19.3], [9.2, 12.8], [9.6, 12.6]]
			Obstacle 3: [[7.3, 15.4], [8.3, 8.2], [11.4, 15.9], [9.9, 18.1]]
			Obstacle 4: [[15.3, 19.5], [17.3, 16.6], [17.4, 16.6], [17.4, 19.3]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 3.96), (9.0, 20.68)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/09/2024 02:19:56 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll create a path that meets all the specified conditions. Let's analyze the environment and plan the path:

1. The start position is a quadrilateral near the origin, and we need to choose a point within it.
2. The goal position is a quadrilateral in the upper right corner.
3. There are four obstacles between the start and goal positions.
4. We need to pass through one of the breakpoints in the given set: (9.0, 3.96) or (9.0, 20.68).
5. The path should avoid all obstacles while maintaining a safe distance.

Considering these factors, here's a proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start set
    (3.0, 1.0),  # Move right to avoid obstacles
    (9.0, 3.96),  # Pass through the lower breakpoint
    (13.0, 8.0),  # Navigate between obstacles 2 and 3
    (16.0, 12.0),  # Move upwards avoiding obstacle 1
    (18.5, 16.0),  # Position to enter the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set
]

Explanation of the path:
1. We start at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start set.
2. We move right to (3.0, 1.0) to gain some distance from the obstacles.
3. We then move to (9.0, 3.96), which is one of the required breakpoints.
4. From there, we navigate to (13.0, 8.0), which helps us avoid obstacles 2 and 3.
5. We then move to (16.0, 12.0), staying clear of obstacle 1.
6. Next, we position ourselves at (18.5, 16.0) to prepare for entering the goal set.
7. Finally, we end at (19.0, 19.0), which is within the goal set.

This path avoids all obstacles while maintaining a safe distance, starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and passes through one of the required breakpoints. The waypoints are not always parallel to one axis, providing a more flexible and efficient path through the complex obstacle arrangement.
