# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[10.2, 0.1], [13.8, 4.6], [13.6, 9.2], [12.3, 6.1]]
			Obstacle 2: [[7.5, 17.2], [0.2, 15.8], [3.3, 15.7], [10.6, 16.2]]
			Obstacle 3: [[0.1, 10.1], [12.9, 14.7], [8.6, 17.9], [0.3, 15.5]]
			Obstacle 4: [[11.6, 2.1], [16.5, 11.8], [16.1, 13.2], [14.6, 12.8]]
			Obstacle 5: [[0.7, 9.1], [4.0, 4.3], [7.8, 9.2], [7.7, 12.1]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 5.64), (9.0, 19.8)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

[09/09/2024 02:41:47 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll create a path that meets all the specified criteria. Let's analyze the environment and plan the path:

1. The start position is in the bottom-left corner of the map.
2. The goal position is in the top-right corner of the map.
3. There are five obstacles scattered across the map.
4. We need to pass through one of the breakpoints in the set [(9.0, 5.64), (9.0, 19.8)].

After analyzing the layout, here's a suitable path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start within the start set
    (5.0, 3.0),     # Move diagonally to avoid Obstacle 1
    (9.0, 5.64),    # Pass through the lower breakpoint
    (14.0, 10.0),   # Navigate between Obstacles 1 and 4
    (17.0, 15.0),   # Move towards the goal, avoiding Obstacle 4
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End within the goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set at (1.0, 1.0).
2. Moves diagonally to (5.0, 3.0) to avoid Obstacle 1.
3. Passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 5.64) as required.
4. Navigates between Obstacles 1 and 4 by moving to (14.0, 10.0).
5. Continues towards the goal while avoiding Obstacle 4 by moving to (17.0, 15.0).
6. Ends within the goal set at (19.0, 19.0).

This path avoids all obstacles while maintaining a safe distance from them. It meets all the requirements by starting in the start set, ending in the goal set, passing through one of the required breakpoints, and using arbitrary waypoints that are not always parallel to one axis.

    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[09/09/2024 02:41:56 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids obstacles and meets all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The valid subpath [(1.0, 1.0), (5.0, 3.0), (9.0, 5.64)] doesn't intersect with any obstacles, so we can keep this part.
2. The segment from (9.0, 5.64) to (14.0, 10.0) intersects with Obstacle 4, so we need to adjust this part.
3. We need to ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints. We're already using (9.0, 5.64), which is good.
4. Looking at the obstacle layout, we can see a potential path between Obstacle 4 and Obstacle 2.

Path adjustment thought process:
1. Keep the first three waypoints as they are valid.
2. From (9.0, 5.64), we need to move upwards to avoid Obstacle 4.
3. We can then move towards the right, passing between Obstacle 4 and Obstacle 2.
4. Finally, we can approach the goal set from the left.

Here's the proposed new path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 3.0),    # Second point (unchanged)
    (9.0, 5.64),   # Breakpoint (unchanged)
    (11.0, 9.0),   # New point to avoid Obstacle 4
    (15.0, 14.0),  # New point passing between Obstacle 4 and Obstacle 2
    (17.0, 17.0),  # New point approaching the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point in the goal set
]

Explanation of the new path:
1. The first three points remain the same as they were valid.
2. The new point (11.0, 9.0) helps to avoid Obstacle 4 by moving upwards and slightly to the right.
3. (15.0, 14.0) allows the path to pass safely between Obstacle 4 and Obstacle 2.
4. (17.0, 17.0) is an intermediate point to approach the goal set.
5. (19.0, 19.0) is the end point, which lies within the goal set.

This path should satisfy all the requirements:
- It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
- It passes through one of the breakpoints (9.0, 5.64).
- It avoids all obstacles by maintaining a safe distance.
- The waypoints are not always parallel to one axis, providing more flexibility in avoiding obstacles.
