# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[16.9, 17.4], [16.0, 17.9], [16.1, 16.1], [16.7, 13.1]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 10.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

[09/09/2024 01:51:52 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I've analyzed the environment and created a path that meets the specified criteria. Here's my solution:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start within the start set
    (5.0, 5.0),     # Move diagonally up and right, avoiding the obstacle
    (9.0, 10.0),    # Pass through the required breakpoint
    (13.0, 14.0),   # Continue moving diagonally up and right
    (17.0, 18.0),   # Adjust course to avoid the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End within the goal set
]

Explanation:
1. The path starts at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start set.
2. It then moves diagonally up and right to (5.0, 5.0), staying clear of the obstacle.
3. The path passes through the required breakpoint at (9.0, 10.0).
4. It continues moving diagonally to (13.0, 14.0), maintaining a safe distance from the obstacle.
5. The path then adjusts course slightly to (17.0, 18.0) to ensure it avoids the obstacle near the goal.
6. Finally, it ends at (19.0, 19.0), which is within the goal set.

This path satisfies all the requirements:
- It starts within the start set and ends within the goal set.
- It passes through the required breakpoint (9.0, 10.0).
- It avoids the obstacle by maintaining a safe distance.
- The waypoints are arbitrary and not always parallel to one axis, allowing for diagonal movements.
- The path doesn't cross or touch any obstacles.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

[09/09/2024 01:52:00 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacle while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The current path intersects with Obstacle 1 between points (13.0, 14.0) and (17.0, 18.0).
2. We need to adjust the path to go around this obstacle while maintaining a safe distance.
3. The obstacle is positioned in the upper-right quadrant of the space, so we can try to go either above or below it.
4. Going above the obstacle seems more direct and allows us to maintain a smoother path towards the goal.
5. We'll keep the first three waypoints of the valid subpath and adjust from there.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Start from (1.0, 1.0) in the start set.
2. Keep the waypoints (5.0, 5.0) and (9.0, 10.0) as they are valid and include the required breakpoint.
3. From (9.0, 10.0), we'll adjust the path to go above the obstacle:
   - Add a new waypoint at (13.0, 15.0) to start moving upward.
   - Add another waypoint at (15.0, 18.0) to clear the top of the obstacle.
   - Add a point at (17.0, 19.0) to ensure we're past the obstacle before moving towards the goal.
4. Finally, end at (19.0, 19.0) in the goal set.

New proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (5.0, 5.0),
    (9.0, 10.0),
    (13.0, 15.0),
    (15.0, 18.0),
    (17.0, 19.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]

This new path should:
1. Start in the correct start set.
2. End in the correct goal set.
3. Pass through the required breakpoint (9.0, 10.0).
4. Avoid intersecting with the obstacle by going above it.
5. Maintain a safe distance from the obstacle.

The path now takes a slight detour upwards to avoid the obstacle while still maintaining a relatively direct route to the goal. This should satisfy all the requirements of the motion planning task.
