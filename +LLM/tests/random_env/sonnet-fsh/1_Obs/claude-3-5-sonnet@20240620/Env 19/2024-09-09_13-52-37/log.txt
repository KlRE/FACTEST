# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[17.4, 12.7], [11.2, 13.1], [16.4, 10.6], [19.1, 9.4]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 10.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

[09/09/2024 01:52:42 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I've analyzed the environment and designed a path that meets the specified criteria. Here's the path solution:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (5.0, 5.0),    # Move diagonally towards the goal, avoiding the obstacle
    (9.0, 10.0),   # Pass through the required breakpoint
    (15.0, 15.0),  # Continue moving towards the goal, maintaining distance from the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set
]

Explanation:
1. The path starts at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start set.
2. It then moves diagonally to (5.0, 5.0), which helps avoid the obstacle while making progress towards the goal.
3. The path passes through (9.0, 10.0), which is the required breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1.
4. It continues diagonally to (15.0, 15.0), maintaining a safe distance from the obstacle.
5. Finally, it ends at (19.0, 19.0), which is within the goal set.

This path successfully avoids the obstacle (Obstacle 1) by passing well below and to the left of it. The diagonal movements allow for efficient progress towards the goal while maintaining a safe distance from the obstacle. The path also satisfies all the requirements by starting in the start set, ending in the goal set, passing through the required breakpoint, and avoiding obstacles.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[09/09/2024 01:52:49 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacle while meeting all the requirements.

Chain of Thought:

1. The valid subpath ends at (9.0, 10.0), which is also the breakpoint we need to pass through. This is a good starting point for our new path.

2. The obstacle we need to avoid is located roughly between (11.2, 13.1) and (19.1, 9.4). We need to plan a route that goes around this obstacle.

3. Given the shape and position of the obstacle, it seems easier to go above it rather than below, as going below might make it harder to reach the goal set.

4. We'll add a waypoint to move upwards before moving towards the goal, ensuring we clear the top of the obstacle.

5. After clearing the obstacle, we can then move towards the goal set.

6. Finally, we'll end the path within the goal set quadrilateral.

Based on this analysis, here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start within the start set
    (5.0, 5.0),     # Intermediate point (unchanged)
    (9.0, 10.0),    # Breakpoint (unchanged)
    (11.0, 14.0),   # New point to move upwards and avoid the obstacle
    (16.0, 16.0),   # New point after clearing the obstacle, moving towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End within the goal set (unchanged)
]

This new path should satisfy all the requirements:
1. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
2. It passes through the required breakpoint (9.0, 10.0).
3. It avoids intersecting with the obstacle by going above it.
4. The waypoints are arbitrary and not always parallel to one axis.
5. The path should not cross or touch any obstacles.

This path provides a clear route from the start to the goal while satisfying all the given constraints and avoiding the obstacle.
