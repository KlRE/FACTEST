# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[16.9, 18.4], [14.0, 11.0], [17.5, 10.3], [18.7, 13.5]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 10.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

[09/09/2024 01:49:48 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll create a path that meets all the criteria. Let's analyze the environment:

1. The start area is a square from (0,0) to (2,2).
2. The goal area is a square from (18,18) to (20,20).
3. There's one obstacle between (14,10.3) and (18.7,18.4).
4. We need to pass through the breakpoint at (9,10).

Here's a suitable path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start area
    (5.0, 5.0),    # Move diagonally up and right
    (9.0, 10.0),   # Pass through the required breakpoint
    (13.0, 15.0),  # Move up and right, staying clear of the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal area
]

Explanation:
1. We start at (1,1), which is within the start area.
2. We move diagonally to (5,5) to get away from the start area.
3. We then move to (9,10), which is the required breakpoint.
4. From there, we move to (13,15), which keeps us clear of the obstacle.
5. Finally, we end at (19,19), which is within the goal area.

This path avoids the obstacle by passing well above its lower extent, and it meets all the requirements:
- It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
- It passes through the required breakpoint (9,10).
- It avoids the obstacle, keeping a safe distance.
- The waypoints are not always parallel to one axis, providing a more direct route.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[09/09/2024 01:49:56 PM] HTTP Request: POST https://europe-west1-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/gentle-keyword-432706-b3/locations/europe-west1/publishers/anthropic/models/claude-3-5-sonnet@20240620:rawPredict "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[09/09/2024 01:49:56 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacle while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct.
2. The path successfully passed through the required breakpoint (9.0, 10.0).
3. The issue occurs in the last segment, from (13.0, 15.0) to (19.0, 19.0), which intersects with Obstacle 1.

To correct this, we need to adjust the path to go around Obstacle 1. Let's analyze the spatial relationships:

1. Obstacle 1 is roughly positioned between y=10 and y=18, and x=14 and x=19.
2. There's more space above the obstacle than below it.
3. The goal set is at the top-right corner of the environment.

Based on this analysis, I propose we modify the path to go above Obstacle 1. Here's the thought process for the new path:

1. Keep the first three waypoints as they are valid: (1.0, 1.0), (5.0, 5.0), (9.0, 10.0).
2. From (9.0, 10.0), instead of going directly towards the goal, we'll first move upwards to clear the top of the obstacle.
3. Then we'll move rightwards, staying above the obstacle.
4. Finally, we'll move towards the goal set.

Here's the proposed new path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 5.0),    # Intermediate point (unchanged)
    (9.0, 10.0),   # Breakpoint (unchanged)
    (12.0, 19.0),  # Move upwards to clear the top of the obstacle
    (18.0, 19.0),  # Move rightwards, staying above the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point in the goal set
]

This path should satisfy all the requirements:
1. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
2. It passes through the required breakpoint (9.0, 10.0).
3. It avoids intersecting with Obstacle 1 by going above it.
4. The linear segments between waypoints should not cross any obstacles.

This solution provides a clear path around the obstacle while maintaining efficiency in reaching the goal. The extra waypoints added ensure that the path remains a safe distance from the obstacle edges.
