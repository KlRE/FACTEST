# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[16.5, 17.7], [13.3, 16.2], [16.5, 8.4], [17.1, 8.6]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 10.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response

[09/09/2024 01:47:54 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I've analyzed the environment and come up with a path that meets the criteria. Here's my solution:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start within the start set
    (3.0, 3.0),      # Move diagonally to avoid the obstacle
    (9.0, 10.0),     # Pass through the required breakpoint
    (12.0, 12.0),    # Continue moving diagonally
    (17.5, 17.5),    # Approach the goal while avoiding the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)     # End within the goal set
]

Explanation:
1. The path starts at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start set.
2. It then moves diagonally to (3.0, 3.0) to start avoiding the obstacle.
3. The path passes through (9.0, 10.0), which is the required breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1.
4. It continues diagonally to (12.0, 12.0), maintaining a safe distance from the obstacle.
5. The path then moves to (17.5, 17.5), carefully avoiding the obstacle (Obstacle 1) which is located around the (13.3, 16.2) to (17.1, 8.6) area.
6. Finally, it ends at (19.0, 19.0), which is within the goal set.

This path satisfies all the requirements:
- It starts within the start set and ends within the goal set.
- It passes through the required breakpoint (9.0, 10.0).
- It avoids the obstacle by maintaining a safe distance.
- The waypoints are arbitrary and not always parallel to one axis, providing a smooth and efficient path.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[09/09/2024 01:48:04 PM] Thank you for the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacle while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the current path are correct, so we can keep those.
2. The path correctly passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 10.0), which we should maintain.
3. The issue occurs between points (12.0, 12.0) and (17.5, 17.5), where the path intersects with Obstacle 1.
4. We need to adjust the path to go around Obstacle 1 while maintaining a safe distance.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Keep the start point (1.0, 1.0) and the next two waypoints, as they are valid.
2. From (12.0, 12.0), we need to avoid Obstacle 1. Looking at the obstacle's coordinates, we can see it's oriented diagonally.
3. To avoid the obstacle, we'll go around its left side, keeping a safe distance.
4. After passing the obstacle, we can then move towards the goal set.

Here's the proposed new path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start point (unchanged)
    (3.0, 3.0),     # Second point (unchanged)
    (9.0, 10.0),    # Breakpoint (unchanged)
    (12.0, 12.0),   # Last valid point before obstacle (unchanged)
    (12.5, 15.0),   # New point to start avoiding the obstacle
    (13.0, 17.0),   # New point to continue avoiding the obstacle
    (15.0, 18.0),   # New point after passing the obstacle
    (17.5, 18.5),   # New point approaching the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End point in the goal set (unchanged)
]

Explanation of the new waypoints:
- (12.5, 15.0) and (13.0, 17.0): These points help the path curve around the left side of Obstacle 1, maintaining a safe distance.
- (15.0, 18.0): This point ensures we've cleared the obstacle before moving towards the goal.
- (17.5, 18.5): This point helps approach the goal set from a safe angle.

This new path should avoid intersecting with Obstacle 1 while still meeting all the requirements:
1. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
2. It passes through the required breakpoint (9.0, 10.0).
3. It avoids intersecting with the obstacle by going around its left side.
4. The path is represented as an array of waypoints that can be linearly connected.
