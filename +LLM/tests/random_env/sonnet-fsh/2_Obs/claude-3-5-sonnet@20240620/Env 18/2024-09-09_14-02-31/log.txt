# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[11.4, 18.3], [10.0, 15.9], [10.3, 15.8], [11.8, 16.9]]
			Obstacle 2: [[4.8, 9.5], [9.0, 0.3], [10.5, 0.8], [7.3, 9.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, -0.85), (9.0, 13.32)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]

    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]

[09/09/2024 02:02:37 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I've analyzed the environment and come up with a path that meets the specified criteria. Here's the path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start within the start set
    (4.0, 1.0),     # Move right to avoid Obstacle 2
    (9.0, -0.85),   # Move to the breakpoint from Set 1, avoiding Obstacle 2
    (9.0, 13.32),   # Move up to the other breakpoint from Set 1
    (12.5, 17.5),   # Move diagonally to avoid Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End within the goal set
]

Explanation:
1. The path starts at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start set.
2. It then moves right to (4.0, 1.0) to avoid Obstacle 2.
3. The path continues to (9.0, -0.85), which is one of the breakpoints from Set 1. This point is chosen to maintain a safe distance from Obstacle 2.
4. It then moves vertically to (9.0, 13.32), which is the other breakpoint from Set 1.
5. To avoid Obstacle 1, the path moves diagonally to (12.5, 17.5).
6. Finally, it ends at (19.0, 19.0), which is within the goal set.

This path satisfies all the requirements:
- It starts within the start set and ends within the goal set.
- It passes through both breakpoints from Set 1.
- It avoids all obstacles with a safe margin.
- The waypoints are not always parallel to one axis, allowing for more flexible movement.
- The linear segments connecting these waypoints do not intersect with any obstacles.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[09/09/2024 02:02:46 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct.
2. The path correctly passed through both breakpoints (9.0, -0.85) and (9.0, 13.32).
3. The main issue was the intersection with Obstacle 2 between the two breakpoints.

Spatial analysis:
1. Obstacle 2 is positioned diagonally from bottom-left to top-right, blocking a direct path between the breakpoints.
2. There's space to the left of Obstacle 2 that can be utilized to go around it.
3. Obstacle 1 is positioned in the upper-right quadrant, which needs to be considered when approaching the goal.

Path adjustment strategy:
1. Keep the start point and the first two waypoints as they are valid.
2. From (9.0, -0.85), we need to go around Obstacle 2 from the left side.
3. After passing Obstacle 2, we can proceed to the second breakpoint (9.0, 13.32).
4. From there, we need to carefully navigate around Obstacle 1 to reach the goal.

New path proposal:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start point (unchanged)
    (4.0, 1.0),      # First waypoint (unchanged)
    (9.0, -0.85),    # First breakpoint (unchanged)
    (4.0, 4.0),      # New point to go around Obstacle 2 from the left
    (4.0, 10.0),     # New point to clear Obstacle 2
    (9.0, 13.32),    # Second breakpoint
    (12.0, 15.0),    # New point to navigate around Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 19.0)     # End point in the goal set (unchanged)
]

Explanation of new waypoints:
1. (4.0, 4.0): This point helps us avoid Obstacle 2 by going to its left side.
2. (4.0, 10.0): This point ensures we've cleared Obstacle 2 before moving towards the second breakpoint.
3. (12.0, 15.0): This point helps us navigate around Obstacle 1 as we approach the goal.

This new path should satisfy all requirements:
1. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
2. It passes through both breakpoints.
3. It avoids intersecting with both obstacles by maintaining a safe distance.
4. The waypoints are not always parallel to one axis, providing a more flexible path.
