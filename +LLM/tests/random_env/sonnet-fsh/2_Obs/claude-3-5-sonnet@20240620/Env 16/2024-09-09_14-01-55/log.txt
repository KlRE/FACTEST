# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[7.7, 13.5], [0.2, 3.8], [11.7, 3.4], [14.6, 10.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.2, 20.0], [5.8, 15.8], [10.1, 17.5], [4.1, 19.6]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 0.75), (9.0, 14.95), (9.0, 19.94)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/09/2024 02:02:02 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I've analyzed the environment and come up with a path that satisfies the given constraints. Here's my reasoning and the resulting path:

1. We need to start within the start set (0,0) to (2,2).
2. We must pass through one of the breakpoints in Set 1: (9.0, 0.75), (9.0, 14.95), or (9.0, 19.94).
3. We need to avoid the two obstacles:
   - Obstacle 1 is roughly in the middle of the space.
   - Obstacle 2 is in the upper-left corner.
4. We need to end within the goal set (18,18) to (20,20).

Given these constraints, here's the path I propose:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 0.75),    # Pass through the lowest breakpoint to avoid Obstacle 1
    (15.0, 5.0),    # Move up and right to avoid Obstacle 1
    (16.0, 16.0),   # Continue moving up and right, staying clear of both obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End within the goal set
]

Reasoning:
1. We start at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start set.
2. We then move to (9.0, 0.75), which is one of the required breakpoints and helps us avoid Obstacle 1 by going under it.
3. The next point (15.0, 5.0) allows us to move up and right, staying clear of Obstacle 1.
4. We then move to (16.0, 16.0), which keeps us away from both obstacles and sets us up to reach the goal.
5. Finally, we end at (19.0, 19.0), which is within the goal set.

This path satisfies all the requirements:
- It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
- It passes through one of the required breakpoints.
- It avoids both obstacles with a safe margin.
- The waypoints are arbitrary and not always parallel to one axis.
- The linear segments between waypoints do not cross any obstacles.
