# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[17.2, 15.9], [19.5, 11.3], [19.3, 13.7], [17.4, 18.1]]
			Obstacle 2: [[17.2, 13.6], [11.8, 3.6], [17.3, 2.0], [19.7, 2.7]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 10.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

[09/09/2024 01:57:55 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll create a path that meets all the specified criteria. Let's analyze the environment first:

1. The start position is a square from (0,0) to (2,2).
2. The goal position is a square from (18,18) to (20,20).
3. There are two obstacles to avoid:
   - Obstacle 1 is roughly between y=11 and y=18, and x=17 to x=19.5
   - Obstacle 2 extends from about y=2 to y=13.6, and x=11.8 to x=19.7
4. There's one breakpoint at (9,10) that the path must pass through.

Considering these factors, here's a suitable path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start within the start set
    (5.0, 5.0),     # Move diagonally up and right
    (9.0, 10.0),    # Pass through the required breakpoint
    (15.0, 15.0),   # Move diagonally up and right, staying clear of obstacles
    (17.0, 17.0),   # Approach the goal while avoiding Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End within the goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set at (1,1).
2. Moves diagonally up and right, staying clear of both obstacles.
3. Passes through the required breakpoint at (9,10).
4. Continues moving up and right, maintaining a safe distance from both obstacles.
5. Approaches the goal from the bottom left, avoiding Obstacle 1.
6. Ends within the goal set at (19,19).

The path uses arbitrary waypoints that are not always parallel to one axis, as requested. It avoids both obstacles by maintaining a safe distance, does not cross any obstacles, starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and passes through the required breakpoint.

[09/09/2024 01:58:02 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Chain of Thought:
1. The current path intersects with Obstacle 1 in its final segment. We need to adjust the path to avoid this.
2. Looking at the obstacles' positions, there's a clear path between them that we can utilize.
3. We should maintain the valid subpath up to (17.0, 17.0) and then adjust the final segment to reach the goal set without intersecting the obstacle.
4. The breakpoint at (9.0, 10.0) is already included in the valid subpath, so we don't need to modify that part.

Path Analysis and Adjustments:
1. The path from (1.0, 1.0) to (17.0, 17.0) is valid and doesn't intersect any obstacles.
2. To avoid Obstacle 1, we need to move around it. We can do this by adding an additional waypoint.
3. Looking at Obstacle 1's coordinates, we can see that moving to a point like (18.0, 17.5) would allow us to bypass the obstacle.
4. From there, we can safely move to a point within the goal set, such as (19.0, 19.0).

Based on this analysis, here's the proposed new path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (5.0, 5.0),
    (9.0, 10.0),
    (15.0, 15.0),
    (17.0, 17.0),
    (18.0, 17.5),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]

This new path:
1. Starts in the start set
2. Passes through the required breakpoint (9.0, 10.0)
3. Avoids intersecting with Obstacle 1 by adding a waypoint at (18.0, 17.5)
4. Ends in the goal set
5. Maintains a safe distance from all obstacles

The addition of the waypoint at (18.0, 17.5) allows the path to curve around Obstacle 1 without intersecting it, while still reaching the goal set. This solution maintains the majority of the original path while solving the intersection problem in the final segment.

[09/09/2024 01:58:18 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The valid subpath ends at (17.0, 17.0), which is close to both Obstacle 1 and the goal set.
2. The segment between (17.0, 17.0) and (18.0, 17.5) intersects with Obstacle 1.
3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 1 to reach the goal set.
4. The breakpoint at (9.0, 10.0) is already included in the valid subpath, so we don't need to modify that part.

Path Adjustment Strategy:
1. Keep the valid subpath up to (17.0, 17.0).
2. Add waypoints to navigate around Obstacle 1.
3. Ensure the final waypoint is within the goal set.

New Path Proposal:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 5.0),    # Intermediate point (unchanged)
    (9.0, 10.0),   # Breakpoint (unchanged)

Explanation:
1. The path starts at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start set.
2. It maintains the valid subpath up to (17.0, 17.0).
3. From (17.0, 17.0), instead of moving directly towards the goal, we first move up to (16.5, 18.5). This point is chosen to be above Obstacle 1's top edge (18.1 at its highest point) with some margin for safety.
4. Then, we move right to (18.5, 18.5), staying above Obstacle 1 and avoiding any potential intersection.
5. Finally, we move to (19.0, 19.0), which is within the goal set (18.0 ≤ x ≤ 20.0 and 18.0 ≤ y ≤ 20.0).

This new path should avoid intersecting with both obstacles while meeting all the requirements, including starting in the start set, ending in the goal set, and passing through the required breakpoint.
