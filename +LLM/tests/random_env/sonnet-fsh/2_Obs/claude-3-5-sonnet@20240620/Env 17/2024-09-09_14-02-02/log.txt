# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[14.3, 7.4], [17.4, 18.2], [15.8, 18.2], [15.6, 17.2]]
			Obstacle 2: [[12.7, 17.6], [8.1, 12.9], [10.3, 10.6], [12.2, 14.2]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 4.97), (9.0, 17.9)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/09/2024 02:02:23 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and propose a path that meets all the criteria.

Analysis:
1. The start position is a square from (0,0) to (2,2).
2. The goal position is a square from (18,18) to (20,20).
3. There are two obstacles to avoid:
   - Obstacle 1 is roughly triangular, extending from about (14,7) to (17,18).
   - Obstacle 2 is an irregular quadrilateral between (8,11) and (13,18).
4. There's one breakpoint set: [(9.0, 4.97), (9.0, 17.9)]
5. We need to pass through one of these breakpoints.

Path planning:
1. Start from the start set, choosing a point near the top right corner.
2. Move towards the lower breakpoint (9.0, 4.97) to satisfy the breakpoint requirement.
3. Navigate around the obstacles by moving upwards and then rightwards.
4. Finally, approach the goal set from the bottom left.

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.8, 1.8),    # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 4.97),   # Pass through the lower breakpoint
    (9.0, 8.0),    # Move upwards to avoid Obstacle 2
    (13.0, 8.0),   # Move right, staying below Obstacle 2
    (13.0, 16.0),  # Move up, staying to the left of Obstacle 1
    (18.5, 16.0),  # Move right, above both obstacles
    (18.5, 18.5)   # End within the goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set
2. Ends within the goal set
3. Passes through one of the required breakpoints (9.0, 4.97)
4. Avoids both obstacles with a safe margin
5. Uses arbitrary waypoints that aren't always parallel to an axis
6. Doesn't cross any obstacles

The path takes a somewhat circuitous route to ensure it meets all requirements and maintains a safe distance from the obstacles.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

[09/09/2024 02:02:31 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The current path intersects with Obstacle 1 between points (13.0, 16.0) and (18.5, 16.0).
2. We need to adjust the path to go around Obstacle 1 while still reaching the goal set.
3. The breakpoint (9.0, 4.97) is already included in the path, which is good.
4. We need to maintain a safe distance from the obstacles.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Keep the starting point (1.8, 1.8) and the first breakpoint (9.0, 4.97) as they are valid.
2. Instead of going straight up to (9.0, 8.0), we'll move diagonally to avoid getting too close to Obstacle 2.
3. We'll then move towards the right side of Obstacle 1, maintaining a safe distance.
4. After passing Obstacle 1, we'll move upwards and then left towards the goal set.
5. Finally, we'll enter the goal set from the right side.

Here's the proposed new path:

new_path = [
    (1.8, 1.8),    # Start point
    (9.0, 4.97),   # Breakpoint
    (11.0, 7.0),   # Diagonal move to avoid Obstacle 2
    (17.8, 7.0),   # Move right, staying below Obstacle 1
    (17.8, 19.0),  # Move up, passing to the right of Obstacle 1
    (18.5, 19.0),  # Move slightly left to approach the goal set
    (18.5, 18.5)   # End point inside the goal set
]

This path should:
1. Start in the correct start set
2. End in the correct goal set
3. Pass through the required breakpoint (9.0, 4.97)
4. Avoid intersecting with both obstacles
5. Maintain a safe distance from the obstacles

The path now goes around Obstacle 1 on its right side and stays clear of Obstacle 2. It takes a slightly longer route but ensures obstacle avoidance while meeting all the requirements.
