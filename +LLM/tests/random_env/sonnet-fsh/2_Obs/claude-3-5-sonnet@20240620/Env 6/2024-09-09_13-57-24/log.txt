# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[5.2, 6.1], [14.0, 9.4], [10.9, 12.2], [9.7, 11.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[15.7, 7.5], [17.8, 0.1], [18.1, 10.5], [16.2, 14.8]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 2.76), (9.0, 16.45)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]

    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/09/2024 01:57:32 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll create a path that meets all the specified criteria. Let's analyze the environment and plan the path:

1. The start position is within the quadrilateral [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]].
2. The goal position is within the quadrilateral [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]].
3. There are two obstacles to avoid.
4. We need to pass through one of the breakpoints in the set [(9.0, 2.76), (9.0, 16.45)].

Analyzing the obstacles and breakpoints:
- Obstacle 1 is roughly in the middle-left of the space.
- Obstacle 2 is on the right side, extending vertically.
- The breakpoints are both at x=9.0, with one below Obstacle 1 and one above it.

Path planning:
1. Start from a point within the start set.
2. Move towards the lower breakpoint (9.0, 2.76) to satisfy the breakpoint requirement.
3. Navigate around Obstacle 1 by moving upwards.
4. Move towards the goal while avoiding Obstacle 2.
5. End at a point within the goal set.

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 2.76),    # Move to the lower breakpoint
    (9.0, 13.0),    # Move upwards to avoid Obstacle 1
    (15.0, 15.0),   # Move diagonally towards the goal, avoiding Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End within the goal set
]

This path:
- Starts within the start set
- Ends within the goal set
- Passes through one of the required breakpoints (9.0, 2.76)
- Avoids both obstacles by maintaining a safe distance
- Uses arbitrary waypoints that are not always parallel to one axis
- Doesn't cross any obstacles

The path first moves to the lower breakpoint, then goes upward to avoid Obstacle 1. It then moves diagonally towards the goal area, staying clear of Obstacle 2. Finally, it enters the goal set from the bottom-left corner.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[09/09/2024 01:57:41 PM] HTTP Request: POST https://europe-west1-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/gentle-keyword-432706-b3/locations/europe-west1/publishers/anthropic/models/claude-3-5-sonnet@20240620:rawPredict "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[09/09/2024 01:57:41 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct.
2. The path correctly passed through the breakpoint (9.0, 2.76) from Breakpoint Set 1.
3. The issue occurs with the segment from (9.0, 2.76) to (9.0, 13.0), which intersects with Obstacle 1.

Let's adjust the path to avoid Obstacle 1:

1. We'll keep the first two waypoints: (1.0, 1.0) and (9.0, 2.76), as they are valid.
2. Instead of going straight up to (9.0, 13.0), we'll go around Obstacle 1 to the left.
3. We need to be careful not to get too close to Obstacle 2 while doing this.
4. After passing Obstacle 1, we can move towards the goal.

Here's the new proposed path with explanations:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start point within the start set
    (9.0, 2.76),    # Breakpoint from Set 1
    (4.5, 5.5),     # Move left and up to avoid Obstacle 1
    (4.5, 13.0),    # Move up, staying clear of Obstacle 1
    (15.0, 15.0),   # Move diagonally towards the goal, avoiding Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End point within the goal set
]

Explanation of the new waypoints:
1. (4.5, 5.5): This point is chosen to be left of Obstacle 1's leftmost point (5.2, 6.1) and below its lowest point. This ensures we avoid the obstacle.
2. (4.5, 13.0): We move straight up, staying clear of Obstacle 1's extent.
3. (15.0, 15.0): This point is chosen to be above and to the right of Obstacle 1, while also being left of Obstacle 2's leftmost extent.

This path should now avoid both obstacles while still meeting all the requirements:
- It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
- It passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 2.76) from Breakpoint Set 1.
- It avoids intersecting with both obstacles.
- The waypoints are not always parallel to one axis, allowing for more flexible movement.

This path should resolve the issue of intersecting with Obstacle 1 while maintaining all other requirements.
