# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[7.7, 14.8], [15.5, 14.0], [12.7, 17.4], [8.3, 16.5]]
			Obstacle 2: [[12.9, 19.1], [11.1, 17.5], [12.5, 15.3], [15.8, 15.5]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 6.33), (9.0, 19.32)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]

    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/09/2024 01:52:58 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll create a path that meets all the criteria. Let's analyze the environment and plan the path:

1. The start position is within the quadrilateral [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]].
2. The goal position is within the quadrilateral [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]].
3. There are two obstacles to avoid.
4. We need to pass through one of the breakpoints in the set [(9.0, 6.33), (9.0, 19.32)].

Analyzing the layout:
- The obstacles are positioned in the upper-right quadrant of the space.
- There's a clear path from the start to the breakpoint at (9.0, 6.33).
- From this breakpoint, we can navigate around the obstacles to reach the goal.

Here's a suitable path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start within the start set
    (5.0, 3.0),     # Move diagonally up and right
    (9.0, 6.33),    # Reach the first breakpoint
    (7.0, 10.0),    # Move up to prepare for obstacle avoidance
    (6.0, 15.0),    # Navigate around the left side of Obstacle 1
    (10.0, 18.0),   # Move right, staying below Obstacle 2
    (16.0, 17.0),   # Navigate around the right side of Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End within the goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set at (1.0, 1.0).
2. Passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 6.33).
3. Avoids both obstacles by navigating around them.
4. Ends within the goal set at (19.0, 19.0).
5. Uses arbitrary waypoints that are not always parallel to one axis.
6. Maintains a safe distance from obstacles to ensure no crossing or touching.

The path takes a route that first reaches the lower breakpoint, then moves upward to navigate around the left side of Obstacle 1, proceeds between the two obstacles, and finally moves around the right side of Obstacle 2 to reach the goal. This approach ensures a clear and safe path that meets all the specified requirements.

		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[09/09/2024 01:53:23 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and suggest a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis and Thought Process:
1. The valid subpath ends at (10.0, 18.0), which is close to Obstacle 2.
2. The segment from (10.0, 18.0) to (16.0, 17.0) intersects with Obstacle 2, so we need to find a way around it.
3. We can go above Obstacle 2 to reach the goal set, as there seems to be enough space between Obstacle 2 and the upper boundary.
4. We still need to ensure we're not too close to Obstacle 1 when moving upwards.
5. After passing above Obstacle 2, we can move towards the goal set.
6. The path already includes the breakpoint (9.0, 6.33) from Breakpoint Set 1, so we don't need to adjust for that.

Based on this analysis, I'll suggest a new path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 3.0),     # Second point (unchanged)
    (9.0, 6.33),    # Breakpoint (unchanged)
    (7.0, 10.0),    # Fourth point (unchanged)
    (6.0, 15.0),    # Fifth point (unchanged)
    (10.0, 18.0),   # Sixth point (unchanged)
    (11.0, 19.5),   # New point to move above Obstacle 2
    (16.0, 19.5),   # New point to clear Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End point in the goal set
]

Explanation of changes:
1. I kept the valid subpath up to (10.0, 18.0).
2. From (10.0, 18.0), I added a new point (11.0, 19.5) to move upwards and slightly to the right, avoiding Obstacle 2.
3. Then, I added another point (16.0, 19.5) to move horizontally, staying above Obstacle 2.
4. Finally, I slightly adjusted the end point to (19.0, 19.0) to ensure it's within the goal set.

This new path should avoid both obstacles while still starting in the start set, ending in the goal set, and passing through the required breakpoint. The path takes a higher route around Obstacle 2, which should prevent any intersections with the obstacles.
