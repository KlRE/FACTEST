# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[0.9, 18.5], [-0.0, 7.5], [5.8, 10.7], [9.8, 18.1]]
			Obstacle 2: [[13.0, 18.2], [6.8, 15.3], [8.9, 15.2], [11.7, 16.1]]
			Obstacle 3: [[12.5, 8.3], [15.3, 5.5], [15.7, 14.9], [14.9, 16.1]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 6.62), (9.0, 16.47), (9.0, 20.06)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]

[09/09/2024 02:05:58 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I've analyzed the environment and come up with a path that meets the specified criteria. Here's the path represented as an array of waypoints:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start within the start set
    (5.0, 5.0),     # Move diagonally to avoid Obstacle 1
    (9.0, 6.62),    # Pass through a breakpoint from Set 1
    (12.0, 11.0),   # Navigate between Obstacles 2 and 3
    (16.0, 16.0),   # Move towards the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End within the goal set
]

Explanation:
1. The path starts at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start set.
2. It then moves diagonally to (5.0, 5.0) to avoid Obstacle 1.
3. The path passes through (9.0, 6.62), which is a breakpoint from Set 1.
4. It then navigates between Obstacles 2 and 3 by moving to (12.0, 11.0).
5. The path continues towards the goal set by moving to (16.0, 16.0).
6. Finally, it ends at (19.0, 19.0), which is within the goal set.

This path satisfies all the requirements:
- It starts within the start set and ends within the goal set.
- It passes through one of the breakpoints (9.0, 6.62) from the given set.
- The path avoids all obstacles, maintaining a safe distance from them.
- The waypoints are arbitrary and not always parallel to one axis, allowing for more flexible navigation.

The linear segments between these waypoints do not intersect with any of the obstacles, ensuring a safe path through the environment.

    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[09/09/2024 02:06:06 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids obstacles and meets all the requirements.

Chain of Thought:

1. The current path is valid up to the point (12.0, 11.0). We need to adjust the path from this point onwards.

2. The main issue is that the segment from (12.0, 11.0) to (16.0, 16.0) intersects with Obstacle 3.

3. Looking at Obstacle 3's shape, it appears to block a direct path to the goal. We need to find a way around it.

4. There seems to be a gap between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3 that we can utilize.

5. We should aim to pass through one of the breakpoints. The breakpoint at (9.0, 6.62) is already included in our valid subpath, so we've satisfied that requirement.

6. To avoid Obstacle 3, we can first move slightly to the left and then upwards, passing through the gap between Obstacles 2 and 3.

7. After clearing the obstacles, we can then move towards the goal set.

Based on this analysis, here's a new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 5.0),     # Intermediate point (unchanged)
    (9.0, 6.62),    # Breakpoint (unchanged)
    (12.0, 11.0),   # Last valid point from previous path
    (11.5, 13.0),   # Move slightly left and up to avoid Obstacle 3
    (13.0, 17.0),   # Move through the gap between Obstacles 2 and 3
    (16.0, 18.5),   # Move towards the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End point in the goal set
]

This new path should:
1. Start in the correct start set
2. End in the correct goal set
3. Avoid all obstacles
4. Pass through the required breakpoint (9.0, 6.62)
5. Use arbitrary waypoints that are not always parallel to one axis

The path now takes a slight detour to the left before moving upwards to avoid Obstacle 3, then passes through the gap between Obstacles 2 and 3 before heading towards the goal set. This should resolve the intersection issue while maintaining all other requirements.
