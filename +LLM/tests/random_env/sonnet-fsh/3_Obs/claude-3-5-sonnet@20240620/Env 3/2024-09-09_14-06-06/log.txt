# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.6, 10.8], [14.3, 14.0], [7.3, 14.8], [3.6, 12.7]]
			Obstacle 2: [[19.0, 8.6], [15.5, 5.1], [16.1, 0.6], [17.6, 4.4]]
			Obstacle 3: [[6.2, 13.5], [16.3, 10.7], [19.1, 16.7], [6.8, 14.2]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 5.33), (9.0, 18.32)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[09/09/2024 02:06:28 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and propose a path that meets all the criteria.

Analysis:
1. The start area is in the bottom-left corner (0,0 to 2,2).
2. The goal area is in the top-right corner (18,18 to 20,20).
3. There are three obstacles forming a rough diagonal barrier from bottom-right to top-left.
4. We need to pass through one of the breakpoints: (9.0, 5.33) or (9.0, 18.32).
5. The path should avoid obstacles with some margin for safety.

Path Strategy:
1. Start from the top-right corner of the start area.
2. Move towards the lower breakpoint (9.0, 5.33) to pass under the obstacles.
3. Navigate around the right side of Obstacle 2.
4. Move towards the goal area, avoiding Obstacle 3.
5. Enter the goal area from the bottom-left corner.

Proposed Path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),      # Start point
    (5.5, 3.5),      # Move towards the breakpoint while avoiding Obstacle 1
    (9.0, 5.33),     # Pass through the required breakpoint
    (14.0, 4.0),     # Navigate around the right side of Obstacle 2
    (17.0, 7.0),     # Move upwards while avoiding Obstacle 2
    (18.0, 12.0),    # Continue moving up, staying clear of Obstacle 3
    (19.0, 18.0)     # Enter the goal area
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set at (2.0, 2.0).
2. Ends within the goal set at (19.0, 18.0).
3. Passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 5.33).
4. Avoids all obstacles with a safety margin.
5. Uses arbitrary waypoints that are not always parallel to one axis.
6. Consists of linearly connected segments that do not cross any obstacles.

The path navigates under the main cluster of obstacles, utilizing the lower breakpoint to safely pass through the required area. It then curves around the right side of Obstacle 2 before moving upwards towards the goal, maintaining a safe distance from all obstacles throughout its trajectory.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

[09/09/2024 02:06:37 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The path was valid until the point (18.0, 12.0).
2. The last segment from (18.0, 12.0) to (19.0, 18.0) intersects with Obstacle 3.
3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 3 to reach the goal set.
4. The breakpoint (9.0, 5.33) is already included in the valid part of the path.

Thought process for the new path:
1. We'll keep the valid part of the path up to (18.0, 12.0).
2. To avoid Obstacle 3, we need to go around its right side, as going left would lead us into Obstacle 1.
3. We'll add a point to the right of Obstacle 3, then move upwards to clear it.
4. Finally, we'll move towards the goal set, ensuring we end within it.

New path proposal:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (5.5, 3.5),    # Unchanged
    (9.0, 5.33),   # Breakpoint (unchanged)
    (14.0, 4.0),   # Unchanged
    (17.0, 7.0),   # Unchanged
    (18.0, 12.0),  # Last valid point from the previous path
    (19.5, 12.0),  # Move right to avoid Obstacle 3
    (19.5, 17.0),  # Move up to clear Obstacle 3
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move to the goal set
]

Explanation of the changes:
1. We kept the valid portion of the path up to (18.0, 12.0).
2. From (18.0, 12.0), we added a point at (19.5, 12.0) to move right and avoid Obstacle 3. This point is chosen to be sufficiently far from the rightmost edge of Obstacle 3.
3. We then added a point at (19.5, 17.0) to move upwards and clear Obstacle 3 completely.
4. Finally, we added the endpoint (19.0, 19.0), which is within the goal set quadrilateral.

This new path should avoid all obstacles while still meeting all the requirements:
- It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
- It passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 5.33).
- It avoids all obstacles by maintaining a safe distance from them.
- The path is represented as an array of waypoints that can be connected linearly without intersecting any obstacles.
