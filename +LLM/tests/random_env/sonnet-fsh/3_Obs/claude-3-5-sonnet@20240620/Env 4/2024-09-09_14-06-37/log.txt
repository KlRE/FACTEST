# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[16.9, 14.5], [18.0, 12.3], [17.9, 17.6], [17.7, 18.6]]
			Obstacle 2: [[6.5, 19.2], [6.6, 15.8], [13.7, 17.8], [13.0, 19.2]]
			Obstacle 3: [[16.0, 18.9], [16.6, 7.2], [17.4, 7.0], [17.1, 10.9]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 7.24), (9.0, 20.6)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]

[09/09/2024 02:06:44 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and propose a path that meets all the criteria.

Analysis:
1. The start position is a square from (0,0) to (2,2).
2. The goal position is a square from (18,18) to (20,20).
3. There are three obstacles to avoid.
4. We need to pass through one of the breakpoints in the set [(9.0, 7.24), (9.0, 20.6)].

Path planning:
1. We'll start from a point within the start square.
2. We'll move towards the breakpoint at (9.0, 7.24), as it's more centrally located and allows for easier navigation around obstacles.
3. From there, we'll navigate around the obstacles to reach the goal.

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start square
    (5.0, 4.0),    # Move diagonally to avoid getting too close to potential obstacles
    (9.0, 7.24),   # Reach the chosen breakpoint
    (12.0, 10.0),  # Move towards the goal while staying clear of Obstacle 2
    (15.0, 13.0),  # Continue moving towards the goal, avoiding Obstacle 1
    (16.0, 16.0),  # Position to approach the goal while avoiding Obstacle 3
    (18.5, 18.5)   # End within the goal square
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set at (1.0, 1.0).
2. Passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 7.24).
3. Avoids all obstacles by maintaining a safe distance.
4. Ends within the goal set at (18.5, 18.5).
5. Uses arbitrary waypoints that are not always parallel to one axis, allowing for more flexible navigation around obstacles.

The path takes a somewhat diagonal approach to efficiently move from start to goal while satisfying all constraints. It stays clear of Obstacle 2 by passing below it, avoids Obstacle 1 by keeping to its left, and finally navigates around Obstacle 3 to reach the goal.

[09/09/2024 02:06:52 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that addresses the issues.

Analysis:
1. The current path intersects with Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3 in its final segment.
2. The valid subpath ends at (16.0, 16.0), which is close to the goal but surrounded by obstacles.
3. We need to find a way around these obstacles to reach the goal set.
4. The breakpoint (9.0, 7.24) is already included in the valid part of the path.

Spatial analysis:
1. Obstacle 1 is positioned in the upper-right corner, extending from about (16.9, 14.5) to (18.0, 18.6).
2. Obstacle 2 is in the upper part, from about (6.5, 15.8) to (13.7, 19.2).
3. Obstacle 3 is a vertical obstacle on the right side, from about (16.0, 7.0) to (17.4, 18.9).
4. There appears to be a narrow passage between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3 around y=17.

Path adjustment strategy:
1. Keep the valid part of the path up to (16.0, 16.0).
2. From there, move slightly left to avoid Obstacle 3.
3. Then move upwards to pass through the narrow gap between Obstacle 1 and 3.
4. Finally, move right to enter the goal set.

New path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (5.0, 4.0),
    (9.0, 7.24),
    (12.0, 10.0),
    (15.0, 13.0),
    (16.0, 16.0),
    (15.5, 16.5),
    (15.5, 17.5),
    (16.5, 17.5),
    (18.5, 18.5)
]

Explanation of new waypoints:
- (15.5, 16.5): Move slightly left to avoid Obstacle 3.
- (15.5, 17.5): Move upwards through the gap between Obstacle 1 and 3.
- (16.5, 17.5): Move right to prepare for entering the goal set.
- (18.5, 18.5): Enter the goal set.

This new path should avoid all obstacles while still reaching the goal set and maintaining the required breakpoint. The additional waypoints allow for more precise navigation around the obstacles in the crowded upper-right area of the space.

[09/09/2024 02:07:07 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and suggest a new path that avoids obstacles and meets all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The current path intersects with Obstacle 3 between points (15.5, 17.5) and (16.5, 17.5).
2. We need to adjust the path to avoid this intersection while still reaching the goal.
3. The valid subpath ends at (15.5, 17.5), so we'll continue from there.
4. Obstacle 3 extends from y=7.0 to y=18.9, blocking a direct path to the goal.
5. We need to go around Obstacle 3, either above or below it.
6. Going above seems more feasible as it's closer to the goal and avoids potential conflicts with Obstacles 1 and 2.

Path Adjustment:
1. We'll keep the valid subpath up to (15.5, 17.5).
2. From there, we'll move upwards to clear Obstacle 3.
3. Then we'll move right towards the goal area.
4. Finally, we'll move down slightly to enter the goal area.

Breakpoint consideration:
The path already passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 7.24) from Breakpoint Set 1, so we don't need to make any changes regarding breakpoints.

New path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 4.0),     # Waypoint (unchanged)
    (9.0, 7.24),    # Breakpoint (unchanged)
    (12.0, 10.0),   # Waypoint (unchanged)
    (15.0, 13.0),   # Waypoint (unchanged)
    (16.0, 16.0),   # Waypoint (unchanged)
    (15.5, 16.5),   # Waypoint (unchanged)
    (15.5, 17.5),   # Last valid point from previous path
    (15.5, 19.0),   # Move up to clear Obstacle 3
    (18.5, 19.0),   # Move right towards the goal area
    (18.5, 18.5)    # Move slightly down to enter the goal area
]

This new path should avoid all obstacles while still starting in the start set, ending in the goal set, and passing through the required breakpoint. The path takes a slight detour upwards to avoid Obstacle 3 before entering the goal area from above.
