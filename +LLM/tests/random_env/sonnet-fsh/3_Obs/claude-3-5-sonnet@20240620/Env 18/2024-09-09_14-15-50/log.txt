# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[17.8, 19.0], [15.7, 17.9], [17.5, 15.7], [18.1, 16.4]]
			Obstacle 2: [[19.3, 6.1], [17.4, 11.1], [17.5, 7.2], [19.2, 5.4]]
			Obstacle 3: [[18.1, 16.2], [7.6, 18.4], [8.3, 16.1], [8.9, 15.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 6.5), (9.0, 20.05)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[09/09/2024 02:15:56 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I've analyzed the environment and come up with a path that meets the specified criteria. Here's the path description and reasoning:

1. We'll start within the start set, near its center.
2. We'll move diagonally up and right to approach the breakpoint set.
3. We'll pass through the breakpoint at (9.0, 6.5), which is part of Breakpoint Set 1.
4. From there, we'll move upward and slightly right to avoid Obstacle 2.
5. Then, we'll move diagonally up and right, passing between Obstacles 1 and 3.
6. Finally, we'll approach the goal set from the bottom left, ending within it.

Here's the path represented as an array of waypoints:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),       # Start within the start set
    (5.0, 4.0),       # Move diagonally up and right
    (9.0, 6.5),       # Pass through the breakpoint
    (11.0, 10.0),     # Move up and slightly right to avoid Obstacle 2
    (16.0, 15.0),     # Move diagonally up and right, passing between Obstacles 1 and 3
    (19.0, 19.0)      # End within the goal set
]

This path satisfies all the requirements:
1. It starts within the start set and ends within the goal set.
2. It passes through one of the breakpoints (9.0, 6.5) from Breakpoint Set 1.
3. It avoids all obstacles with a safe distance.
4. The waypoints are arbitrary and not always parallel to one axis.
5. The path is represented as an array of waypoints that can be linearly connected.

The path takes a curved approach to navigate around the obstacles efficiently while meeting all the specified criteria.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[09/09/2024 02:16:05 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and suggest a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The valid subpath ends at (16.0, 15.0), which is close to the goal but surrounded by obstacles.
2. Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3 are blocking the direct path to the goal.
3. There appears to be a narrow passage between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3.
4. The path needs to pass through one of the breakpoints: (9.0, 6.5) or (9.0, 20.05).

Thought process for the new path:
1. Start from the valid point (1.0, 1.0) in the start set.
2. Keep the valid part of the path up to (9.0, 6.5), which satisfies the breakpoint requirement.
3. From (9.0, 6.5), we need to find a way around the obstacles to reach the goal.
4. Instead of going directly towards the goal, we'll move more to the right to avoid Obstacle 3.
5. Then, we'll curve around to approach the goal from the right side, avoiding Obstacle 1.
6. Finally, we'll enter the goal set from the right.

New path suggestion:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 4.0),    # Intermediate point (unchanged)
    (9.0, 6.5),    # Breakpoint (unchanged)
    (11.0, 10.0),  # Intermediate point (unchanged)
    (14.0, 13.0),  # New point to avoid Obstacle 3
    (17.0, 15.0),  # New point to curve around obstacles
    (19.0, 17.0),  # New point to approach goal from the right
    (19.5, 19.0)   # End point inside the goal set
]

This new path should:
1. Start in the correct start set
2. End in the correct goal set
3. Pass through the required breakpoint (9.0, 6.5)
4. Avoid intersecting with any obstacles by taking a wider curve around them
5. Maintain a safe distance from obstacles

The path now takes a more curved approach to the goal, avoiding the narrow passage between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3 where the previous path failed. By moving further to the right before approaching the goal, it should stay clear of all obstacles while still reaching the destination.
