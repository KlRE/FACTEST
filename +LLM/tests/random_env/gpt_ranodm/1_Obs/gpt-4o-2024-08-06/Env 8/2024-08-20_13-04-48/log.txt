# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[7.5, 17.4], [4.0, 15.1], [11.4, 15.2], [12.5, 16.5]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 6.58), (9.0, 19.56)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
new_path = [
    [0.5, 0.5], # start in the start set
    [0.0, 5.25], # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    [3.75, 5.25], # move rightwards to reach the gap
    [4.5, 4.5] # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/20/2024 01:04:55 PM] To design a path from the start set to the goal set, avoiding the specified obstacle, we'll plan a route that ensures the path doesn't intersect or come too close to the obstacle while also passing through one of the provided breakpoints.

### Provided Data Summary:
- **Start Quadrilateral**: [[2.0, 2.0], [0.0, 2.0], [0.0, 0.0], [2.0, 0.0]]
- **Goal Quadrilateral**: [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
- **Obstacle 1**: [[7.5, 17.4], [4.0, 15.1], [11.4, 15.2], [12.5, 16.5]]
- **Breakpoints**: (9.0, 6.58), (9.0, 19.56)

### Path Plan:
1. **Starting Point**: Choose a convenient starting point inside the start quadrilateral, e.g., (1.0, 1.0).
2. **Waypoint 1**: Move toward one of the breakpoints and ensure it is connected carefully without intersecting an obstacle, e.g., (9.0, 6.58).
3. **Waypoint 2 & Avoiding Obstacle**: Plan to move in a way to safely pass by the obstacle without intersection. Move upwards and slightly right to be above the obstacle, e.g., (13.0, 15.5).
4. **Final Waypoint**: Move toward the goal quadrilateral safely ensuring no crossings, ending the path within it, e.g., (19.0, 19.0).

### New Path:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),       # Starting within the start set
    (9.0, 6.58),      # Passing through the first breakpoint
    (13.0, 15.5),     # Bypassing the obstacle safely
    (19.0, 19.0)      # Ending within the goal set
]
```

This path respects all conditions: starts and ends within the start and goal quadrilateral, avoids the obstacle by sufficient margins, and includes waypoints that pass through required breakpoints without intersecting any obstacles.
