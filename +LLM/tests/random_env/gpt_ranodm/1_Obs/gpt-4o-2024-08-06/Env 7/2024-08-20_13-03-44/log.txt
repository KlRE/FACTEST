# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[7.4, 19.1], [15.9, 16.1], [17.3, 19.5], [11.3, 19.3]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 8.26), (9.0, 20.59)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
new_path = [
    [0.5, 0.5], # start in the start set
    [0.0, 5.25], # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate

[08/20/2024 01:03:53 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, we need to define a path that starts within the given start quadrilateral, passes through the required breakpoints, avoids the obstacle, and ends within the goal quadrilateral. Here's a suitable path:

### Path Plan
1. **Start:** Select a point within the start set quadrilateral. For simplicity, we can start at the center of the quadrilateral.
2. **Pass through Breakpoint Set 1:** Choose one breakpoint from the given set.
3. **End:** Select a point within the goal set quadrilateral.

### Defined Path
- **Start Point:** Choose the center of the start quadrilateral, i.e., (1.0, 1.0).
- **Breakpoint:** From Breakpoint Set 1, select (9.0, 8.26).
- **Intermediate Waypoint:** Navigate around the obstacle ensuring path clearance.
- **End Point:** Choose the center of the goal quadrilateral, i.e., (19.0, 19.0).

### Avoiding the Obstacle
To avoid Obstacle 1, the path should be carefully selected to go around without crossing. Given the obstacle is a quadrilateral, the path can navigate below or to the left of the obstacle.

### Final Path
The waypoints for the path, ensuring none cross obstacles and all requirements are met, can be outlined as follows:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),         # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 8.26),        # Pass through the selected breakpoint
    (9.5, 15.5),        # Intermediate waypoint to move around the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)        # End within the goal set
]
```

This path starts at (1.0, 1.0), moves through the breakpoint at (9.0, 8.26), detours at (9.5, 15.5) to avoid the obstacle while maintaining a safe distance from it, and ends within the goal area at (19.0, 19.0).

[08/20/2024 01:04:04 PM] To address the feedback regarding the current path and the segment crossing Obstacle 1, let's go through a thought process to provide a revised path that avoids this issue:

### Analysis of the Current Path

1. **Current Path**: 
   - The path starts at point (1.0, 1.0), moves through (9.0, 8.26) — which is a breakpoint of Set 1 — then heads to (9.5, 15.5) before finally attempting to reach the goal set at (19.0, 19.0).

2. **Obstacle Intersection**:
   - The path segment from (9.5, 15.5) to (19.0, 19.0) intersects with Obstacle 1. The obstacle's perimeter suggests that this path segment passes near or crosses the vertices, particularly between [15.9, 16.1] and [11.3, 19.3].

3. **Valid Subpath**:
   - The valid subpath up to (9.5, 15.5) should be retained as it doesn't intersect with the obstacle. From here, adjustments need to be made.

### Adjustments and New Path Proposal

1. **Objective**: Avoid Obstacle 1 by adding intermediate waypoints that circumvent the obstacle, while still proceeding toward the goal and passing through necessary breakpoints.

2. **Plan**:
   - Instead of heading directly from (9.5, 15.5) towards the goal, consider a detour that moves around the southern side of Obstacle 1 and stays clear.
   - Re-evaluate the terrain south of the obstacle, ideally maintaining a path that doesn't approach the obstacle closely.

3. **Revised Path**:
   - Starting from the valid subpath leading to (9.5, 15.5) and aiming to move around Obstacle 1:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),          # Start point within start set
    (9.0, 8.26),         # Breakpoint compliant with the requirement
    (9.5, 15.5),         # Highly maintained point up to the valid subpath
    (10.0, 17.0),        # Move slightly east from the obstacle
    (14.0, 18.0),        # Continue northeast, avoiding the obstacle's north perimeter
    (18.5, 19.0),        # Approach the goal from a direction that avoids collision
    (19.0, 19.0)         # Endpoint within the goal set
]
```

### Explanation of the Adjustments

- **Waypoint (10.0, 17.0)**: Moves slightly east and up, ensuring clearance from the obstacle's side.
- **Waypoint (14.0, 18.0)**: Continues further northeast, adjusting for safe passage while keeping mindful of the obstacle's northern extent.
- **Waypoint (18.5, 19.0)**: Approaches the final destination, maintaining a safe buffer from the upper edge of the obstacle while proceeding toward the goal.

This revamped path respects the spatial relationships and requirements, ensuring the path is clear from obstacles while maintaining compliance with breakpoints and endpoint conditions.

[08/20/2024 01:04:13 PM] To adjust the path so it avoids intersecting with the obstacle while meeting all given constraints, let's analyze why the previous path failed and how we can correct it.

### Analysis

1. **Start and Goal Considerations:**
   - The path should start within the start quadrilateral, which is correctly set at `(1.0, 1.0)`.
   - The path should end in the goal quadrilateral and it successfully ends at `(19.0, 19.0)`.

2. **Obstacle Intersection:**
   - The segment from `(10.0, 17.0)` to `(14.0, 18.0)` intersects with Obstacle 1. This requires adjustment to prevent the path from crossing through the obstacle.

3. **Valid Subpath:**
   - The obstructive segment has a valid subpath up to `(10.0, 17.0)`. We need to find a detour around the obstacle to maintain the path validity.

4. **Breakpoints:**
   - The path correctly passes through one of the provided breakpoints `(9.0, 8.26)`.

### Strategy for Correction

1. **Adjust the Path to Avoid the Obstacle:**
   - To bypass the obstacle, identify a route that skirts around it while maintaining a clear path.

2. **Introduce Waypoints:**
   - Add intermediate waypoints that guide the path above or below the obstacle.

### Proposed New Path

1. Start from `(1.0, 1.0)`.
2. Continue to `(9.0, 8.26)` to pass through the first breakpoint.
3. Divert slightly upwards or downwards to avoid the obstacle:
   - From `(9.0, 8.26)`, adjust towards `(9.0, 16.0)` to create a straight upward path clear of the obstacle's influence.
4. Circumvent the obstacle by moving outside its upper boundary:
   - Introduce a waypoint at `(9.0, 19.5)`.
5. Proceed to `(14.5, 19.5)` to maintain a clear path around the obstacle.
6. Direct towards the goal, finalize with `(19.0, 19.0)`.

### New Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 8.26),
    (9.0, 16.0),
    (9.0, 19.5),
    (14.5, 19.5),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This path uses waypoints to avoid the obstacle by moving around its periphery while maintaining a clear line between points. The waypoints ensure the path remains valid, as linear segments do not intersect with any obstacles and also achieves the requirement of passing through a breakpoint.

[08/20/2024 01:04:24 PM] # Adjusting the Path

### Problem Analysis
The previous path encountered an issue with intersection at the segment between points (9.0, 16.0) and (9.0, 19.5) as it crossed through the obstacle defined by vertices [[7.4, 19.1], [15.9, 16.1], [17.3, 19.5], [11.3, 19.3]]. The task requires us to adjust the path to avoid crossing this obstacle while ensuring the path passes through the required breakpoints and ends successfully in the goal region.

### Path Adjustment Strategy
1. **Continue from the Valid Subpath:**
   - The longest valid subpath from start is [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 8.26), (9.0, 16.0)]. We should start from (9.0, 16.0) and find a new way to proceed towards the goal.

2. **Obstacle Avoidance:**
   - Since the path between (9.0, 16.0) and (9.0, 19.5) crosses the obstacle, an approach could be to navigate closely around the obstacle's perimeter while maintaining a clear distance.
   
3. **Path to Goal via Breakpoints:**
   - As identified, our path must pass through a valid breakpoint set, but it seems the segment we chose intersects an obstacle. We'll try to modify this by adjusting our waypoints to go around the potential area of intersection while maintaining compliance with passing through at least one valid breakpoint.

4. **Introducing New Waypoints:**
   - A new waypoint before reaching (9.0, 19.5), close enough to keep the path clear of the obstacle.

### New Path Proposal
Let's devise a path that circumvents the obstacle by deviating slightly after point (9.0, 16.0).

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),         # Start point within the start set
    (9.0, 8.26),        # Pass through the required breakpoint
    (9.0, 16.0),        # Continue along the verified path
    (9.0, 19.0),        # Navigate upwards but stay clear of the obstacle
    (14.0, 19.0),       # Move right, parallel to the obstacle edge but clear of it
    (19.0, 19.0)        # Ending point in the goal set
]
```

### Explanation
- **(9.0, 19.0):** We move vertically near the left border of the obstacle, comfortably staying outside of it.
- **(14.0, 19.0):** By moving horizontally along the y=19.0, we are avoiding the obstacle, considering it ends at x=17.3.
- **(19.0, 19.0):** This final waypoint transitions us into the goal region safely while passing clear of the obstacle boundary.

This sequence ensures that none of the segments intersect the given obstacle, while satisfying the constraints of starting and ending in their respective sets and passing through at least one breakpoint.

[08/20/2024 01:04:38 PM] ## Thought Process and Path Adjustment

1. **Initial Path Review**:  
   The provided path begins correctly within the start set and ends appropriately in the goal set. However, Segment 3 of the path—which runs between points (9.0, 16.0) and (9.0, 19.0)—intersects with Obstacle 1. We need to adjust the path to circumvent this obstacle.

2. **Analyzing Segment 3**:  
   The issue arises due to a vertical line segment that crosses into the obstacle region. Obstacle 1 is positioned at a coordinate range that includes parts of Segment 3. Given the vertices of Obstacle 1, a better strategy would be to route the path either to the left or right of the obstacle or add a waypoint above it.

3. **Potential Path Adjustments**:  
   - **Left Bypass**: Considering the orientations of obstacle vertices, swinging the path leftwards before reaching (9.0, 16.0) could avoid the intersection.
   - **Right Bypass**: Moving to the right may interfere with other boundary limits or may not remain within the goal of a streamlined path.
   - **Above the Obstacle**: To keep the route simple and direct, move slightly above the higher edge of the obstacle, skirting it.

4. **Selecting Breakpoints Wisely**:  
   Although the original path already successfully incorporates a breakpoint from Set 1, we need to ensure the final path respects obstacle clearances. We will use this knowledge and modify the path accordingly.

## New Path Suggestion
Given these considerations, here is a proposed path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),        # Starting within the start set
    (9.0, 8.26),       # First breakpoint, continuation
    (9.0, 15.9),       # Curve before reaching the problematic segment point
    (11.0, 16.5),      # Slight deviation over the top edge of the obstacle, sidestepping issue
    (14.0, 17.0),      # Continue around to join the safe upper side
    (19.0, 19.0)       # Terminates within the goal set
]
```

## Explanation  
- **Efficient Clearance**: When segment (9.0, 15.9) is reached, the path navigates around the upper boundary of the obstacle, maintaining clearance safely without conflict.
- **Goal Alignment**: Finally, the path seamlessly transitions from (14.0, 17.0) to reach the goal within set parameters.
- **No New Obstacle Intersections**: This adjustment ensures avoidance of any potential obstacle intersections while retaining validity.
  
This revised path respects both the start and goal constraints, successfully skirting the problematic obstacle while adhering to the non-crossing and breakpoint requirements.

[08/20/2024 01:04:48 PM] To modify the given path such that it avoids intersecting with obstacles, let's analyze the situation and create a new valid path through logical reasoning.

### Analysis of Current Path
1. **Current Path Segments:**
   - (1.0, 1.0) to (9.0, 8.26)
   - (9.0, 8.26) to (9.0, 15.9)
   - (9.0, 15.9) to (11.0, 16.5)
   - (11.0, 16.5) to (14.0, 17.0) - **Intersects with Obstacle 1**
   - (14.0, 17.0) to (19.0, 19.0)

2. **Obstacle Characteristics:**
   - Obstacle 1 has vertices [[7.4, 19.1], [15.9, 16.1], [17.3, 19.5], [11.3, 19.3]].
   - The problematic segment is (11.0, 16.5) to (14.0, 17.0) as it passes through this obstacle.

### Approach to Correct the Path
1. **Modify or Add Waypoints:** The segment from (11.0, 16.5) to (14.0, 17.0) must be rerouted to avoid Obstacle 1.
2. **Continue from the Valid Subpath:** We will build upon the valid subpath [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 8.26), (9.0, 15.9), (11.0, 16.5)].

### New Path
To avoid the obstacle, we can detour around the southern edge of the obstacle by adding intermediary waypoints:

**Waypoint Adjustments:**
- From (11.0, 16.5), move slightly south to create a gap from the northern boundary of the obstacle.
- Add waypoint (11.0, 16.0) to move downward just enough to skirt around the bottom edge of the obstacle.
- Bypass the eastern corner of the obstacle before heading towards the goal.
- From (11.0, 16.0), travel to (15.0, 16.0) to stay south of the obstacle.
- Lastly, head from (15.0, 16.0) to (19.0, 19.0), which ends inside the goal set.

So, a possible revised path is:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start in the start set
    (9.0, 8.26),  # Pass through the first breakpoint
    (9.0, 15.9),  # Continue upward near obstacle
    (11.0, 16.5), # Previously valid point
    (11.0, 16.0), # Move south to avoid entering the obstacle
    (15.0, 16.0), # Move east along the southern edge of the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End in the goal set
]
```
