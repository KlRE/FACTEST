# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[16.5, 17.7], [13.3, 16.2], [16.5, 8.4], [17.1, 8.6]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 10.0)]

    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

[08/20/2024 12:59:56 PM] To design a path that adheres to your requirements, we will select waypoints that start within the start set, pass through the breakpoint, avoid the obstacle, and end within the goal set. Here's the path constructed under those conditions:

### New Path
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 10.0), # Pass through the Breakpoint Set 1
    (18.5, 17.0), # Navigate around the obstacle, keeping a safe distance
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End within the goal set
]
```

### Explanation
1. **Start Point**: (1.0, 1.0) is a point within the start quadrilateral.
2. **Breakpoint**: (9.0, 10.0) is part of Breakpoint Set 1. The path passes through this mandatory waypoint.
3. **Obstacle Avoidance**: The waypoint (18.5, 17.0) is chosen to safely navigate around Obstacle 1, ensuring that the path does not intersect the obstacle.
4. **End Point**: (19.0, 19.0) lies within the goal quadrilateral, thus satisfying the requirement to end in the goal region.

This configuration ensures a viable path from the start to the goal while adhering to the given constraints.

[08/20/2024 01:00:11 PM] ### Thought Process and Analyzing the Current Path

1. **Current Path Review**: The initial path provided is:
   ```
   path = [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 10.0), (18.5, 17.0), (19.0, 19.0)]
   ```
   - Start Point `(1.0, 1.0)` is inside the start quadrilateral.
   - End Point `(19.0, 19.0)` is within the goal quadrilateral.
   - Path successfully passes through the breakpoint set at `(9.0, 10.0)`.

2. **Interference with Obstacles**:
   - The segment between `(9.0, 10.0)` and `(18.5, 17.0)` crosses Obstacle 1, defined as:
     ```
     Obstacle 1: [[16.5, 17.7], [13.3, 16.2], [16.5, 8.4], [17.1, 8.6]]
     ```
   - This means we need to find an alternate route that navigates around the obstacle without cutting through it.

### Adjusting the Path

- **Analyzing the Obstacle**:
  - Observe that Obstacle 1 is blocking the direct path to the goal.
  - We need to find a path that circumvents this obstacle while maintaining a reasonable distance to avoid 'touching'.

- **Alternative Path**:
  - Consider creating a path that goes either above or below this obstacle.

- **New Path Considerations**:
  - We will choose a new waypoint that diverts the path around the obstacle while maintaining clearance.
  - Since the obstacle extends vertically, moving either further above or below might work.
  - Let's select a path that circumvents this via above, given the coordinates and spatial setup.

### New Path Proposal

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Starting within the start area
    (9.0, 10.0),   # Pass through the required breakpoint
    (13.0, 12.0),  # Divert above the obstacle, ensuring clearance
    (18.5, 16.0),  # Continue towards the right direction avoiding the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Ending at the goal area
]
```

### Path Description

1. **Starting from `(1.0, 1.0)`**:
   - The path initiates well within the defined start quadrilateral.

2. **Reaching the Breakpoint `(9.0, 10.0)`**:
   - Adheres to the requirement to pass through the specified breakpoint.

3. **Navigating around the Obstacle**:
   - The waypoint `(13.0, 12.0)` serves to make a northward diversion, effectively routing the path around Obstacle 1's north side.
   - Adjusted the y-coordinate upward to create a bypass while avoiding the obstacle boundary.

4. **Continuing to the Goal**:
   - The segment `(18.5, 16.0)` ensures a trajectory towards the goal while steering clear of obstruction.
   - Appropriately fixes y to maintain clearance from the obstacle while moving in the required direction.
   
5. **Ending at `(19.0, 19.0)`**:
   - Successfully terminates within the goal quadrilateral, fulfilling path completion criteria.

### Conclusion

This adjusted path respects all original constraints, including avoiding obstacles, passing through the breakpoint, starting within the start region, and ending within the goal area. The chosen waypoints ensure that a collision-free path is plotted.

[08/20/2024 01:00:21 PM] To construct a valid path avoiding the given obstacle, let's analyze the spatial layout:

1. **Start and End Sets**: The start is within the coordinates [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]], and the goal is within [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]. The initial chosen start and endpoints at `(1.0, 1.0)` and `(19.0, 19.0)` are valid.

2. **Obstacle**: The obstacle is defined by [[16.5, 17.7], [13.3, 16.2], [16.5, 8.4], [17.1, 8.6]]. The problematic segment in the previous path is between `(13.0, 12.0)` and `(18.5, 16.0)`, which intersects this obstacle according to the feedback.

3. **Breakpoint**: We have a breakpoint at `(9.0, 10.0)` that needs to be included in our path.

### Proposed Path Adjustments
Since the segment `(13.0, 12.0)` to `(18.5, 16.0)` crosses the obstacle, we need to reroute around this obstacle. A possible adjustment could involve considering a path around either the left or the right of the obstacle.

- Continue from the valid part of the path: start with the valid points `(1.0, 1.0)`, `(9.0, 10.0)`, `(13.0, 12.0)`.
- Bypass the obstacle by staying on its left and then moving upward to approach the goal.

Here's a revised path:

1. Begin at `(1.0, 1.0)` in the start set.
2. Proceed to the first breakpoint `(9.0, 10.0)`.
3. Move to `(13.0, 12.0)` from the previous valid path.
4. Instead of moving towards `(18.5, 16.0)`, detour to the right of the obstacle:
   - Move to `(14.0, 15.0)` to gradually start moving up and around the obstacle.
5. Continue upward to `(16.0, 17.0)` to clearly bypass the upper edge of the obstacle.
6. Finally, approach the goal set by moving straight to `(19.0, 18.5)`, ensuring it remains in the goal area and slightly above the obstacle’s top boundary.

### New Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start
    (9.0, 10.0),  # Breakpoint
    (13.0, 12.0), # Valid part continuation
    (14.0, 15.0), # Move around the obstacle
    (16.0, 17.0), # Continue to bypass the obstacle
    (19.0, 18.5)  # End in Goal set
]
```

This path ensures compliance with all specified requirements by introducing detour points to effectively navigate around the obstacle while integrating the required breakpoints.

[08/20/2024 01:00:30 PM] To address the issue with the current path's intersection with an obstacle, let's go through the process of analyzing the spatial relationships and adjust the path accordingly:

1. **Analysis of Current Path:**
   - The path is currently: `[(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 10.0), (13.0, 12.0), (14.0, 15.0), (16.0, 17.0), (19.0, 18.5)]`.
   - The segment from `(13.0, 12.0)` to `(14.0, 15.0)` intersects with Obstacle 1, which is defined by `[[16.5, 17.7], [13.3, 16.2], [16.5, 8.4], [17.1, 8.6]]`.

2. **Obstacle Avoidance Strategy:**
   - Since the path between `(13.0, 12.0)` and `(14.0, 15.0)` crosses into the area of the obstacle, we need to redirect this segment. 
   - One option is to maneuver either towards below the obstacle or why not try to detour above it.
   
3. **Breakpoint Consideration:**
   - We have already used the required breakpoint `(9.0, 10.0)`, which lies on the valid part of our subpath.

4. **Proposed New Path:**
   - To avoid the obstacle, let's navigate the path to bypass it either below or by steering upwards between waypoints adequately positioned, thereby ensuring safe clearance from obstacles.

### New Path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),       # Start in the start set
    (9.0, 10.0),      # Pass through the required breakpoint
    (13.0, 12.0),     # Continue along the already valid path
    (13.0, 14.0),     # Move upwards to bypass obstacle 1 effectively
    (12.0, 16.0),     # Continued detour around the obstacle
    (16.0, 17.0),     # Resume close to the previous path, ensuring clear of the obstacle
    (19.0, 18.5),     # End in the goal set as before
]
```

### Explanation:
- **Detour**: The key alteration is the inclusion of `(13.0, 14.0)` and `(12.0, 16.0)` to provide an upward detour around the top boundary of the obstacle.
- **Clearance**: These waypoints are chosen to confidently steer the trajectory clear of the hazard presence while still maintaining a reasonable path length.
- **Path Completion**: The path resumes its course towards the goal set after avoiding the obstacle and ends in the designated area assumingly meeting distance criteria.

This revised strategy keeps the path within the defined requirements and sidesteps the detected obstruction problem.

[08/20/2024 01:00:39 PM] To address the intersection issues with the obstacle and to meet the path requirements of starting within the start set, reaching the goal set, and passing through the specified breakpoint, it is essential to adjust the original path. Here is a detailed thought process on how to correct the path:

### Analyzing the Problem
1. **Starting Point**: The path should begin within the provided start quadrilateral. From the feedback, the initial point (1.0, 1.0) already meets this requirement.
2. **Breakpoint**: The path must pass through the breakpoint (9.0, 10.0), which the original path correctly does.
3. **Obstacles Analysis**: The originally provided path segment between (12.0, 16.0) and (16.0, 17.0) intersects with Obstacle 1, as noted in the feedback. Therefore, this part of the path must be adjusted to avoid the obstacle.
4. **Ending Point**: The path must end inside the goal quadrilateral. The endpoint (19.0, 18.5) meets this requirement.

### Path Adjustment Strategy
- **Avoiding the Obstacle**: The key issue is the intersection of the path with Obstacle 1 between waypoints (12.0, 16.0) and (16.0, 17.0). We should adjust this segment to skirt around the obstacle by finding a path that avoids crossing it.
- **Adding Waypoints**: Introduce new waypoints that gently steer the path around the obstacle without intersecting it and while keeping a safe distance.

### New Path Construction
1. Start from the valid subpath: [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 10.0), (13.0, 12.0), (13.0, 14.0), (12.0, 16.0)]
2. From (12.0, 16.0), slightly redirect upward to avoid crossing Obstacle 1 but remain within safe limits.
3. Skirt around the obstacle by moving east and slightly northwards to ensure clearance from the obstacle's boundary.
4. Reconnect to the original end goal within the goal set while maintaining obstacle avoidance.

### Suggested New Path
```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Starting point
    (9.0, 10.0),     # Breakpoint
    (13.0, 12.0),
    (13.0, 14.0),
    (12.0, 16.0),
    (14.0, 17.0),    # Redirecting slightly upward and east to avoid Obstacle 1
    (18.0, 17.5),    # Continue east further north to ensure clearance
    (19.0, 18.5)     # Ending point in the goal set, ensuring clear path
]
```

### Explanation of Changes
- The segment from (12.0, 16.0) onward is adjusted by introducing a point (14.0, 17.0) to steer clear of the obstacle by moving slightly upward.
- As a continuation, a point (18.0, 17.5) is added to further avoid intersection and makes a gradual approach to the goal.
- The final waypoint ensures the endpoint is within the goal set, following a valid trajectory that steers clear of any obstacles.

This adjusted path strategically navigates around the obstacle without crossing it and satisfies all motion planning requirements.

[08/20/2024 01:00:50 PM] ### Thought Process

1. **Identify the Start and End Sets**: The path needs to begin within the start set defined and end in the goal set. The start of the path at \((1.0, 1.0)\) is a valid choice, and it appropriately ends within the goal set at \((19.0, 18.5)\).

2. **Navigating Breakpoints and Obstacles**: The path passes through the breakpoint \((9.0, 10.0)\) as required. It also avoids intersecting the obstacle, with the exception of the segment from \((14.0, 17.0)\) to \((18.0, 17.5)\).

3. **Collision Detection and Adjustment**: The feedback indicates that the segment from \((14.0, 17.0)\) to \((18.0, 17.5)\) intersects with an obstacle. The intersection seems to occur near the upper part of the obstacle between the coordinates \((16.5, 17.7)\) and \((13.3, 16.2)\).

4. **Path Adjustment Strategy**:
   - I will maintain the longest valid subpath identified: \((1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 10.0), (13.0, 12.0), (13.0, 14.0), (12.0, 16.0), (14.0, 17.0)\).
   - Adjust the segment starting from \((14.0, 17.0)\) to navigate around the obstacle by introducing additional waypoints to the east and slightly north, as going south doesn't offer viable paths due to the obstacle's shape.

5. **New Segments Beyond the Last Valid Waypoint**:
   - Add a waypoint that travels north and then east to clear the obstacle: \( (14.5, 18.0) \).
   - After clearing, connect it to \( (17.0, 18.5) \), ensuring it's safely away from obstacle edges.
   - Proceed towards the end point within the goal set \((19.0, 18.5)\).
