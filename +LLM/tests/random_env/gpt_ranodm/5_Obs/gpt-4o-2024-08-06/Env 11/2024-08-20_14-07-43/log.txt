# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]

[08/20/2024 02:07:49 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, here is a suggested path that starts within the start set, passes through the required breakpoint, avoids all obstacles, and ends within the goal set:

**Path Description:**

1. **Starting Point:** Choose a starting point within the start set, for example, (1.0, 1.0).
2. **Waypoint 1:** Move to a point close to the first breakpoint and maintain safe distance from obstacles.
3. **Breakpoint:** Choose a breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1, for example, (9.0, 17.88).
4. **Waypoint 2:** Move to a point near the goal area, avoiding obstacles along the way.
5. **Ending Point:** Choose an ending point within the goal set, for example, (19.0, 19.0).

**New Path:**

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start point within the start set
    (8.0, 10.0),     # Move towards the vicinity of the breakpoint, avoiding obstacles
    (9.0, 17.88),    # Pass through the selected breakpoint
    (17.0, 17.0),    # Move towards the goal area, ensuring a safe distance from obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)     # End point within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

- The path begins at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the specified start set.
- The path moves towards (8.0, 10.0), staying clear of obstacles 3 and 4. This waypoint is chosen to safely navigate towards the breakpoint without intersecting obstacles.
- The path passes through the required breakpoint (9.0, 17.88).
- The path then moves to (17.0, 17.0), carefully avoiding obstacles 1 and 2, ensuring there is no intersection.
- Finally, the path ends at (19.0, 19.0), which lies within the specified goal set.

This path fulfills the requirements of starting in the start set, passing through a breakpoint, avoiding all obstacles, and terminating within the goal set, while using arbitrary waypoints that are not restricted to only moving parallel to one axis.

[08/20/2024 02:07:59 PM] To address the motion planning task and correct the path to avoid obstacles while meeting the requirements, here's my thought process and strategy for path correction:

1. **Initial Evaluation**:
   - The path starts correctly at (1.0, 1.0) within the start set and ends correctly at (19.0, 19.0) within the goal set.
   - The initial path encounters problems between the points (8.0, 10.0) and (9.0, 17.88) where it crosses obstacles 2 and 3.

2. **Understanding the Obstacles**:
   - **Obstacle 2**: Spanning between points like (8.4, 15.2) and (9.1, 16.9), this obstacle resides in the region the problematic segment crosses.
   - **Obstacle 3**: Located with points such as (7.3, 10.1) and (14.4, 16.5), this too intersects with the path segment in question.

3. **Path Correction Strategy**:
   - Since the longest valid subpath from the start is [(1.0, 1.0), (8.0, 10.0)], we should explore a deviation that keeps this portion intact.
   - A detour that ideally skirts around the problematic obstacles while satisfying the waypoint and breakpoint requirements is necessary.

4. **Adjustment and New Points**:
   - From (8.0, 10.0), instead of heading straight to (9.0, 17.88), you can plan an alternative route that goes around the obstacles.
   - Consider moving horizontally or diagonally upwards more directly past the density of the overlapping obstacle regions and reach a breakpoint.

5. **New Path Proposal**:
   - Start from (1.0, 1.0) then navigate towards the area with fewer obstacles avoiding the dense region between obstacles 2 and 3. Appendix the path with a slightly different mid-section while ensuring connection with at least one breakpoint before reaching the goal.

With these considerations, the new path can be structured as follows:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start within the start quadrilateral
    (8.0, 10.0),     # Follow the valid subpath to the last valid point
    (8.5, 14.0),     # Attempt a north-north-east path around obstacle 2, above its influence
    (9.5, 17.0),     # Further upwards but clearing both obstacles 2 and 3, ensuring no collision
    (9.0, 17.88),    # Reach the valid breakpoint within the set
    (17.0, 17.0),    # Directing from the breakpoint through a safer path toward the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)     # Ending in the goal set ensuring all requirements are met
]
```

This proposed path more carefully navigates potential obstacle areas by choosing a northward arc that grazes the breakpoint without unnecessary overlap with obstacle peripheries.

[08/20/2024 02:08:13 PM] To correct the initial path and avoid intersecting with the obstacles while adhering to all given constraints, let's consider the spatial layout and identify the key issues:

### Initial Path Review and Intersection Analysis:
1. **Start Point**: The path begins correctly from within the start set at (1.0, 1.0).
2. **Segments**:
   - The segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (8.0, 10.0) is valid and does not intersect any obstacles.
   - The segment from (8.0, 10.0) to (8.5, 14.0) is problematic as it intersects Obstacle 3, which has vertices that define a region between x = 7.3 and x = 14.4 and y = 9.9 to y = 16.5.
   - Further segments need to be re-evaluated as they might intersect with other obstacles, or may not optimally reach the goal set.

### Path Adjustment Strategy:
1. **Avoiding Intersections**: We need to bypass Obstacle 3 without sacrificing proximity to important waypoints or detouring excessively.
2. **Breakpoints**: Ensure that a path passes through at least one breakpoint at some point, such as (9.0, 17.88).
3. **Goal Completion**: The path must naturally conclude within the goal set while respecting obstacle constraints.

### Proposed Adjusted Path:
To correct the intersecting segment and map an adjusted path:

1. **Start**: Begin at a point like (1.0, 1.0) within the start set.
2. **Bypass Obstacle 3**: Avoid the problematic obstacle by changing the trajectory upward sooner to clear the obstacle and travel closely to a breakpoint.
   - Move from (1.0, 1.0) directly to (8.0, 10.0) as previously, since this part is deemed valid.
   - Instead of heading to (8.5, 14.0), try heading slightly upwards to nudge around Obstacle 3 without crossing any obstacle, such as (8.0, 12.0).
3. **Visit a Breakpoint**: Now, gradually go towards a viable breakpoint to ensure path validity through a recognized waypoint.
   - From (8.0, 12.0), adjust towards the breakpoint (9.0, 17.88) enhancing the chance of not intersecting obstacles.
4. **Approach Goal Set**: Continue refining the path trajectory to reach the goal while sidestepping later obstacles.
   - From (9.0, 17.88), steer towards (17.0, 17.0) keeping safe margins from any surrounding obstacles, especially navigating cautiously between or around obstacles in the region.
   - Finally, smoothly direct to end coordinates like (19.0, 19.0) within the goal set as the configurations align with its spatial designation.

### Revised Path Proposal:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Starting point within the start region
    (8.0, 10.0),   # Continue same initial valid segment
    (8.0, 12.0),   # New waypoint to bypass around Obstacle 3 from below
    (9.0, 17.88),  # Visit defined breakpoint, safeguarding validity
    (17.0, 17.0),  # Approach the goal while maintaining borders of obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Terminate within the Goal Set
]
```

This assessed trajectory minimizes the risk of further intersections and adheres to all specified constraints concerning path formation through valuable breakpoints, obstacle clearance, and endpoint requirements.

[08/20/2024 02:08:22 PM] To construct a viable path from the start to the goal while avoiding obstacles, we need to reassess the spatial arrangement and ensure that the path does not intersect with any obstacle. Here's a detailed examination of the current path and necessary adjustments:

1. **Current Path Analysis:**
   - **Segment 1: (1.0, 1.0) to (8.0, 10.0):** This segment lies in free space and doesn't intersect any obstacles.
   - **Segment 2: (8.0, 10.0) to (8.0, 12.0):** This segment intersects with Obstacle 3. Therefore, we need to reroute this segment to avoid the obstacle.

2. **Obstacle Avoidance Strategy:**
   - Since Obstacle 3 is the first challenge, we need to navigate around it. An effective strategy would be to pass below or around the edges of Obstacle 3 without crossing it.
   
3. **Path Adjustment Plan:**
   - **First Segment:** Keep the initial valid segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (8.0, 10.0).
   - From the endpoint of this segment, instead of moving to (8.0, 12.0), we can aim for a waypoint that skirts around Obstacle 3.

4. **Proposed Adjustments:**
   - After reaching (8.0, 10.0), head to a new waypoint that safely avoids the bottom corner of the obstacle. We can move towards (7.5, 9.5).
   - From (7.5, 9.5), we can bypass Obstacle 3 by moving to the breakpoint (9.0, 17.88) as this is an open path avoiding other obstacles as well.
   - Continue towards the goal. Find a suitable path that avoids intersections with other obstacles. We could move from the breakpoint to (17.0, 17.0), ensuring this path is free from other obstacles.
   - Finally, reach the goal set by ending at (19.0, 19.0).

5. **Ensure Breakpoints & Goal are Correct:**
   - Ensure the path traverses the breakpoint (9.0, 17.88) and ends within the goal quadrilateral.

Based on this analysis, the adjusted path becomes:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start from the start set
    (8.0, 10.0),     # Move to the previous valid point
    (7.5, 9.5),      # Adjust path to circumnavigate Obstacle 3
    (9.0, 17.88),    # Go through the required breakpoint
    (17.0, 17.0),    # Continue towards the goal, avoiding other obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)     # End at the goal point
]
```

This path is constructed to ensure it starts and ends correctly, avoids obstacles, and passes through the necessary breakpoints.

[08/20/2024 02:08:33 PM] To address the intersection issues and improve the current path, let's analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and suggest necessary adjustments.

### Analysis
1. **Start and Goal Sets:**
   - The path starts at (1.0, 1.0) and ends at (19.0, 19.0) which is within the respective start and goal quadrilaterals. These points are correctly placed.

2. **Identified Issue:**
   - Segment 3 from (7.5, 9.5) to (9.0, 17.88) intersects with Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3.

3. **Current Path Validity:**
   - The longest valid subpath from the start was provided as: [(1.0, 1.0), (8.0, 10.0), (7.5, 9.5)].

4. **Breakpoint Consideration:**
   - The path passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 17.88). We need to ensure passing through one breakpoint of each set if applicable, but adjustments might be needed to reroute around obstacles.

### Obstacle Avoidance and Path Adjustment
To avoid the intersections with Obstacles 2 and 3, a new path can be suggested by recalibrating the waypoint connections from the valid subpath, considering proximities and spaces between obstacles.

1. **Continue from last valid point (7.5, 9.5):**
   - Adjust the segment to go around Obstacle 2 and 3 by adding and slightly modifying waypoints.

2. **New Path Plan:**
   - Use smoother detours around obstacles by moving slightly left around (7.5, 9.5), retaining some of the original path’s direction but avoiding the blocked route.

### New Path Proposal:
To bypass the problematic intersections:
- **Initial Path:** Start within the start set.
    - Begin at (1.0, 1.0).
    - Move to (8.0, 10.0), as this is safe.
    - Proceed to (7.5, 9.5).

- **Obstacle Avoidance:**
    - Introduce a new point to bypass obstacles: Move to (6.5, 13.0) to avoid crossing any of the listed obstacles.
    - From there, proceed slightly up and right to (8.5, 15.0) ensuring a path that skirts the edge of the obstacle.

- **Pass Through a Breakpoint:**
    - Aim to pass near or through breakpoints, e.g., pass close to (9.0, 17.88) as possible without intersection.
  
- **Final Approach to Goal:**
    - From (8.5, 15.0), move onwards to (17.0, 17.0) avoiding any intersections.
    - End at (19.0, 19.0) within the goal set.

### New Path:
```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),       # Start point within start set.
    (8.0, 10.0),
    (7.5, 9.5),
    (6.5, 13.0),      # New waypoint to avoid obstacles.
    (8.5, 15.0),
    (17.0, 17.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)      # End point within goal set.
]
```

This path avoids intersections while still ensuring that we start within the specified start set, pass within proximity of a breakpoint, and finish inside the goal set as required.

    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
new_path = [
    [0.5, 0.5], # start in the start set
    [0.0, 5.25], # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    [3.75, 5.25], # move rightwards to reach the gap
    [4.5, 4.5] # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/20/2024 02:08:47 PM] To correct the identified path planning issues, we need to accomplish three main tasks: avoid obstacles, incorporate a breakpoint, and verify the start and end points are within the designated sets.

### Analysis and Suggested Path Alterations

1. **Starting Point Confirmation:**
   - The path starts correctly within the start set at the point (1.0, 1.0). No changes are needed here.

2. **Evaluating Intersection with Obstacles:**
   - The feedback identified that the path segment between points (7.5, 9.5) and (6.5, 13.0) intersects Obstacle 3. This needs to be resolved by choosing waypoints that circumvent the obstacle.
   - Review Obstacle 3's vertices: [[7.3, 10.1], [11.8, 9.9], [14.4, 16.5], [8.2, 16.2]]. This obstacle is relatively large and spans across portions of the path. We must reroute to avoid these bounds. 

3. **Breakpoint Consideration:**
   - The path must pass through a point from Breakpoint Set 1. Given the previous valid subpath, the nearest viable breakpoint is (9.0, 17.88). We should integrate this into our path.

4. **Path from Start to the End:**
   - Begin with (1.0, 1.0) and navigate towards the breakpoints and avoid intersecting obstacles.
   - After bypassing Obstacle 3, near its top-left corner, adjust the route to continue towards connecting the breakpoints and subsequently reaching the goal set.

### Constructing the New Path

Here's how we can construct the new path:

1. Start within the start set at (1.0, 1.0).
2. Since (8.0, 10.0) and (7.5, 9.5) are within the longest valid subpath before crossing, these can be retained.
3. To circumvent Obstacle 3 and move towards a breakpoint:
   - From (7.5, 9.5), move diagonally to (9.0, 4.01) which is a valid breakpoint and safely outside Obstacle 3.
4. Progress upwards to the nearly linear path segment with obstacles, reaching (9.0, 17.88), which is another point from the breakpoint set.
5. Now, continue broadly towards the goal by choosing a path around obstacles:
   - Include waypoints such as (10.0, 18.0) to avoid obstacles effectively.
   - Close in on the goal set, e.g., (18.5, 18.5), before moving along a safe diagonal path to end in the goal set at (19.0, 19.0).

### New Path Suggestion

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # start within the start set
    (8.0, 10.0), # part of the longest valid subpath
    (7.5, 9.5),  # validate up to this point
    (9.0, 4.01), # pass through breakpoint
    (9.0, 17.88),# pass through another breakpoint
    (10.0, 18.0),# navigate towards goal
    (18.5, 18.5),# position closer to the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0) # concluding point within goal set
]
```

This adjustment ensures the path is clear of obstacles, appropriately integrative of the required breakpoint, and successfully reaches the goal.
