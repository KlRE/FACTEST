# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[10.2, 0.1], [13.8, 4.6], [13.6, 9.2], [12.3, 6.1]]
			Obstacle 2: [[7.5, 17.2], [0.2, 15.8], [3.3, 15.7], [10.6, 16.2]]
			Obstacle 3: [[0.1, 10.1], [12.9, 14.7], [8.6, 17.9], [0.3, 15.5]]
			Obstacle 4: [[11.6, 2.1], [16.5, 11.8], [16.1, 13.2], [14.6, 12.8]]
			Obstacle 5: [[0.7, 9.1], [4.0, 4.3], [7.8, 9.2], [7.7, 12.1]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 5.64), (9.0, 19.8)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
new_path = [
    [0.5, 0.5], # start in the start set
    [0.0, 5.25], # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    [3.75, 5.25], # move rightwards to reach the gap
    [4.5, 4.5] # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/20/2024 02:04:28 PM] To create a path that adheres to the given requirements, we need to find a sequence of waypoints that begin inside the start quadrilateral, pass through at least one breakpoint, and terminate within the goal quadrilateral without intersecting the obstacles. Here's a proposed path:

### Start Inside the Start Position:
- Choose a starting point inside the Start Position, e.g., (1.0, 1.0).

### Waypoints Considerations:
- Navigate around obstacles and ensure the path passes through at least one breakpoint from the set.
- We need distinct waypoints that move around obstacles without intersecting them.

### Path Plan:

1. **Start** at a chosen location within the Start Position:  
   (1.0, 1.0) 

2. **Move to a point near Breakpoint Set 1** while avoiding obstacles:
   - Choose the first breakpoint in Set 1: (9.0, 5.64)
   - A waypoint between: (5.0, 3.0) to avoid the lower part of Obstacle 1.
   - Then proceed to the first breakpoint: (9.0, 5.64)

3. **Navigate Across to Goal** avoiding all obstacles:
   - Move upwards and somewhat rightward to circumvent further obstacles and aiming towards the goal, moving to (17.0, 15.0).
   - Finally, reach a point inside the Goal Position: (19.0, 19.0)

### Proposed New Path:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start within the start position
    (5.0, 3.0),     # Intermediate waypoint to steer clear of obstacles
    (9.0, 5.64),    # Breakpoint passage
    (17.0, 15.0),   # Another waypoint clearing obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)    # Finish within the goal position
]
```

### Path Verification:
- Ensure none of the waypoints or line segments connecting waypoints intersect the outlined obstacles.
- The proposed waypoints adhere to the constraint of starting inside the Start Position, passing through a breakpoint, and ending within the Goal Position while maintaining a safe path around obstacles.

		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[08/20/2024 02:04:36 PM] To solve the motion planning task, we need to choose a path that begins in the given start set, passes through the specified breakpoints, avoids all obstacles, and ends in the provided goal set. Here’s how we can adjust the path considering the feedback and spatial relationships:

### Initial Path Analysis
The initial path provided was:
``` 
path = [(1.0, 1.0), (5.0, 3.0), (9.0, 5.64), (17.0, 15.0), (19.0, 19.0)]
```

**Issues Noticed:**
- The segment between waypoints (9.0, 5.64) and (17.0, 15.0) intersects with Obstacle 4.

### Steps to Correct the Path

1. **Start and Goal Set**: The start point (1.0, 1.0) and the endpoint (19.0, 19.0) are within their respective quadrilaterals, which is correct.

2. **Obstacle Analysis and Avoidance**:

   - **Obstacle 4**: The intersection happens with this obstacle. We need to reroute between the last valid point (9.0, 5.64) and the next intended target by avoiding this obstacle.

3. **Path Rerouting**:
   - From (9.0, 5.64), instead of directly moving towards (17.0, 15.0), plan a path that goes around Obstacle 4.
   - Aim to go slightly further away from the right side of Obstacle 4 and navigate back to align with the original endpoint. Here’s a potential strategic detour:

4. **Adding New Waypoints**:
   - Introduce an intermediate point that skirts around the obstacle to avoid crossing into Obstacle 4.
   - Consider a waypoint around (12.5, 14.0), which would guide the path around the obstacle's boundary.
   - Proceed then to (16.5, 17.0) before heading to (19.0, 19.0).

### New Path Proposal
After making the adjustments to bypass the problematic obstacle intersection while ensuring the path remains in the constraints:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),         # Starting point within start set
    (5.0, 3.0),         # Valid waypoint
    (9.0, 5.64),        # Valid breakpoint
    (12.5, 14.0),       # New waypoint avoiding Obstacle 4
    (16.5, 17.0),       # Align with the original path but avoid obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)        # Endpoint within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation**:
- The added waypoints are designed to skirt around potential problem zones while keeping a safe distance from obstacles.
- Ensuring that points along the route offer a clear line of sight that doesn't intersect the regions covered by obstacles, specifically around Obstacle 4, allows a clean passage to the goal.

This revised path maintains alignment with the waypoints and requirements given, ensuring optimal path planning while avoiding obstacles.
