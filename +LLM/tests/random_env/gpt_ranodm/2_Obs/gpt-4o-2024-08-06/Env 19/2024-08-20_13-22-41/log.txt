# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[11.2, 6.1], [16.4, 6.3], [20.0, 14.0], [16.4, 11.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[8.0, 13.5], [11.3, 8.9], [16.0, 19.7], [8.8, 14.8]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 5.05), (9.0, 18.46)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
new_path = [
    [0.5, 0.5], # start in the start set
    [0.0, 5.25], # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    [3.75, 5.25], # move rightwards to reach the gap
    [4.5, 4.5] # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/20/2024 01:22:47 PM] To design a path that starts within the start position, ends in the goal position, and avoids obstacles while passing through each set of breakpoints, we need to carefully choose waypoints.

### Considerations:

1. **Start:** The point should be within the start quadrilateral defined by the vertices [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]].
2. **Goal:** The point should be within the goal quadrilateral defined by the vertices [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]].
3. **Breakpoints:** Incorporate at least one point from the breakpoint set into your path.
4. **Obstacle Avoidance:** The path should avoid the obstacles defined.

### Path Selection:
A potential path could be carefully selected as follows:

1. Start point: (1.0, 1.0) - an arbitrary point inside the start set.

2. First waypoint: Move towards the breakpoint while avoiding the obstacles by maintaining a path that doesn't intersect with obstacle edges. We chose one of the breakpoints: (9.0, 5.05).

3. Navigate around the obstacles by selecting a careful path around them:
    - A waypoint at (12.0, 9.0), which navigates between obstacle 1 and obstacle 2.

4. Proceed towards the goal area:
    - A waypoint at (18.5, 19.0), approaches the goal area while remaining clear of all obstacles.

5. End point: (19.0, 19.0) - in the goal set area.

### Proposed Path:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start point within the start quadrilateral
    (9.0, 5.05),     # Pass through the chosen breakpoint
    (12.0, 9.0),     # Navigate between obstacles
    (18.5, 19.0),    # Approaching the goal area
    (19.0, 19.0)     # End point within the goal quadrilateral
]
```
This proposed path ensures that the path starts from an acceptable position in the start area, passes through a designated breakpoint, avoids intersection with the given obstacles, and ends well within the goal area.
