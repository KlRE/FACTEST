# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[18.9, 14.3], [10.9, 13.2], [12.7, 1.9], [18.6, 12.1]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 6.74), (9.0, 19.61)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]

[08/20/2024 01:12:30 PM] To construct a path that avoids the obstacles and adheres to the given requirements, we will select waypoints that ensure the path starts within the Start Position, ends within the Goal Position, passes through one breakpoint from each set, and avoids intersecting the obstacles.

### Selected Path
Let's outline a path that adheres to these criteria:

1. **Start Point**: Choose a point within the Start Position. Let's start at (1.0, 1.0).
2. **Pass Through Breakpoint Set 1**: Choose the breakpoint (9.0, 6.74) from Breakpoint Set 1.
3. **Avoid Obstacles and Progress Towards Goal**:
   - Bypass the first obstacle by choosing a waypoint that routes around it.
   - Choose a waypoint (11.0, 10.0) to navigate around the larger obstacle area.
   - Use another waypoint (16.0, 16.0) to steer clear of the second obstacle.
4. **End Point**: Choose a point within the Goal Position, such as (19.0, 19.0).

### New Path
Given these considerations, the path is structured as follows:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),       # Start within the Start Position
    (9.0, 6.74),      # Breakpoint from the set Breakpoint Set 1
    (11.0, 10.0),     # Navigate around obstacles
    (16.0, 16.0),     # Further navigation to avoid second obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)      # End within the Goal Position
]
```

This path carefully avoids crossing the specified obstacles and ensures compliance with the need to pass through the required breakpoints while reaching the goal.

[08/20/2024 01:12:38 PM] To address the problem of the waypoint path crossing an obstacle, we need to thoroughly examine the path segments and adjust them to avoid any intersections with the obstacles provided. Let's analyze the current path and adjust it accordingly:

### Current Path Analysis
1. **Current path:** [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 6.74), (11.0, 10.0), (16.0, 16.0), (19.0, 19.0)]
   
2. **Valid Subpath and Intersection:**
   - The path initially moves from (1.0, 1.0) to (9.0, 6.74) to (11.0, 10.0), which is valid and does not intersect any obstacles. However, the segment from (11.0, 10.0) to (16.0, 16.0) intersects with Obstacle 1.

### Spatial Relationships and Obstacles
- **Obstacle 1** is preventing the straightforward linear movement from (11.0, 10.0) to (16.0, 16.0), and we need to plot a path around it.
- **Obstacle 2** does not intersect with the current path and does not need to be moved around.

### Adjusting the Path
- **Goal**: Adjust the path to avoid Obstacle 1 and maintain the valid subpath using alternate waypoints not crossing any obstacle.
  
1. **From (11.0, 10.0)**: We need to deviate from this point to avoid Obstacle 1.
   - A possible adjustment is to move upwards in the Y-direction to navigate around the obstacle's top boundary safely.

2. **New waypoint proposed**: Move to a point like (14.0, 11.5) which adjusts the path direction around the top and right side of Obstacle 1.

3. **Continuation**: From the adjusted waypoint, head towards the goal position while ensuring the path ends in the goal region.
   - Continue to (17.0, 17.0) as it maintains clearance from Obstacle 1 and moves towards the goal quadrant without crossing.

### Revised Path
Adhering to the new waypoint adjustments, the full path avoiding obstacles:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Starting Point within Start Set
    (9.0, 6.74),    # Breakpoint ensuring initial correct direction
    (11.0, 10.0),   # Valid subpath continuation
    (14.0, 11.5),   # New waypoint avoiding Obstacle 1 intersection
    (17.0, 17.0),   # Navigates close but avoids Obstacle 1 and heads toward goal
    (19.0, 19.0)    # Ending point within the Goal Set
]
```

This new path maintains the key requirements of starting and ending in the designated start and goal sets while passing through necessary breakpoints and avoiding all defined obstacles effectively.

[08/20/2024 01:12:47 PM] ### Analyzing the Current Path

1. **Start Position**: The first waypoint (1.0, 1.0) is correctly within the start set.

2. **Goal Position**: The final waypoint (19.0, 19.0) is within the goal set.

3. **Longest Valid Subpath**: The current path is valid up to the waypoint (11.0, 10.0).

4. **Issue at Segment 3**: The segment between (11.0, 10.0) and (14.0, 11.5) intersects with Obstacle 1. This is the area that needs adjustment to avoid this crossing.

5. **Breakpoints**: The path correctly passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 6.74) from the first set. It's necessary to navigate through at least one of the specified breakpoints.

### Spatial Relationship and Obstacle Analysis

- **Obstacle 1** is a concern because the segment intersects it. Analyzing its vertices, we need to maneuver around it by potentially stretching the path to the left or right of this obstacle.
  
- **Obstacle 2** is not currently affecting the path, which is beneficial, but care should be taken so that adjustments around Obstacle 1 don't inadvertently cross into Obstacle 2.

### Proposed Path Adjustment Strategy

1. **Continue from Valid Path**: Retain the first valid subpath [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 6.74), (11.0, 10.0)] as the initial segment.

2. **Avoiding Obstacle 1**: Introduce additional waypoints to navigate around Obstacle 1 without crossing it.

3. **Add a Checking Point**: Place an additional waypoint sufficiently far from Obstacle 1, breaking the segment between (11.0, 10.0) and (14.0, 11.5) to ensure a clean route.

4. **Path to Goal**: Ensure the path ends in the goal set, maintaining the final waypoint at (19.0, 19.0).

### New Path Proposal with Adjustments

Let's create a way around Obstacle 1 by adding a waypoint that horizontally and then vertically avoids the obstacle without crossing its boundaries.

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),        # Start in the start set
    (9.0, 6.74),       # Pass through the breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1
    (11.0, 10.0),      # Extend the valid subpath
    (11.0, 12.0),      # Navigate vertically to avoid high part of Obstacle 1
    (15.0, 14.0),      # Move diagonally to align towards the goal avoiding obstacles
    (17.0, 17.0),      # Continue clear path towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)       # Safely end in the goal set
]
```

This path reroutes around Obstacle 1 by first moving upwards and then diagonally, safely reaching the goal set. This avoids intersections while maintaining compliance with the requirements of starting and ending in the designated sets and passing through necessary breakpoints.

[08/20/2024 01:12:55 PM] To correct the path and avoid crossing the obstacles, I need to reassess the spatial relationships between the given path points and the obstacles to determine how to redirect the path.

### Analysis and Adjustments:

1. **Current Path Review:**
   - The path starts at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start position.
   - The path passes through the required breakpoint at (9.0, 6.74).
   - The path segment between (11.0, 12.0) and (15.0, 14.0) intersects with Obstacle 1.
   - The path ends at (19.0, 19.0), which is within the goal position.

2. **Spatial Relationship and Problem Segment Identification:**
   - Obstacle 1 has vertices at [[18.9, 14.3], [10.9, 13.2], [12.7, 1.9], [18.6, 12.1]]. The problematic segment intersects with this obstacle.
   - The segment from (11.0, 12.0) to (15.0, 14.0) crosses the obstacle probably because it doesn't maintain enough distance from the edges or completely traverse through this area, making it necessary to reroute around the obstacle.

3. **Adjustment Strategy:**
   - Maintain the initial valid subpath: [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 6.74), (11.0, 10.0), (11.0, 12.0)].
   - To avoid Obstacle 1, attempt to re-route by adding new waypoints to navigate around this problematic region. Consider points that safely redirect above or below this obstacle.

4. **New Path Proposal:**
   - Begin from (1.0, 1.0) in the start area.
   - Move to the required breakpoint (9.0, 6.74).
   - Continue to (11.0, 10.0) and (11.0, 12.0)—continuing in the valid direction.
   - Safely navigate above Obstacle 1 by selecting a waypoint such as (11.5, 13.0) and (14.0, 14.5) to ensure bypassing the obstacle completely above.
   - From (14.0, 14.5), proceed to (17.0, 17.0) to maintain a path clear of the top side of Obstacle 1.
   - Finally, move to (19.0, 19.0) within the goal area.

### New Path:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),        # Start in the start set
    (9.0, 6.74),       # Pass through the required breakpoint
    (11.0, 10.0),      # Continue moving towards the goal
    (11.0, 12.0),      # Valid part of the subpath
    (11.5, 13.0),      # Bypass above Obstacle 1
    (14.0, 14.5),      # Further bypass above Obstacle 1
    (17.0, 17.0),      # Close path towards goal
    (19.0, 19.0)       # End in the goal set
]
```
This new path ensures that each segment does not intersect the obstacles and abides by the path requirements, maintaining distance from obstacles where necessary.

[08/20/2024 01:13:05 PM] To construct a valid path that adheres to the provided requirements, I will analyze the spatial relationships between the current path segments and the obstacles, and propose adjustments to avoid intersections. Since the feedback indicates that the path intersects with an obstacle at the segment between points (11.0, 12.0) and (11.5, 13.0), I need to adjust the path to bypass this obstacle while maintaining adherence to start, goal, and breakpoints.

### Analysis and Adjustments

1. **Initial Analysis**: 
    - The given start point (1.0, 1.0) and the initial segment (1.0, 1.0) to (9.0, 6.74) are valid as they do not intersect with any obstacles.
    - The segment from (9.0, 6.74) to (11.0, 10.0) is also clear of obstacles.
    - The intersection occurs between (11.0, 12.0) and (11.5, 13.0) with Obstacle 1.

2. **Obstacle Avoidance**:
    - To bypass Obstacle 1, I need to navigate around it after reaching (11.0, 12.0).
    - Given the configuration of Obstacle 1, I'll consider moving eastwards, then upwards, slightly away from its boundary.

3. **Path Adjustment**:
    - From the point (11.0, 12.0), the next move should skirt around Obstacle 1 by shifting horizontally and vertically to clear the obstacle.

4. **New Path**:
    - Start at (1.0, 1.0) within the start set.
    - Pass through the valid segment to (9.0, 6.74) — satisfies first breakpoint requirement.
    - Continue to (11.0, 10.0), still clear of obstacle intersections.
    - Adjust from (11.0, 12.0) directly alternate the path such that it clears obstruction:
        - Move to (13.0, 12.5) — shifts slightly above and right of the problematic segment.
        - Move north-east to (15.0, 15.0) — continuing to avoid the obstacle.
    - Proceed to (17.0, 17.0), and then (19.0, 19.0), ending in the goal set.

### Finalized Path

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start point
    (9.0, 6.74),    # Breakpoint Set 1 — Correct
    (11.0, 10.0),   # Continues avoiding obstacles
    (11.0, 12.0),   # Prior to where previous intersection occurred
    (13.0, 12.5),   # Adjusted to avoid Obstacle 1
    (15.0, 15.0),   # Further upward/northeast
    (17.0, 17.0),   # Nearing the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End point within goal set
]

This path incorporates avoidance of Obstacle 1 while maintaining valid movement through the required areas, ensuring a linear and clear transit from the start to the goal.

[08/20/2024 01:13:15 PM] To address the feedback and ensure the corrected path meets all the required conditions, we need to adjust the path segments to avoid intersecting with obstacles, especially with Obstacle 1. The intercepted segment previously was between (11.0, 12.0) and (13.0, 12.5). We'll have to detour around this obstacle carefully.

### Analysis and Correction:
1. **Starting Point:** We begin again at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start set.
2. **Breakpoints:** The initial path successfully passed through the required breakpoint (9.0, 6.74), so we will keep this point.
3. **Valid Subpath:** The valid subpath up to (11.0, 12.0) is the longest path that does not intersect with an obstacle, and we will continue from here.
4. **Problematic Segment:** From (11.0, 12.0) to (13.0, 12.5) intersects with Obstacle 1. We'll need to divert from this course to avoid the obstacle. We should reroute towards a lower y-value safely away from the obstacle.
5. **Bypassing Obstacle 1:** We consider the spatial configuration of Obstacle 1 and determine a point that would navigate around it without intersection.

### New Path Proposal:
We'll extend from the last valid waypoint by creating a detour below Obstacle 1:

- **Detour:** We'll adjust the path leg from (11.0, 12.0) to curve below and around the obstacle:
  - Instead of moving upwards at x = 11, drift slightly downwards to create a safe margin. 
  - Reconnect higher outside the influence of the obstacle:
    - Move from (11.0, 12.0) to (11.5, 11.0) - a slight move downwards, visibly moving away from the obstacle.
    - Continue to divert around (12.5, 11.0) and then move toward a clear path to the goal.
  - From this position, we can curve back upwards:
    - Move upwards to (15.0, 14.0) - clear outside the obstacle.
    - Then continue directly to the goal: (17.5, 18.0), and finally (19.0, 19.0) in the goal set.

This ensures we maintain a safe distance from any obstacles while incorporating the necessary breakpoints and satisfying the path constraints.

### New Path:
The adjusted path is as follows:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start in the start set
    (9.0, 6.74),     # Pass through the breakpoint
    (11.0, 10.0),    # Continue valid leg
    (11.0, 12.0),    # Continue valid leg
    (11.5, 11.0),    # Shift downwards to avoid obstacle
    (12.5, 11.0),    # Extend the safe detour
    (15.0, 14.0),    # Redirect upwards away from any obstacle
    (17.5, 18.0),    # Go towards the goal region
    (19.0, 19.0)     # End in goal set
]
```

This new path respects all spatial restraints, avoids obstacles, includes the necessary breakpoints, and effectively reaches the goal set.
