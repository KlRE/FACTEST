# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[14.5, 8.1], [12.0, 3.7], [18.7, 5.0], [19.3, 8.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[6.1, 19.6], [3.3, 15.8], [7.8, 15.4], [10.7, 17.1]]
			Obstacle 3: [[7.6, 18.2], [16.7, 18.4], [14.2, 19.5], [8.7, 18.6]]
			Obstacle 4: [[16.8, 12.1], [10.2, 18.8], [12.4, 12.8], [14.1, 12.3]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 7.05), (9.0, 18.12), (9.0, 20.32)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

[08/20/2024 01:57:41 PM] To create a path that satisfies the given requirements, we'll need to select starting and ending points within the designated start and goal sets, while ensuring the path passes through at least one breakpoint from each set and avoids the obstacles.

### Path Planning:

1. **Start Point**: We'll choose a point inside the start set. For simplicity, let's start from (1.0, 1.0), which is well within the defined start quadrilateral.

2. **Breakpoint from Set 1**: We'll choose the breakpoint (9.0, 7.05).

3. **Intermediate Waypoint to Avoid Obstacles**:
   - After reaching the first breakpoint (9.0, 7.05), we need to navigate around obstacles to reach the goal set.
   - We can pass between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 4, where there's a clear corridor between (12.0, 12.0) upwards to (14.0, 14.0), ensuring we avoid Obstacle 3 positioned to the right.

4. **Final Approach to the Goal Set**: 
   - From (14.0, 14.0), the path will move directly towards the goal set, avoiding close encounters with obstacles.

5. **End Point**: We'll end at (19.0, 19.0), which is well within the goal quadrilateral.

### Planned Path:

Here is the path represented as an array of waypoints:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),       # Start point within the start set
    (9.0, 7.05),      # First breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1
    (12.0, 12.0),     # Intermediate waypoint to navigate around obstacles
    (14.0, 14.0),     # Another waypoint to continue navigating safely
    (19.0, 19.0)      # End point within the goal set
]
```

### Path Explanation:

- The path begins within the start set and passes through a carefully selected breakpoint.
- Intermediate waypoints have been chosen to avoid obstacles, ensuring a safe, non-intersecting path.
- The path ends within the goal set, completing the requirements.

[08/20/2024 01:57:49 PM] In the initial path, the segment between the waypoints (12.0, 12.0) and (14.0, 14.0) intersects with Obstacle 4. To avoid this obstacle while complying with all path requirements, I will adjust the path accordingly. Here's the breakdown of my thought process:

1. **Starting Point:** The starting waypoint of the path at (1.0, 1.0) is correctly positioned within the start set.

2. **Waypoint through Breakpoint:** The path successfully goes through the breakpoint (9.0, 7.05), as required. This part can remain the same since it does not intersect with any obstacles.

3. **Identifying the Obstacle:** Obstacle 4 is where the path intersects. It lies within the path from (12.0, 12.0) to (14.0, 14.0). It’s essential to reroute the path around Obstacle 4 to avoid intersecting it.

4. **Rerouting Around Obstacle:** The problematic segment (12.0, 12.0) to (14.0, 14.0) needs rerouting. I plan to navigate around Obstacle 4 by diverting the path before reaching (12.0, 12.0), taking it around the obstacle while keeping a safe distance.

5. **Path Continuation:** After avoiding Obstacle 4, the path will continue towards the goal area, ensuring it ends within the goal set (20.0, 20.0).

6. **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, ensure that the path reaches the goal set without intersecting any obstacles.

Here's a redefined path that avoids the obstacles, particularly Obstacle 4:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start point within start set
    (9.0, 7.05),     # Through a valid breakpoint, avoiding all obstacles to this point
    (10.5, 10.5),    # Navigate towards this point avoiding Obstacle 4
    (11.0, 14.0),    # Shift towards the top to bypass the obstacle 
    (13.0, 16.0),    # Safely maneuver above the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)     # Approach the goal, ensuring it's within the correct region
]
```

By redirecting the path slightly upwards past the (12.0, 12.0) mark and then curving around Obstacle 4, this revised path ensures no intersections with the obstacles and guides the path successfully from the start to the goal set.

[08/20/2024 01:57:58 PM] To adjust the path and avoid crossing obstacles, let's consider the spatial relationships and the feedback provided:

1. **Start and End Points:** The initial path successfully begins and ends within the designated Start and Goal quadrilaterals.

2. **Obstacle Interaction:** The problematic segment is between (11.0, 14.0) and (13.0, 16.0), which intersects with Obstacle 4. Therefore, we need to modify this part of the path.

3. **Longest Valid Subpath:** The valid path up to the point of intersection is [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 7.05), (10.5, 10.5), (11.0, 14.0)].

4. **Obstacle Avoidance Strategy:**   
   - Since segment 4 crosses Obstacle 4, we need a path that avoids this and ensures clearance.
   - Consider a detour mid-way after the valid point (11.0, 14.0). Since Obstacle 4’s coordinates suggest a problematic interaction, we need to circumvent around or below it.

5. **Proposed Detour:**  
   - Introduce a waypoint below the bottom edge of Obstacle 4. This can be below the minimum y-coordinate of Obstacle 4's vertices, perhaps around y = 12.0 for clearance.
   - Next, continue towards the goal while ensuring we keep a safe distance from any obstacle.

6. **New Waypoints:**  
   - Reroute from (11.0, 14.0) downward to pass below Obstacle 4.  
   - After clearing, move back up towards the goal set, ensuring not to intersect with Obstacle 3.

Here's a refined path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start point within the start quadrilateral
    (9.0, 7.05),     # Breakpoint from the given set
    (10.5, 10.5),    # Continue towards goal bypassing Obstacle 1
    (11.0, 14.0),    # Last valid waypoint before problematic segment
    (12.0, 12.0),    # Added this point to avoid Obstacle 4 from below
    (15.0, 15.0),    # Move towards goal ensuring to bypass Obstacle 3
    (19.0, 19.0)     # Goal point within the goal quadrilateral
]
```

This path considers a downward adjustment after the last valid waypoint and ensures movement around Obstacle 4 while safely heading towards the goal. This should bypass all obstacles while adhering to the other constraints provided.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

[08/20/2024 01:58:07 PM] ### Thought Process

1. **Understanding the Valid Subpath:**
   - The valid subpath from the start is `[(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 7.05), (10.5, 10.5), (11.0, 14.0), (12.0, 12.0)]`. This path is working well until reaching `(12.0, 12.0)`.

2. **Identifying and Avoiding the Obstacle:**
   - At the segment between `(12.0, 12.0)` and `(15.0, 15.0)`, the path intersects with **Obstacle 4** defined by vertices `[[16.8, 12.1], [10.2, 18.8], [12.4, 12.8], [14.1, 12.3]]`.
   - The task is to find a way around this obstacle and still proceed toward the goal set.

3. **New Strategy to Adjust the Path:**
   - **Avoidance:** I should add a waypoint that skirts around Obstacle 4. To do this, I could move slightly upward or downward after `(12.0, 12.0)` to ensure we are not crossing the obstacle.
   - **Checking Alignments:** After avoiding the obstacle, find a path that trends back toward the goal set while ensuring the path traverses through at least one of the breakpoints.

4. **Maintaining Breakpoint Compliance:**
   - The current valid subpath already uses the breakpoint `(9.0, 7.05)`, so this compliance is maintained.

5. **Plan Execution:**
   - After assessing the nearby area of Obstacle 4 and its alignment with other elements, strategically adjust the path to avoid intersection while maintaining the trajectory toward the goal.

### Adjustments and New Path

1. From the valid subpath ending at `(12.0, 12.0)`, introduce a waypoint that helps circumvent the obstacle.
2. Suggest a sideways deviation either upwards or downwards that is sufficient to avoid intersection but maintains a reasonable route to the goal.
3. After circumventing, gradual steering toward the goal set should be possible, ensuring collision-free segments.

### New Path Plan

Here is an adjusted path avoiding the obstacle:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 7.05),     # Reaching the breakpoint
    (10.5, 10.5),    # Ongoing direction toward goal
    (11.0, 14.0),    # Continues without obstacle conflict
    (12.0, 12.0),    # Valid waypoint before adjustment
    (12.0, 15.0),    # Adjusted way to go around obstacle 4
    (14.5, 17.0),    # Continued movement while avoiding obstacle
    (16.2, 17.6),    # Final adjustment approaching goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)     # End within the goal set
]
```

This path incorporates a strategic deviation to move around Obstacle 4, while continuing smoothly toward the intended goal area, all without jeopardizing safety from obstacles and ensuring pathway correctness through checkpoints.

[08/20/2024 01:58:16 PM] To establish a valid path that begins in the start set, includes necessary waypoints, and avoids obstacles while concluding in the goal set, we first need to carefully examine the current path and identify issues that lead to intersecting obstacles.

### Analyzing the Current Path:

1. **Start Position and Initial Waypoints:**
   - The path commences at `(1.0, 1.0)`, which is valid as it resides within the start set.
   - It proceeds to the first breakpoint `(9.0, 7.05)`; this breakpoint passage is required and correctly incorporated.

2. **Obstacle Interaction:**
   - The path segment from `(10.5, 10.5)` to `(11.0, 14.0)` is valid.
   - The segment from `(12.0, 12.0)` to `(12.0, 15.0)` is where the problem arises. It intersects with Obstacle 4: `[[16.8, 12.1], [10.2, 18.8], [12.4, 12.8], [14.1, 12.3]]`.
   
3. **Path Continuation:**
   - The remaining points fail to adjust around the identified obstacle.

### Proposed Adjustments to Avoid Obstacles:

1. **Reroute Around Obstacle:**
   - After `(12.0, 12.0)`, adjust the path by diverting away from the obstacle, such as by going slightly west and north before proceeding towards the destination.

2. **Include Mandatory Breakpoint:**
   - Maintain a path through the necessary breakpoints that ensures none of the application's mandatory requirements are neglected.

### Constructing the New Path:

- **Suggested Waypoints:**
  - Start inside the start set, say at `(1.0, 1.0)`.
  - Move directly to the critical breakpoint `(9.0, 7.05)`.
  - From there, continue smoothly to `(10.5, 10.5)` and then to `(11.0, 14.0)` to stay within a safe margin from obstacles.
  - Adjust the slightly problematic section by sidestepping westwards or eastwards (or northwards):
    - Navigate from `(11.0, 14.0)` to `(11.5, 16.0)` to circle above obstacle 4.
    - Then proceed to `(13.5, 17.0)`, overtaking any remaining obstacles by maintaining a safe clearance.
  - Approach the goal area, closing the path with `(19.0, 19.0)` inside the goal region.

### New Path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),         # Starting point within the start set
    (9.0, 7.05),        # Breakpoint (mandatory passage)
    (10.5, 10.5),       # Safe continuation
    (11.0, 14.0),       # Maintaining safe clearance from obstacles
    (11.5, 16.0),       # Circling to avoid an obstacle and avoid intersection
    (13.5, 17.0),       # Path adjustment to maintain clearance
    (19.0, 19.0)        # Ending within the goal set
]
```

This suggested series of waypoints aims to recompense the problematic intersection area while ensuring the path stays compliant with all given requirements.

    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
new_path = [
    [0.5, 0.5], # start in the start set
    [0.0, 5.25], # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    [3.75, 5.25], # move rightwards to reach the gap
    [4.5, 4.5] # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/20/2024 01:58:25 PM] To correct the path and ensure that it does not intersect with any obstacles, I will analyze the spatial relationships between the waypoints and the obstacles. The original path segment between (11.0, 14.0) and (11.5, 16.0) intersects with Obstacle 4, so this segment needs adjustment.

### Path Analysis and Correction

1. **Starting Valid Path**: 
   - The path starts correctly at (1.0, 1.0) in the start set.
   - The path to the first breakpoint (9.0, 7.05) is valid.
   - Continuing to (10.5, 10.5) is also valid.
   - The segment from (10.5, 10.5) to (11.0, 14.0) also remains outside obstacle boundaries, keeping it valid.

2. **Problematic Segment**:
   - The segment (11.0, 14.0) to (11.5, 16.0) crosses Obstacle 4, so it needs to be adjusted.

3. **Adjustment Strategy**:
   - First, find a waypoint that avoids intersecting Obstacle 4. A possible approach is to stay close to the valid trajectory but shift it out of the obstacle's range.
   - The goal is to go around Obstacle 4 by either proceeding northwards or northwest, avoiding its western side.
   - Reconnect back to the original path after safely bypassing the obstacle.

4. **New Path Proposal**:
   - I'll introduce a new waypoint between (11.0, 14.0) and (13.5, 17.0) that circles the obstacle.

### New Path

To correct the intersection, I propose the following path:

```text
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),        # Start in the start set
    (9.0, 7.05),       # First breakpoint
    (10.5, 10.5),      # Continue valid path
    (11.0, 14.0),      # Last valid before intersection
    (12.0, 14.5),      # New waypoint to avoid obstacle 4 from the lower side
    (13.5, 17.0),      # Reconnect with the former waypoint after avoiding the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)       # End in the goal set
]
```

**Explanation**:
- The new waypoint at (12.0, 14.5) helps to detour the lower part of Obstacle 4 by giving a wider berth. By moving slightly northwards and then west at an early stage, the path can circumvent the boundary of the obstacle.
- This adjustment keeps the path within clearance for the obstacle and aligns it back to utilize most of the original valid path.
- Finally, the path ends correctly inside the specified goal set at (19.0, 19.0).

This configuration should resolve any conflicts with the existing obstacles while meeting the path requirements and constraints.
