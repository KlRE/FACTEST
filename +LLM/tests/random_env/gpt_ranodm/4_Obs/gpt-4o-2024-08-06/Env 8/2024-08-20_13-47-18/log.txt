# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

[08/20/2024 01:47:26 PM] ## Path Planning

### Considerations for Planning:

1. **Start and Goal Positions:**
   - Start can be any point within the quadrilateral: `[[2.0, 2.0], [0.0, 2.0], [0.0, 0.0], [2.0, 0.0]]`.
   - Goal can be any point within the quadrilateral: `[[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]`.

2. **Obstacles:**
   - The obstacles are defined by their vertices.
   - Keep a safe distance from these obstacles to avoid collisions, considering their irregular shapes.

3. **Breakpoints:**
   - The path must pass through one of the breakpoints specified in Breakpoint Set 1: `[(9.0, 0.36), (9.0, 16.9)]`.

### Path Development:

1. **Choosing Start and End:**
   - Start at center `(1.0, 1.0)` of the start quadrilateral.
   - End at center `(19.0, 19.0)` of the goal quadrilateral.

2. **Pathway Between Start and Goal:**
   - Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints from the provided set.
   - Plan to avoid all obstacles by keeping the path outside their defined vertices.

### Proposed Path:

Given the above considerations, here is the proposed path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start point in the start position
    (9.0, 0.36),    # Breakpoint from Set 1
    (13.0, 6.0),    # Move diagonally upwards and right, avoiding Obstacle 4
    (12.5, 13.0),   # Move upwards to avoid Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3
    (10.0, 17.0),   # Stay on the left of the goal area, avoiding Obstacle 3
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End point in the goal position
]
```

### Path Characteristics:

- The path starts at `(1.0, 1.0)` within the start position and finishes at `(19.0, 19.0)` within the goal position.
- It passes through the chosen breakpoint `(9.0, 0.36)`.
- The path segments are drawn in a manner that avoids all obstacles by maintaining a safe distance from their vertices.
- The path ensures that there is no direct crossing over any obstacle by planning strategic detours around them.

[08/20/2024 01:47:35 PM] To address the issue with the provided path where Segment 3 intersects with Obstacle 1, let's develop a new path that avoids the obstacles while ensuring the path starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and passes through one breakpoint.

### Analysis of the Spatial Situation:
- **Start Point**: The path begins at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start set.
- **Breakpoints**: The path needs to pass through one of the breakpoints in Breakpoint Set 1, either (9.0, 0.36) or (9.0, 16.9).
- **Obstacle Locations**:
  - **Obstacle 1** is positioned roughly between (10, 11) and (15, 14).
  - **Obstacle 2** and **Obstacle 3** are closer to the goal area.
  - **Obstacle 4** is somewhat isolated and lower.

### Path Strategy:
1. **Avoiding Obstacle 1**: 
   - Segment 3 currently intersects Obstacle 1. We need to adjust the middle section of the path.
   - Instead of going directly from (13.0, 6.0) to (12.5, 13.0), take a detour around the obstacle.

2. **Adjusting Segments**:
   - Using Breakpoint (9.0, 0.36) helps with navigation and avoids direct contact with Obstacle 1.
   - From (9.0, 0.36), navigate upward and around Obstacle 1 by choosing a point to the side.
   - After the detour, head towards the goal while avoiding other obstacles.

3. **Ensuring Validity**:
   - Ensure each segment between waypoints avoids passing through any obstacles.
   - Account for minimal distance between the path and the obstacles' edges.

### New Suggested Path:
Let's construct a path that adheres to the criteria:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start in the start set
    (9.0, 0.36),    # First breakpoint on the valid subpath
    (9.0, 10.0),    # Move upwards around Obstacle 1
    (11.0, 14.0),   # Bypass Obstacle 1 by going above
    (15.0, 16.0),   # Move towards the goal while avoiding Obstacle 3
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End in the goal set
]
```

### Explanation of the Path:
- **Segment from (9.0, 0.36) to (9.0, 10.0)**: This segment aims to rise above Obstacle 1 without intersecting it.
- **Segment from (9.0, 10.0) to (11.0, 14.0)**: Navigates around the north-west edge of Obstacle 1 by going further right and upwards.
- **Segment from (11.0, 14.0) to (15.0, 16.0)**: Safely moves around Obstacle 1 while ensuring no crossing.
- **Segment from (15.0, 16.0) to (19.0, 19.0)**: Finally, a direct shot to the goal avoiding any obstacles.

This adjusted path complies with all the criteria, moving safely through waypoint adjustments to bypass potential obstacle intersections.

[08/20/2024 01:47:44 PM] ### Analysis and Thought Process

The provided path successfully starts within the start set and ends within the goal set. However, the segment from (9.0, 0.36) to (9.0, 10.0) intersects Obstacle 4. This intersection must be resolved to ensure that the path is valid, avoiding all obstacles while fulfilling the requirement of visiting a breakpoint.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Obstacle Layout**:
   - **Obstacle 1** and **Obstacle 4** overlap certain coordinates that a linear vertical path from (9.0, 0.36) to (9.0, 10.0) follows, causing intersection.
   
2. **Breakpoint Set**:
   - We've used breakpoint (9.0, 0.36) of Breakpoint Set 1, which is valid. However, the choice of connecting directly to a higher vertical path hits an obstacle, specifically Obstacle 4. Thus, a redirection or vertical adjustment is necessary around obstacles.

#### Path Adjustment Strategy:
- **Adjust the 'problematic segment'**: We must reroute around Obstacle 4 or choose another appropriate vertical path or align via different breakpoints to safely avoid obstacles while eventually reaching goal set.
- **Experiment with in-between waypoints to steer clear of obstacles** by providing a pathway that positions away or around obstacle vertices while maintaining coverage of minimal sections that lie alongside obstacle quadrilaterals.

### Adjusted Path:

1. Start at a point within the start set: (1.0, 1.0).
2. Move towards the first breakpoint while staying clear of obstacle margins:
   - Approach (9.0, 0.36) as previously, which doesn't intersect with any obstacle initially.
3. **New waypoint** to provide clearance around Obstacle 4:
   - Proceed diagonally towards (8.0, 5.0) to circumvent direct paths crossing through the prohibited zone of Obstacle 4.
4. **Bypass the remainder of Obstacle 4**:
   - Extend from (8.0, 5.0) to (9.0, 11.0), a point that extends beyond Obstacle 4's bounds at a safe clear segment. This leads the path seemingly higher above to ensure it doesn't clip through obstacle vertices.
5. Next leading towards (15, 16) to smoothly align upward past all obstacle positions located below:
   - Approaching the goal set with clearance over past plotted obstacles.
6. Conclude towards a feasible endpoint within the goal quadrilateral:
   - Finalizing at (19.0, 19.0), as initially given, ensuring it safely lands within the goal confines.

### Revised Path
```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start
    (9.0, 0.36),  # Breakpoint
    (8.0, 5.0),   # New waypoint bypassing obstacles
    (9.0, 11.0),  # Safe bypass avoid Obstacle 4
    (15.0, 16.0), # Heading towards Goal, clearing other obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End in the goal set
]
```

This new path ensures a feasible route from start to goal, bypassing prior problematic engagements with Obstacle 4 by strategic insertion of safely calculated waypoints, maintaining smooth alignment with obstacle-free segments while fulfilling all constraints.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

[08/20/2024 01:47:55 PM] ### Chain of Thought

Analyzing the provided path and feedback, the segment between (8.0, 5.0) and (9.0, 11.0) intersects with Obstacle 4. To avoid this, I need to adjust this segment to circumvent the obstacle while still adhering to the path requirements. Additionally, I need to ensure that the path uses one of the breakpoints from the provided breakpoint set, which is correctly implemented in the original path.

### Analyzing the Spatial Layout

Given the position of Obstacle 4 with vertices [[10.3, 12.2], [6.8, 11.1], [9.4, 1.2], [11.3, 4.1]], navigating around this requires closely observing its layout:
- The obstacle extends horizontally from approximately x = 6.8 to x = 11.3, and vertically from y = 1.2 to y = 12.2.
- Our problematic segment (8.0, 5.0) to (9.0, 11.0) crosses through the middle of this obstacle.

### Obstacle Avoidance

1. **Determine a Detour:**
   - Since we have a valid waypoint at (8.0, 5.0) and need to avoid the obstacle, one strategy is to move slightly further away from the obstacle horizontally before ascending vertically.
   - Avoid intersection by creating a midpoint that goes around the obstacle's edge.

2. **Considering Breakpoints:**
   - Stick close to breakpoints which have been initially correct in a valid subpath.
   - Make use of Breakpoint Set 1: (9.0, 0.36) providing a reliable route reference.

### Path Adjustments

1. **From (8.0, 5.0), move leftwards and upwards:**
   - Transition from (8.0, 5.0) to a new position, say (7.0, 6.0), to sidestep Obstacle 4 more effectively.
   
2. **Then ascend past the top of the obstacle smoothly:**
   - Proceed to a safer zone at a higher y level without getting too close to Obstacle 4’s boundary.
   - Reach (9.5, 12.0) after avoiding the problematic area; imagining above the upper boundary.

3. **Continue towards the goal set from above:**
   - Finally, proceed towards the goal by way of (15.0, 16.0) and reach the endpoint of (19.0, 19.0), ensuring avoidance of the remaining obstacles.

### New Path

Following this approach, the suggested new path would be:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),          # Start in the correct start set.
    (9.0, 0.36),         # Passing through the first breakpoint.
    (8.0, 5.0),          # Valid continuation up to the valid subpath end.
    (7.0, 6.0),          # New route segment to sidestep below the obstacle.
    (9.5, 12.0),         # Safely passing above and away from the obstacle.
    (15.0, 16.0),        # Nearing the goal position, keeping clear.
    (19.0, 19.0)         # Finish in the goal set.
]
```

This path is adjusted to avoid intersecting obstacles while still passing through necessary points for a valid and successful path completion.

[08/20/2024 01:48:05 PM] To address the issue where the path intersects with Obstacle 4 between the waypoints (7.0, 6.0) and (9.5, 12.0), I need to adjust the path to avoid obstacles while maintaining a connection between the valid segments and ultimately reaching the goal set. Let's analyze and adjust the path:

1. **Understanding the Problematic Segment:**
   - The segment from (7.0, 6.0) to (9.5, 12.0) is found to intersect with Obstacle 4.
   - Observing the coordinates of Obstacle 4: [[10.3, 12.2], [6.8, 11.1], [9.4, 1.2], [11.3, 4.1]], the obstacle spans a region that overlaps with our path.

2. **Analyzing Spatial Relationships:**
   - The obstacle has a wide coverage both horizontally and vertically. It would be ideal to detour around it by moving below or navigating along the boundary of the obstacle.

3. **Adjusting the Path:**
   - Start from the valid subpath: [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 0.36), (8.0, 5.0), (7.0, 6.0)].
   - From (7.0, 6.0), attempt to move horizontally below Obstacle 4.
   - Avoid (6.8, 11.1) and navigate towards an area less congested by obstacles.
   - Reach the goal set maintaining distance from Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 2.

4. **Proposing a New Path:**
   - Ensure to pass through one of the breakpoints, and end in the goal set.

Here’s the suggested new path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),            # Start in the start set
    (9.0, 0.36),           # First breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1
    (8.0, 5.0),            # Avoid obstacles by moving vertically slightly
    (7.0, 6.0),            # Continue moving until a critical point
    (6.0, 9.5),            # Move upwards to maneuver around the left of Obstacle 4
    (8.0, 11.5),           # Navigate closer to avoid crossing Obstacle 4
    (11.0, 14.0),          # Move upwards staying clear of Obstacle 4
    (15.0, 16.3),          # Adjusted path to avoid Obstacle 3
    (19.0, 19.0)           # End inside the goal set, ensuring to avoid Obstacle 2
]
```

**Notes:**
- The revised path starts similarly but diverges around the obstacles with strategic vertical and horizontal movements.
- Careful consideration is given to ensure waypoints are clear of obstacles, both in terms of the boundaries and potential collision paths.
- The new path respects breakpoints and goal constraints provided and considers necessary detours around congested areas.

Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
new_path = [
    [0.5, 0.5], # start in the start set
    [0.0, 5.25], # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    [3.75, 5.25], # move rightwards to reach the gap
    [4.5, 4.5] # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/20/2024 01:48:18 PM] To successfully plan a path that meets all criteria, we need to re-evaluate the provided constraints and adjust the pathway to circumvent obstacles while passing through required breakpoints. Let’s break down the tasks:

### Analysis:
1. **Starting Point & Initial Path**:
   - The path starts from (1.0, 1.0), which is correct since it's inside the start quadrilateral.
   - The path initially progresses through the breakpoint (9.0, 0.36), which is good because it satisfies the need to pass through a breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1.

2. **Obstacle Interaction**:
   - The problematic segment is from (6.0, 9.5) to (8.0, 11.5), as it intersects with Obstacle 4 defined by vertices [[10.3, 12.2], [6.8, 11.1], [9.4, 1.2], [11.3, 4.1]].
   - To avoid this obstacle, any adjusted path should clearly steer away from this obstacle, potentially by moving below or to the right.

3. **Valid Subpath**:
   - The longest valid path from the start without intersection is [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 0.36), (8.0, 5.0), (7.0, 6.0), (6.0, 9.5)].
   - We need to build out from this path while ensuring no crossing with obstacles, including avoiding Obstacle 4 in subsequent moves.

### Path Adjustments:
To create a path that satisfies all required conditions without intersecting any obstacles, I propose the following steps and waypoints:

1. **Continue with Valid Path**:
   - Starting from the valid subpath and avoid the intersection with obstacles by rerouting after (6.0, 9.5).

2. **Bypass Obstacle 4**:
   - After (6.0, 9.5), move horizontally rather than diagonally towards (8.0, 11.5), as it's challenging with the proximity to the obstacle.
   - Move to (4.0, 10.0) to give a wide berth around Obstacle 4, navigating to avoid touching the area of overlap in the problematic region.

3. **Proceed to Final Goal Area**:
   - From (4.0, 10.0), make an upward curve to (7.0, 13.0) which is a safe segment.
   - Subsequently, from (7.0, 13.0) adjust to approach the goal without crossing any imaginary bounds of Obstacle 3.
   - Move to (10.0, 16.0), then curve inside the goal quadrilateral by finishing at a point in the goal area.
   - Finally, try reaching (19.0, 19.0) since it's already valid, or another entry like (18.5, 18.5) satisfying the endpoint condition.

### New Path Proposal:
After adjustments to ensure avoiding obstacles and fulfilling the path constraints, here is the adjusted path:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Starting point.
    (9.0, 0.36),  # Pass through a valid breakpoint set.
    (8.0, 5.0),  # Proceed with previous valid waypoint.
    (7.0, 6.0),  # Continuation of valid subpath before problematic segment.
    (6.0, 9.5),  # End of longest valid initial subpath.
    (4.0, 10.0),  # New waypoint to avoid intersection with Obstacle 4.
    (7.0, 13.0),  # Progress while avoiding obstacles.
    (10.0, 16.0),  # Move towards goal with clear path.
    (18.5, 18.5)  # Final waypoint inside the goal set.
]
```

This path avoids intersecting obstacles by using waypoints that maintain clear distances, meeting the starting, breakpoint, and goal conditions.
