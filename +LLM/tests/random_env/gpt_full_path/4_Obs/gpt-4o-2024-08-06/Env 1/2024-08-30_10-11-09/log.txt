# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[8.6, 17.6], [17.7, 16.1], [14.8, 18.1], [10.0, 19.6]]
			Obstacle 2: [[17.6, 18.6], [15.1, 19.5], [15.5, 16.6], [15.8, 16.1]]
			Obstacle 3: [[4.3, 15.5], [4.7, 15.2], [11.7, 17.0], [5.7, 16.6]]
			Obstacle 4: [[16.4, 19.0], [15.5, 17.7], [16.2, 15.5], [17.5, 14.3]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/30/2024 10:11:14 AM] To create a path from the given start quadrilateral to the goal quadrilateral while avoiding all obstacles, let's carefully assess the space between the obstacles and find a way that does not intersect them. Hereâ€™s a potential path outline:

1. **Starting Point:** Choose a point from the start quadrilateral. For simplicity, let's start at (1.0, 1.0), which is well within the start area.
   
2. **Navigating Around Obstacles:** The path needs to navigate around the obstacles without crossing them. We want to avoid obstacles which are located around coordinates (8.6, 17.6), (17.6, 18.6), (4.3, 15.5), and (16.4, 19.0). 

3. **Choosing Waypoints:**

   - Move eastwards initially, bypassing the first two obstacles on the northern side. You might choose to go to around (14.0, 3.0), which keeps you away from obstacle edges.
   - From there, we continue moving northeast, reaching a point like (17.0, 10.0), which remains safely clear of the obstacles.
   - Continue northeast further to (18.5, 15.0), an area positioned to the east of most obstacles.
   - Finally, enter the goal area. A point like (19.0, 19.0) safely fits within the goal quadrilateral.

4. **End Point:** This should be within the goal quadrilateral. Given the previous points, the end can be at (19.0, 19.0).

Here's the proposed path in waypoint format:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start in the start set
    (14.0, 3.0),   # Move east
    (17.0, 10.0),  # Continue northeast
    (18.5, 15.0),  # Further northeast near goal
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End in the goal set
]
```

This path ensures the waypoints follow a reasonable path between the defined start and goal areas while avoiding the obstacles. Adjustments can be made if a different detail level or precision is needed, but the current path maintains clearance from all given obstacles.
