# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[7.5, 17.4], [4.0, 15.1], [11.4, 15.2], [12.5, 16.5]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/30/2024 09:37:00 AM] To create a path that avoids the given obstacle and connects the start and goal areas, let's analyze the spatial relationships:

### Start and Goal Areas:
- **Start Area**: A quadrilateral defined by the points [[2.0, 2.0], [0.0, 2.0], [0.0, 0.0], [2.0, 0.0]]
- **Goal Area**: A quadrilateral defined by the points [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]

### Obstacle:
- **Obstacle 1**: A quadrilateral formed by the points [[7.5, 17.4], [4.0, 15.1], [11.4, 15.2], [12.5, 16.5]]

### Path Planning:

1. **Start Point**: We'll start within the start area. Let's select (1.0, 1.0), a central point in the start area.
  
2. **Pathway Analysis**: 
   - The obstacle is positioned to the right and slightly upwards from the start area.
   - Consider moving upwards and to the right around the obstacle to maintain a safe distance.

3. **Waypoints**: Choose waypoints that skirt around the obstacle while heading towards the goal area:
   - Starting from (1.0, 1.0)
   - Move upwards to provide distance from the obstacle: (1.0, 10.0)
   - Move diagonally right and upwards to circumvent the left side of the obstacle: (5.0, 17.0)
   - Proceed towards the goal: (16.0, 19.0), staying clear of the obstacle's right side.
   - End at a central point within the goal area, such as (19.0, 19.0).

### Proposed Path:
```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Starting within the start area
    (1.0, 10.0), # Moving upwards for safety clearance
    (5.0, 17.0), # Navigating upward and to the right of the obstacle
    (16.0, 19.0), # Moving towards the goal area avoiding the right side of the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Ending within the goal area
]
```

This path starts at a safe central point within the start area and ends centrally in the goal. The waypoints are chosen to sufficiently avoid the obstacle and provide a clear route through the available space.
