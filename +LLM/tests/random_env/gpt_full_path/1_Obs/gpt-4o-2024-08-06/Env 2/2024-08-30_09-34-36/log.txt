# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[19.0, 13.4], [17.5, 12.0], [18.2, 10.5], [19.6, 7.7]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/30/2024 09:34:46 AM] To create a path from the start quadrilateral to the goal quadrilateral while avoiding obstacles, let's analyze the given data:

### Provided Data
- **Start Position**: Quadrilateral with vertices \((2.0, 2.0)\), \((0.0, 2.0)\), \((0.0, 0.0)\), \((2.0, 0.0)\)
- **Goal Position**: Quadrilateral with vertices \((20.0, 20.0)\), \((18.0, 20.0)\), \((18.0, 18.0)\), \((20.0, 18.0)\)
- **Obstacle 1**: Quadrilateral with vertices \((19.0, 13.4)\), \((17.5, 12.0)\), \((18.2, 10.5)\), \((19.6, 7.7)\)

### Path Planning
1. **Starting Point**:
   - Choose a point within the start quadrilateral. Let's start at \((1.0, 1.0)\).

2. **Avoiding the Obstacle**:
   - The obstacle roughly lies between y-coordinates 7.7 and 13.4. Therefore, the path should either go above or below this range to avoid collision.
   - A straightforward approach is to go vertically up to a safe y-coordinate (e.g., above 13.4), and then head towards the goal.

3. **Ending Point**:
   - Choose a point within the goal quadrilateral that has a straightforward connection from the previous segment.

### Proposed Path:
- Start at \((1.0, 1.0)\)
- Move vertically up avoiding obstacle's upper boundary, for example to \((1.0, 14.0)\) 
- Move horizontally towards the goal area, for example to \((19.0, 14.0)\)
- Then straight into the goal, for example to \((19.0, 19.0)\)

#### Path Coordinates:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # start within the start quadrilateral
    (1.0, 14.0),   # move vertically up avoiding obstacle
    (19.0, 14.0),  # move horizontally past the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0),  # move into the goal quadrilateral
]
```

This path ensures there is a clear avoidance of the given obstacle while connecting the start and goal regions effectively.
