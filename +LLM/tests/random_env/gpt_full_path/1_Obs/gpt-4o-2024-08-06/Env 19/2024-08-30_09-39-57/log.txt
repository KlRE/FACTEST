# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[17.4, 12.7], [11.2, 13.1], [16.4, 10.6], [19.1, 9.4]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/30/2024 09:40:05 AM] ## Analysis of the Environment

### Start Position:
The start position is a quadrilateral with coordinates:
- Bottom-left: (0.0, 0.0)
- Bottom-right: (2.0, 0.0)
- Top-right: (2.0, 2.0)
- Top-left: (0.0, 2.0)

### Goal Position:
The goal position is a quadrilateral with coordinates:
- Bottom-left: (18.0, 18.0)
- Bottom-right: (20.0, 18.0)
- Top-right: (20.0, 20.0)
- Top-left: (18.0, 20.0)

### Obstacle:
There is one obstacle defined by the quadrilateral with vertices:
- (17.4, 12.7)
- (11.2, 13.1)
- (16.4, 10.6)
- (19.1, 9.4)

### Path Considerations:
- The path must start within the start quadrilateral and end within the goal quadrilateral.
- The obstacle needs to be avoided, ensuring the path does not intersect or touch it.
- A simple yet effective path should be chosen to ensure accuracy and fulfillment of the objectives.

## Path Planning
Given this setup, the path must avoid the obstacle while making its way from the start set to the goal set. Since the obstacle is quite wide horizontally, traversing below it where there's more vertical space seems practical.

### Proposed Path:
1. **Start Point**: (1.0, 1.0) within the start quadrilateral.
2. **Waypoint 1**: (3.0, 1.0) move right to bypass the start quadrant.
3. **Waypoint 2**: (10.0, 1.0) continue moving right, staying clear of the obstacle tabulated above.
4. **Waypoint 3**: (10.0, 17.0) move upwards taking a vertical corridor avoiding the obstacle.
5. **Waypoint 4**: (19.0, 17.0) move right towards the goal set, avoiding the lower edge of the obstacle.
6. **End Point**: (19.0, 19.0) within the goal quadrilateral.

### Conclusion:
This path strategically avoids the obstacle and adheres to the requirements of starting and ending within the defined regions. Each waypoint is selected to maintain the path within permissible zones without intersecting the obstacle.

## Proposed Path Array:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # start in the start set
    (3.0, 1.0),  # start horizontally aligning
    (10.0, 1.0), # bypassing lateral obstacles
    (10.0, 17.0),# vertical movement near goal
    (19.0, 17.0),# horizontal move into goal space
    (19.0, 19.0) # end in the goal set
]
```
The path maintains a clear trajectory from start to finish while effectively circumventing the obstacle, meeting the problem's constraints accurately.
