# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.6, 18.8], [6.3, 17.5], [13.9, 16.8], [19.0, 16.6]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/30/2024 09:37:41 AM] To plan a path from the given start position to the goal position while avoiding the specified obstacle, we need a path that strategically navigates through the environment without crossing into the area occupied by the obstacle. Given the start and goal are quadrilaterals, we’ll select appropriate points within these and create waypoints around the obstacle. 

### Analysis:
1. **Start Position**: The start can be any point within the quadrilateral [(2.0, 2.0), (0.0, 2.0), (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0)]. We can start near (1.0, 1.0), a central and strategic point for movement.
2. **Goal Position**: The goal can be any point within the quadrilateral [(20.0, 20.0), (18.0, 20.0), (18.0, 18.0), (20.0, 18.0)]. We’ll aim for around (19.0, 19.0).
3. **Obstacle Consideration**: The provided obstacle is a skewed quadrilateral but thankfully, there is decent space above it.

### Avoidance Strategy:
- Bypass above the obstacle, considering its vertices at (15.6, 18.8) to (13.9, 16.8), there's space to move safely above.

### New Path Plan:
1. **Start Point**: Let's start in the start area from a central point for easy maneuvering.
2. **Avoidance**: Create waypoints that move above and around the obstacle.
3. **End Point**: Finish at a central point in the goal area.

### Proposed Path:
- Start near the central point of the start set.
- Create a waypoint slightly above the maximum y-coordinate of the obstacle to ensure clearance.
- Smoothly transition towards the goal while maintaining a reasonable buffer above the obstacle.

### Path Coordinates:
```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # start inside the start area
    (5.0, 19.0), # move upward and right, ensuring to stay above the obstacle
    (10.0, 19.0), # continue along clear path over the obstacle
    (15.0, 19.0), # clear above the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)  # end inside the goal area
]
```

This path keeps a safe distance from the obstacle and follows a clear trajectory from start to goal within the given constraints.
