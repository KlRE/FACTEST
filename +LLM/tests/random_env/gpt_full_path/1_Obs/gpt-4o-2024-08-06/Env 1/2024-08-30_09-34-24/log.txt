# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[19.7, 15.4], [15.8, 13.4], [16.5, 10.8], [19.3, 9.8]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/30/2024 09:34:36 AM] To create a path that avoids the provided obstacle and meets the path requirements, we'll start by identifying a possible trajectory from the start position to the goal position while ensuring the path does not intersect the obstacle.

### Analysis:
- **Start Quadrilateral:** The start quadrilateral is defined by the vertices [[2.0, 2.0], [0.0, 2.0], [0.0, 0.0], [2.0, 0.0]]. We can select a starting point within this area, such as (1.0, 1.0) for ease.
- **Goal Quadrilateral:** The goal quadrilateral is defined by the vertices [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]. A convenient end point can be (19.0, 19.0).
- **Obstacle:** Obstacle 1 is defined by the vertices [[19.7, 15.4], [15.8, 13.4], [16.5, 10.8], [19.3, 9.8]]. We need to ensure that our path does not come close to these points.

### Path Proposal:
1. **Start Point:** Begin within the start quadrilateral, for example, at (1.0, 1.0).
2. **Intermediate Waypoints:** 
   - Move diagonally to the right and upwards towards the open space avoiding the obstacle, for example, go to (10, 10).
   - Curve slightly upwards to evade the obstacle, through a point like (14, 16), staying clear of the edges and the obstacle.
3. **End Point:** Finish at a point within the goal quadrilateral, e.g., (19.0, 19.0).

### New Path Waypoints:
The path can be represented by the following waypoints, ensuring the path remains at a safe distance from the obstacle:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start point within the start quadrilateral
    (10.0, 10.0), # Intermediate point to move diagonally up-right
    (14.0, 16.0), # Intermediate point to continue upward avoiding the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End point within the goal quadrilateral
]
```

This path allows for a smooth transition from start to goal, ensuring no crossing of the obstacle while keeping a reasonable distance from its vertices.
