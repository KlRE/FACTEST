# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[14.6, 14.1], [15.4, 10.7], [17.5, 6.5], [15.0, 13.1]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/30/2024 09:38:44 AM] To plan a path from the start set to the goal set while avoiding the obstacle, we need to choose waypoints that are safely inside the allowed areas and do not intersect with the given obstacles. Here is a feasible path:

**Analysis:**

1. **Start Position:** The start quadrilateral is bounded by vertices at coordinates \((2.0, 2.0), (0.0, 2.0), (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0)\). We can choose a point safely inside this area, such as \((1.0, 1.0)\).

2. **Obstacle:** The obstacle is defined by vertices \((14.6, 14.1), (15.4, 10.7), (17.5, 6.5), (15.0, 13.1)\). The path needs to avoid intersecting this area.

3. **Goal Position:** The goal quadrilateral is bounded by vertices at coordinates \((20.0, 20.0), (18.0, 20.0), (18.0, 18.0), (20.0, 18.0)\). A suitable endpoint in this area is \((19.0, 19.0)\).

**Path Planning:**

To avoid the obstacle, we need a path that moves around it. Here's a potential path:

- **Waypoint** at start position \((1.0, 1.0)\).
- Move in a generally diagonal direction to the top right, reaching around \((10.0, 5.0)\), which is far away from the obstacle's left side.
- Proceed further diagonally to \((14.0, 15.0)\), maneuvering north over the top edge of the obstacle.
- Finally, reach the goal set at \((19.0, 19.0)\).

**Resulting Path:**
```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # start inside the start quadrilateral
    (10.0, 5.0),   # move diagonally to a safe point
    (14.0, 15.0),  # move further diagonally north, avoiding the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)   # reach goal area within the goal quadrilateral
]
```

This path safely navigates around the obstacle without intersecting it, and adheres to start and goal area constraints.
