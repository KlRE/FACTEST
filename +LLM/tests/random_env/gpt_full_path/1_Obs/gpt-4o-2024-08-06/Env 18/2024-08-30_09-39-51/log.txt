# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[16.3, 2.9], [19.2, 13.0], [19.0, 14.7], [17.0, 8.3]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/30/2024 09:39:57 AM] To navigate from the start to the goal while avoiding the obstacle, we need to carefully select waypoints that keep a safe distance from the obstacle. Here's the analysis and proposed path:

### Analysis
- **Start Set**: The quadrilateral ranging from (0.0, 0.0) to (2.0, 2.0). We can pick a starting point somewhere inside, say (1.0, 1.0), which is central and easy to calculate from.
- **Goal Set**: Located far at the top right, from (18.0, 18.0) to (20.0, 20.0). Choose a point like (19.0, 19.0) which is centrally located in the goal area.
- **Obstacle**: Located between the path. It ranges roughly from just above y=2.9 up to near y=14.7 on the x-axis 16.3 to 19.2.

### Path Plan
The key is to maneuver around the obstacle. We'll start from the start point, navigate around the obstacle by adjusting height once past the x-coordinates where the obstacle is but keeping a wide berth to ensure no contact.

1. **Starting Point**: Begin at (1.0, 1.0), within the start set.
2. **Navigate Upward**: Move vertically up to clear the base of the obstacle:
   - Use (1.0, 3.0) to clear the lower range of the obstacle.
3. **Move Around the Obstacle**: Move along the x-axis to avoid the obstacle's far side:
   - Move to (16.0, 3.0) to ensure we're horizontally past the edge while maintaining vertical clearance.
4. **Final Ascent**: Move diagonally to enter the goal area:
   - Head to (19.0, 19.0), entering the goal set and staying clear of the obstacle on the left.

Here's the proposed non-crossing path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point within the start set
    (1.0, 3.0),    # Move vertically upward to clear obstacle height
    (16.0, 3.0),   # Navigate horizontally past the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Final approach into the goal set
]
```

This path ensures that the starting and ending points lie within their respective sets, avoids the obstacle, and provides a simple yet effective trajectory.
