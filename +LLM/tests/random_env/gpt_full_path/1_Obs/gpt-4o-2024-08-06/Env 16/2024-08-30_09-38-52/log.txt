# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[16.9, 17.4], [16.0, 17.9], [16.1, 16.1], [16.7, 13.1]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/30/2024 09:38:59 AM] Based on the provided data, we need to plan a path from the start set to the goal set while avoiding obstacles. Let's analyze the spatial layout and constraints:

### Provided Data
- **Start Position (Quadrilateral)**: [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
- **Goal Position (Quadrilateral)**: [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
- **Obstacle**: 
  - Obstacle 1: [[16.9, 17.4], [16.0, 17.9], [16.1, 16.1], [16.7, 13.1]]

### Analysis and Path Planning

1. **Start Point Selection**: We can start at any point within the given start set. Let's choose the center for simplicity: (1.0, 1.0).

2. **End Point Selection**: We can end at any point within the goal set. Again, choosing the center would be arbitrary but rational: (19.0, 19.0).

3. **Obstacle Avoidance**: The obstacle lies between x-coordinates 16.0 and 16.9, and y-coordinates 13.1 and 17.9. Thus, the path should either go above or below these coordinates.

### Path Proposal
Since the obstacle is closer to the goal than the start, we can plot a path that rises well above the highest y-coordinate of the obstacle and then descends into the goal set:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start from the center of the start set
    (1.0, 18.0), # Move vertically upwards, surpassing the highest point of the obstacle
    (19.0, 18.0), # Move horizontally to the right, staying above the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Move vertically upwards into the goal, choosing the center
]

This path moves up and over the obstacle, ensuring it does not come close to touching it, and finishes in the goal set.
