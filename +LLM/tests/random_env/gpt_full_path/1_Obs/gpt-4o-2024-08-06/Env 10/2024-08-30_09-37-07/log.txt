# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[16.9, 17.6], [10.9, 17.4], [11.6, 16.9], [13.3, 16.6]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/30/2024 09:37:17 AM] To determine a feasible path from the start set to the goal set while avoiding the obstacle, let's examine the provided coordinates.

### Provided Data

**Start Position (Quadrilateral):**
- Vertices: [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]

**Goal Position (Quadrilateral):**
- Vertices: [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]

**Obstacle 1 (Quadrilateral):**
- Vertices: [[16.9, 17.6], [10.9, 17.4], [11.6, 16.9], [13.3, 16.6]]

### Path Planning and Analysis

1. **Start Point Selection**: 
   - A point within the start set can be chosen, let's take (1.0, 1.0) as a starting point, which is centrally located.

2. **Goal Point Selection**:
   - Choose a point within the goal set, such as (19.0, 19.0), which is also centrally located.

3. **Obstacle Analysis**:
   - The obstacle is located mainly between x-coordinates 10.9 and 16.9 and y-coordinates 16.6 and 17.6. Therefore, itâ€™s essential to plan the path around this area without intersecting it.

4. **Path Waypoints**:
   - The path should initially move diagonally towards the goal, but while avoiding the obstacle, it needs to take a slight detour beneath or around it.

### Proposed Path

Based on the analysis, the following waypoints can be selected for an obstacle-avoiding smooth path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (5.0, 5.0),    # Move diagonally up and right
    (10.0, 10.0),  # Continue towards the general direction of the goal set without hitting obstacles
    (14.0, 14.0),  # Further progression
    (20.0, 16.0),  # Move towards the upper right, staying below the y-coordinate of the obstacle to avoid it
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set
]
```

### Considerations

- Ensure the path respects clearance rules as specified, maintaining a safe distance from the obstacle.
- The waypoints are chosen to create a clear path that avoids intersecting the obstacle while efficiently moving from the start to the goal set.
- Adjust these waypoints as necessary to incorporate additional constraints or clearance requirements.
