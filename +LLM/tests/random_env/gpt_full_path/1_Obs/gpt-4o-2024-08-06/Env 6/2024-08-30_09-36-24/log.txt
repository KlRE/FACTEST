# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[12.5, 16.7], [14.3, 16.3], [17.4, 18.8], [14.1, 17.9]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/30/2024 09:36:31 AM] To create a viable path for the given motion planning task, we'll start within the start set, navigate around the obstacle, and enter the goal set. Let's plan out the path:

### Analysis of the Environment
- **Start Quadrilateral**: The start set is defined by the vertices [[2.0, 2.0], [0.0, 2.0], [0.0, 0.0], [2.0, 0.0]]. We can choose a starting point within this quadrilateral, such as (1.0, 1.0).
  
- **Goal Quadrilateral**: The goal set is defined by the vertices [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]. We can choose an ending point within this set, such as (19.0, 19.0).

- **Obstacle**: The obstacle with vertices [[12.5, 16.7], [14.3, 16.3], [17.4, 18.8], [14.1, 17.9]] forms an irregular quadrilateral. We'll need to navigate around this while maintaining a safe distance.

### Path Planning
1. **Start at a Point in the Start Set**: Choose a starting point such as (1.0, 1.0).

2. **Waypoint 1**: Move diagonally towards the goal area, keeping a prudent distance from the observed obstacle. We can estimate a waypoint away from the obstacle's influence zone, such as (5.0, 5.0).

3. **Waypoint 2**: Continue the path further away from the obstacle upwards to avoid it, such as (10.0, 10.0).

4. **Waypoint 3**: Now that we are significantly past the starting area and away from the obstacle, adjust the path to move further right and diagonally upward again to (16.0, 16.0).

5. **Enter the Goal Area**: Finish in the goal set with a point such as (19.0, 19.0).

### Proposed New Path

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start point in the start set
    (5.0, 5.0),   # Move towards the center while avoiding obstacles
    (10.0, 10.0), # Continue moving diagonally upwards and right
    (16.0, 16.0), # Further adjust path to approach the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End point in the goal set
]

This path maintains a safe distance from the obstacle, starts in the start set, and ends within the goal set.
