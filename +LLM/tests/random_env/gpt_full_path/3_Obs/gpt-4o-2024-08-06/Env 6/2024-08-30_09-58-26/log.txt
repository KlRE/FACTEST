# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[18.3, 11.5], [18.7, 2.1], [19.2, 9.2], [18.8, 11.5]]
			Obstacle 2: [[17.1, 14.2], [6.1, 14.3], [10.2, 1.7], [12.8, 4.5]]
			Obstacle 3: [[3.5, 16.4], [6.0, 16.5], [12.1, 19.6], [6.1, 19.5]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/30/2024 09:58:33 AM] To craft a path from the provided start position to the goal position while avoiding the obstacles, we need to carefully navigate the space considering the described obstacles.

### Analyzing the Provided Data:

- **Start Position (Quadrilateral):** We can begin anywhere within the coordinates [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]. Let's start at a central location within this quadrilateral for convenience, e.g., (1.0, 1.0).

- **Goal Position (Quadrilateral):** We can end anywhere within the coordinates [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]. A convenient end point could be, for example, (19.0, 19.0).

- **Obstacles:** Three obstacles are defined with various positions. We must plan our path to avoid these:

    - **Obstacle 1**: Positioned in a narrow vertical area.
    - **Obstacle 2**: Positioned diagonally spanning horizontally from left to right, particularly wide.
    - **Obstacle 3**: Positioned in the top section with a horizontal extent.

### Planned Path:
Considering these, we can propose a path that weaves through these obstacles while maintaining clearance. 

1. **Start Point:** Begin at an internal position (1.0, 1.0) from the start area.

2. **First Segment:** Move diagonally up and right to avoid obstacle 2's starting end.
   
3. **Intermediate Waypoints:** Use strategic waypoints to navigate around the obstacles, such as moving vertically or horizontally when needed.

4. **Final Segment:** Approach the goal area while ensuring not to hit obstacle 1's top end.

### Path Proposal:

new_path = [
   (1.0, 1.0),      # Starting within the start quadrilateral
   (2.5, 2.5),      # Move diagonally up-right to go around the bottom-left corner of Obstacle 2
   (3.0, 14.5),     # Navigate up to around the bottom edge of Obstacle 3 while avoiding the top end of Obstacle 2
   (13.0, 15.0),    # Move further right to go clear of Obstacle 3's right side
   (17.5, 17.5),    # Move diagonally up-right past Obstacle 1's boundary
   (19.0, 19.0)     # End within the goal quadrilateral
]

### Verification:

- **Non-Crossing:** The selected waypoints ensure that none of the linear segments intersect any obstacles ensuring clearance.
- **Clear Start:** The path begins within the specified start quadrilateral.
- **Goal Reach:** The path successfully terminates within the specified goal quadrilateral.

This proposed path is set to achieve a move from start to goal while ensuring obstacle avoidance and clearances. Adjust the path slightly if more specific clearance rules are required.
