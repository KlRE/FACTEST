# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[19.4, 10.7], [17.7, 10.6], [18.5, 0.5], [19.7, 0.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[5.9, 3.7], [16.0, 1.2], [17.3, 6.8], [14.7, 7.9]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/30/2024 09:45:47 AM] To create a path that meets all the given constraints, we must start within the start quadrilateral, avoid intersecting or touching obstacles, and end within the goal quadrilateral. Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown of the problem followed by the proposed path:

### Analysis
1. **Start Quadrilateral**: Defined by the points [[2.0, 2.0], [0.0, 2.0], [0.0, 0.0], [2.0, 0.0]]. A suitable starting point could be directly in the center, for simplicity, e.g., (1.0, 1.0).

2. **Goal Quadrilateral**: Defined by the points [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]. Similarly, we can choose (19.0, 19.0) as the ending point.

3. **Obstacles**:
   - **Obstacle 1**: This obstacle is positioned towards the bottom-right section in the midpoint of start and goal quadrilateral. It takes more space towards x-direction.
   - **Obstacle 2**: This obstacle spans a larger area diagonally in the map and needs careful navigation.

### Path Planning
Due to the obstacles' positions and the clear open region that spans across the map, a viable path can be constructed by leveraging this clearance:

- Begin at the aforementioned start point within the start quadrilateral.
- Move diagonally upward-right to steer clear of Obstacle 2 and stay left of Obstacle 1.
- Reach the area safe to travel towards the goal quadrelateral avoiding the other side of Obstacle 1 as you proceed upward-right.
- End at the chosen goal point within the goal quadrilateral.

### Proposed Path
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Starting point within the start set
    (6.0, 5.0),   # Progress diagonally upward-right to clear space and start bypassing Obstacle 2
    (10.0, 10.0), # Continue moving towards the top safely right
    (15.0, 15.0), # Make sure the path doesn't come close to Obstacle 1 and continue upward right
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Ending point within the goal set as planned
]

This path takes a route providing clearances around obstacles, ensuring smooth navigation from the start to the goal.
