# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[19.8, 6.8], [15.8, 7.8], [16.2, 1.1], [18.9, 2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[17.7, 19.0], [5.6, 18.7], [7.5, 15.8], [15.0, 17.4]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/30/2024 09:46:39 AM] To create a path from the start position to the goal position while avoiding the obstacles, we can analyze the given coordinates and identify a set of waypoints that would ensure we maintain a sufficient distance from the obstacles. Here's a proposed path:

### Analysis
- **Start Quadrilateral**: Choose a point well within the start, such as (1.0, 1.0) for simplicity.
- **Goal Quadrilateral**: Choose a point well within the goal, such as (19.0, 19.0).
- **Obstacles**:
  - Obstacle 1 primarily spans lower y-coordinates, closer to the start quadrilateral. 
  - Obstacle 2 covers a wide range, primarily to the left of our direct path from start to goal, but there's ample room above it.

### Approach
- Begin from a point within the start quadrilateral.
- Ensure the path avoids obstacle 1 by exiting the start quadrant upwards, around its path.
- Once past obstacle 1, ensure to mark a wide berth around the right side of obstacle 2, utilizing available space above and around it.
- Finally enter into the goal quadrilateral from above or the side.

### Proposed Waypoints Path:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Starting within the start set
    (10.0, 3.0),   # Move to a point above obstacle 1 to avoid it safely
    (15.0, 10.0),  # Move diagonally towards the top of obstacle 2, staying clear of it
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Enter the goal quadrilateral from above
]
```

This path should successfully navigate from the start to the goal while avoiding obstacles. Each waypoint has been selected to ensure a clear, linear transition without intersecting any obstacle boundaries based on their provided coordinates.
