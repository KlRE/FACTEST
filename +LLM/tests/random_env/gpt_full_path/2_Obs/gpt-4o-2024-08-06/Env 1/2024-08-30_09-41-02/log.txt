# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[7.3, 18.1], [12.1, 16.7], [17.7, 19.8], [7.4, 19.2]]
			Obstacle 2: [[10.8, -0.0], [19.7, 0.1], [18.1, 14.4], [11.0, 4.7]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/30/2024 09:41:11 AM] To devise a path that starts within the defined Start Position, ends within the Goal Position, and avoids intersecting the obstacles, we can take the following approach:

### Provided Data
- **Start Position (Quadrilateral):** [[2.0, 2.0], [0.0, 2.0], [0.0, 0.0], [2.0, 0.0]]
- **Goal Position (Quadrilateral):** [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
- **Obstacles (Quadrilaterals):**
  - Obstacle 1: [[7.3, 18.1], [12.1, 16.7], [17.7, 19.8], [7.4, 19.2]]
  - Obstacle 2: [[10.8, 0.0], [19.7, 0.1], [18.1, 14.4], [11.0, 4.7]]

### Path Planning Strategy
1. **Identify Potential Start and Goal Points:**
   - Start Point: Choose a point well within the start quadrilateral, such as (1.0, 1.0).
   - Goal Point: Choose a point well within the goal quadrilateral, such as (19.0, 19.0).

2. **Understand the Space and Obstacle Layout:**
   - Obstacle 1 is situated towards the top-right of the plane.
   - Obstacle 2 extends from the near-bottom to roughly mid-height on the right, mostly aligned along a vertical path.
   
3. **Plan General Path:**
   - The path can typically go to the right (eastward) and slightly upwards (northward) to navigate around Obstacle 2.
   - It would initially stay low before ascending after clearing Obstacle 2's vertical extent.
   - Steer the path to avoid the lower portion and right side of Obstacle 1.

4. **Constructing the Path:**
   - Begin at the Start Point and plot a clear path avoiding the obstacles.

### Constructed Pathway

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start at a safe point within the start area
    (5.0, 1.0),      # Move right, staying clear of both obstacles initially
    (10.5, 1.0),     # Still move right, now nearing the lower boundary of Obstacle 2
    (10.5, 15.0),    # Move upwards (north) to clear the vertical extent of Obstacle 2
    (15.0, 17.5),    # Navigate between the space above Obstacle 2 and below Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 19.0)     # Finally, move towards a goal point within the goal area
]

### Path Validation
- Ensure each segment does not cross any obstacle.
- Validate the start and end points lie within the specified quadrilaterals for the start and the goal.

This path respects all constraints while avoiding the obstacles and ensuring a smooth transition from start to goal.
