# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[17.2, 12.5], [19.2, 10.4], [19.5, 14.6], [18.2, 16.6]]
			Obstacle 2: [[10.8, 10.7], [10.7, 1.1], [16.8, 0.6], [17.4, 7.7]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/30/2024 09:50:27 AM] To determine a path from the start position to the goal position while avoiding obstacles, let's first visualize the given environment. We have a start quadrilateral, a goal quadrilateral, and two obstacles.

### Analysis of the Environment:

1. **Start Position (Quadrilateral)**:
   - Defined by [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
   - This space covers a square area from (0, 0) to (2, 2). 
   - We can pick a convenient starting point within this range, such as the center: (1, 1).

2. **Goal Position (Quadrilateral)**:
   - Defined by [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
   - This area spans from (18, 18) to (20, 20).
   - We will aim to end close to the center; a good target point is (19, 19).

3. **Obstacles**:
   - **Obstacle 1**: [[17.2, 12.5], [19.2, 10.4], [19.5, 14.6], [18.2, 16.6]]
     - This is a slanted quadrilateral positioned between the start and goal.
   - **Obstacle 2**: [[10.8, 10.7], [10.7, 1.1], [16.8, 0.6], [17.4, 7.7]]
     - Another slanted quadrilateral located more towards the start region.

### Strategy for Path Planning:

- We'll select a path that steers clear of the areas occupied by the obstacles.
- The plan is to go initially north-east, avoiding Obstacle 2 by staying to its left and then heading north once we're aligned well to avoid Obstacle 1.

### Waypoints for the Path:

1. **Start** at point (1.0, 1.0) â€” a reasonable midpoint in the start quadrilateral.
2. Move to (1.0, 10.0) to ascend vertically, staying clear of Obstacle 2.
3. Move to (9.0, 10.0), after ascending, progress horizontally while ducking under the south edge of Obstacle 1.
4. Shift to (17.0, 17.0), diagonally heading towards the goal, ensuring we're past Obstacle 1.
5. **End** at point (19.0, 19.0), comfortably within the goal area.

### Proposed Path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (1.0, 10.0),
    (9.0, 10.0),
    (17.0, 17.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This path avoids the obstacles by steering around them in a straightforward manner, maintaining a safe distance from their bounds, and satisfies all defined requirements: starting from the start quadrilateral, ending in the goal quadrilateral, and not crossing any obstacles.
