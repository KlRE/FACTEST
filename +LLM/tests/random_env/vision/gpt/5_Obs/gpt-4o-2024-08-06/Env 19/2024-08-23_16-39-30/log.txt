# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

[08/23/2024 04:39:37 PM] To construct a path that adheres to the requirements, let’s explore the key points while ensuring the path avoids crossing any obstacles:

### Path Strategy
1. **Select Start and Goal Positions**:
   - Begin within the start quadrilateral and end within the goal quadrilateral.

2. **Choose Breakpoints**:
   - For the given breakpoint set, ensure the path moves through one of them.

3. **Avoid Obstacles**:
   - Navigate around obstacles while keeping a safe distance.

### Path Construction

1. **Starting Point**: Choose a point within the start position.
   - Let's start at (1.0, 1.0).

2. **Ending Point**: Choose a point within the goal position.
   - Target ending at (19.0, 19.0).

3. **Pass through Breakpoint**: Use one breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1.
   - Select (9.0, 7.03).

4. **Avoid Obstacles**: Navigate around the given obstacles (consider a higher-level path).

#### Proposed Waypoints

- **Start**: (1.0, 1.0)
- **Midpoint to Breakpoint**: (5.0, 1.0) - Move horizontally clear of nearest obstacles vertically.
- **Through Breakpoint**: (9.0, 7.03)
- **Navigate to Clear Path**: (12.0, 12.0) - Adjust to bypass obstacles.
- **To Goal**: (17.0, 17.0) - Close to the goal ensuring to avoid obstacles.
- **End at Goal**: (19.0, 19.0)

### Final Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    
    (5.0, 1.0),    
    (9.0, 7.03),   
    (12.0, 12.0),   
    (17.0, 17.0),   
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This path ensures that the starting and ending points remain within their respective quadrilaterals, a breakpoint is used, and obstacles are avoided.

[08/23/2024 04:39:45 PM] To adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles while meeting all requirements, such as passing through breakpoints and not crossing any obstacles, let’s revise the path based on the given environment:

### Analysis:

1. **Start and End Points**:
   - The start point is correctly inside the start set.
   - The end point successfully reaches the goal set.

2. **Current Path Issues**:
   - The segment from (9.0, 7.03) to (12.0, 12.0) intersects with Obstacle 2.

3. **Obstacle 2**:
   - Obstacle 2 is located around points [(9.3, 7.5), (13.6, 7.5), (13.5, 11.0), (10.0, 14.1)].
   - We'll need to adjust our path to bypass this obstacle.

4. **Breakpoint Consideration**:
   - The path currently goes through the breakpoint (9.0, 7.03), which we can maintain to satisfy the requirement.

### Path Revision:

1. **Start from the Start Set**:
   - Begin at (1.0, 1.0), moving toward the first breakpoint.

2. **Path Redirection**:
   - Alter the direction from (9.0, 7.03) to avoid hitting Obstacle 2 by detouring below or above it:
   - Use a waypoint to bypass Obstacle 2, such as moving slightly more horizontally and then vertically.

3. **End at the Goal Set**:
   - Choose a final segment that leads directly into the goal set without intersecting other obstacles.

### New Path Suggestion:

Using this strategy, here is the revised path:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start in the start set
    (5.0, 1.0),  # Proceed toward the breakpoint
    (9.0, 7.03), # Hit the required breakpoint
    (9.0, 11.5), # Move upwards to circumvent Obstacle 2
    (13.0, 15.0), # Move towards a clear area avoiding obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End in the goal set
]
```

### Summary:

- **Circumventing Obstacle 2**: Moved vertically and then diagonally to bypass the obstacle.
- **Maintained Requirements**: The path still starts in the start set, passes through the breakpoint, and ends in the goal set without intersecting any obstacles.

    - The path must go through one of the breakpoints in the set: (9.0, 7.03).
    - The segment (9.0, 11.5) to (13.0, 15.0) crosses over obstacles 2 and 3.

### Problematic Segment:
- The segment from (9.0, 11.5) to (13.0, 15.0) crosses through obstacles.

### Solution Strategy:

1. **Adjusting Problematic Segment**:
    - After reaching the breakpoint (9.0, 7.03), we need to avoid obstacle 2 and 3. We can add a waypoint that moves around these obstacles.

2. **New Waypoints**:
    - Continue from (9.0, 11.5).
    - Add a waypoint above the highest point of obstacle 2 and to the left of the starting edge of obstacle 3 to begin a detour.
    - The segment might look something like (11.0, 12.0) as a bypass point.
    - Continue towards the goal while ensuring further waypoints maintain a clearance from the obstacles.

### New Path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),          # Start in the start set
    (5.0, 1.0),          # Initial horizontal move
    (9.0, 7.03),         # Through first breakpoint
    (9.0, 11.5),         # Approaching obstacle
    (11.0, 12.0),        # Bypass around obstacles 2 and 3
    (15.0, 16.0),        # Clear path towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)         # End in the goal set
]

This adjusted path goes around the problematic segment, ensuring our waypoints deviate to bypass presented obstacles while heading towards the goal set.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.6, 15.9], [10.7, 16.1], [10.1, 18.5], [5.1, 17.7]]
			Obstacle 2: [[9.3, 7.5], [13.6, 7.5], [13.5, 11.0], [10.0, 14.1]]
			Obstacle 3: [[11.5, 14.4], [18.1, 1.5], [17.5, 7.3], [16.4, 12.5]]
			Obstacle 4: [[16.5, 12.8], [17.9, 10.7], [17.5, 11.6], [16.7, 13.2]]
			Obstacle 5: [[6.5, 16.5], [16.4, 17.7], [16.1, 18.4], [14.6, 19.8]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 7.03), (9.0, 20.16)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.0, 1.0), (5.0, 1.0), (9.0, 7.03), (9.0, 11.5), (11.0, 12.0), (15.0, 16.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 4 between points (9.0, 11.5) and (11.0, 12.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 2: [[9.3, 7.5], [13.6, 7.5], [13.5, 11.0], [10.0, 14.1]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(1.0, 1.0), (5.0, 1.0), (9.0, 7.03), (9.0, 11.5)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/23/2024 04:39:58 PM] To correct the path and avoid Obstacle 2, let’s analyze and adjust the current path plan:

### Current Path Review:
1. **Start to (9.0, 11.5):** This path is valid and avoids obstacles.
2. **(9.0, 11.5) to (11.0, 12.0):** This segment intersects Obstacle 2.

### Path Adjustment Strategy:
- **Avoid Intersection:** We need to bypass Obstacle 2, ensuring not to intersect it.
- **Use Breakpoints Wisely:** Adjust the path segments to go through the given breakpoint set and avoid close contact with obstacle boundaries.

### New Path Considerations:
- From (9.0, 11.5), continue horizontally to clear the y-coordinate boundary of Obstacle 2.
- Maneuver upwards and around Obstacle 2, maintaining a safe margin.
- Once cleared, head towards the goal set, making sure to avoid all other obstacles.

### New Path Proposal:
1. **Start at (1.0, 1.0)** – Within the start set.
2. **(5.0, 1.0)** – Direct move horizontally.
3. **(9.0, 7.03)** – Passing through Breakpoint Set 1.
4. **(9.0, 11.5)** – Valid segment.
5. **(9.5, 14.0)** – Navigate above Obstacle 2.
6. **(12.0, 15.0)** – Diagonal move towards a clear zone.
7. **(15.0, 17.0)** – Continue diagonally, ensuring no intersection.
8. **(19.0, 19.0)** – Reach the goal.

### Final Path:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (5.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 7.03),
    (9.0, 11.5),
    (9.5, 14.0),
    (12.0, 15.0),
    (15.0, 17.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This path respects all constraints and avoids obstacles by taking a wider path around them, ensuring safe passage to the goal set.
