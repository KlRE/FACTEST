# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[10.6, 17.4], [0.6, 19.3], [1.5, 17.5], [7.1, 15.9]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 7.36), (9.0, 19.85)]

## Provided Image

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

[08/23/2024 03:39:41 PM] To plan a path from the start set to the goal set, taking into consideration the provided obstacles and breakpoints while avoiding any collisions, let's define a potential route:

1. **Start Point**: Choose a point within the start set. Let's start at (1.0, 1.0), a central location within the start area.

2. **Breakpoint 1**: From the start, move towards the first breakpoint set. Choose the point (9.0, 7.36).

3. **Intermediate Waypoint**: Navigate around the obstacle, avoiding it by a margin. Use a waypoint such as (10.0, 17.0) to circumvent the obstacle safely on the right.

4. **Breakpoint 2**: From the intermediate waypoint, proceed to the second breakpoint (9.0, 19.85).

5. **End Point**: Finally, move to a point within the goal set, ideally near the center, like (19.0, 19.0).

Here is the path defined by these waypoints:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 7.36),   # Reach Breakpoint 1
    (10.0, 17.0),  # Intermediate waypoint avoiding the obstacle
    (9.0, 19.85),  # Reach Breakpoint 2
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set
]
```

This path avoids the obstacle and meets all the problem's requirements, including passing through the specified breakpoints.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[08/23/2024 03:39:47 PM] To adjust the path according to the feedback and avoid intersecting with the obstacle, let's analyze the spatial relationships and adjust the waypoints.

### Current Issues:
1. The path segment between points (10.0, 17.0) and (9.0, 19.85) intersects with Obstacle 1.
2. We need to ensure the path stays well clear of the obstacle.

### Plan:
1. Keep the initial segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (10.0, 17.0) valid since it's already clear of any obstacles.
2. From (10.0, 17.0), adjust the path to skirt around the obstacle while still moving toward the goal.
3. Use the breakpoint at (9.0, 19.85) since our path should pass through one breakpoint.
4. Approach the goal from a safer angle, maintaining a distance from Obstacle 1.

### Adjusted Path:
Here’s a new strategy to alter the path:

1. **Start at (1.0, 1.0)**: Inside the start quadrilateral.
2. **Move to (9.0, 7.36)**: Pass through the first set’s breakpoint.
3. **Skirt around the obstacle**:
    - **Move to (12.0, 16.5)**:
        This avoids crossing the obstacle. It shifts away from the path that intersects.
4. **Move toward (9.0, 19.85)**: 
    - Use this breakpoint to continue progressing north while maintaining proper obstacle clearance.
5. **End at (19.0, 19.0)**: Inside the goal quadrilateral.

### New Path:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 7.36),
    (12.0, 16.5),
    (9.0, 19.85),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

### Explanation:
- This path ensures we pass through necessary breakpoints while avoiding intersections with the obstacle.
- By adjusting the segment near the obstacle, it maintains a safer distance, preventing any crossing.
