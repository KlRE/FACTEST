# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 0.56), (5.12, 9.44)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.

[09/04/2024 06:23:12 PM] To create a path that meets the criteria, follow these guidelines:

1. **Start within the Start Set**: Choose a starting waypoint inside the blue quadrilateral.
2. **Avoid Obstacles**: Ensure the path does not intersect the red quadrilateral.
3. **Use Breakpoints**: Pass through one of the breakpoints.
4. **End within the Goal Set**: Conclude the path within the green quadrilateral.

### Path Plan

The given obstacle forms a diamond shape, and we start by strategizing a path that moves around it. It should exploit any available space while ensuring a smooth trajectory from start to goal.

#### Step-by-Step Path Calculation

1. **Starting Point**: Select a point within the Start Set.
2. **Intermediate Waypoint to Avoid the Obstacle**: Move around the obstacle's boundaries.
3. **Use Breakpoints**: Travel through one of the breakpoints, such as (5.12, 9.44).
4. **Goal Ending**: Select an endpoint within the Goal Set.

### Proposed Waypoints

\[ 
\begin{align*}
\text{new\_path} = & [ \\
    & (1.75, 1.75), & \text{# Start in the start set} \\
    & (1.75, 5.25), & \text{# Move vertically to go above the obstacle} \\
    & (5.12, 9.44), & \text{# Pass through the upper breakpoint} \\
    & (9.0, 9.0) & \text{# End within the goal set} \\
& ]
\end{align*}
\] 

This path ensures that the trajectory avoids obstacles, adheres to all waypoints, and meets the start and end conditions.

[09/04/2024 06:23:21 PM] ## Path Planning

To plan a path that meets all requirements:

1. **Starting Point**: Choose a point within the start set, e.g., (1.75, 1.75).
2. **Ending Point**: Choose a point within the goal set, e.g., (9.0, 9.0).
3. **Obstacle Avoidance**: Ensure the path avoids intersecting the obstacle.
4. **Breakpoints**: Use one of the breakpoints. I will choose (5.12, 9.44) as it’s closer to the goal set.

## Waypoints Proposal

Here's a simple path that adheres to the requirements:

- Start: (1.75, 1.75) 
- Move towards a safe passage to avoid the obstacle through the bottom left.
- Pass through the selected breakpoint.
- End: (9.0, 9.0)

## New Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start within the start set
    (5.12, 0.56),  # First breakpoint
    (5.12, 9.44),  # Second breakpoint
    (9.0, 9.0)     # End within the goal set
]
```

This path efficiently moves from the start set to the goal set while avoiding the obstacle and passing through one waypoint from each set of breakpoints.

[09/04/2024 06:23:30 PM] To create a valid path that avoids the obstacle while passing through a breakpoint, we need to adjust the initial path. Here's the revised plan:

### Analysis
1. **Start Point**: The starting waypoint (1.75, 1.75) lies correctly within the start quadrilateral.
2. **End Point**: The ending waypoint (9.0, 9.0) correctly falls within the goal set.
3. **Obstacle Intersections**: The segment between waypoints (5.12, 0.56) and (5.12, 9.44) intersects with the obstacle. We need to find a way around the obstacle.

### New Path Strategy
- Begin at the start point (1.75, 1.75).
- Move to Breakpoint (5.12, 0.56) to ensure we pass through this required point.
- Instead of going directly to (5.12, 9.44) which intersects the obstacle, move around it by taking a detour to avoid intersections.
- After circumventing the obstacle, move towards the goal set at (9.0, 9.0).

### Path Adjustment
1. **Waypoint 1**: (1.75, 1.75) - Start point.
2. **Waypoint 2**: (5.12, 0.56) - First breakpoint.
3. **Waypoint 3**: (7.0, 0.56) - Move right to bypass the obstacle.
4. **Waypoint 4**: (7.0, 9.0) - Move up, staying clear of obstacles.
5. **Waypoint 5**: (9.0, 9.0) - End within the goal set.

### New Path
By following this revised path, we avoid intersecting with the obstacle:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),
    (5.12, 0.56),
    (7.0, 0.56),
    (7.0, 9.0),
    (9.0, 9.0)
]
```

This path begins and ends in the correct regions, passes through the necessary breakpoint, and avoids intersecting any obstacles.

[09/04/2024 06:23:38 PM] ### Analysis and Path Adjustment

1. **Initial Path Review**: 
   - The original path starts in the correct start set and ends in the goal set. It also passes through one of the breakpoints in Breakpoint Set 1.
   - The third segment of the path between (7.0, 0.56) and (7.0, 9.0) intersects with the obstacle defined by the vertices [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]].

2. **Obstacle Avoidance**:
   - The issue arises because the vertical path from (7.0, 0.56) to (7.0, 9.0) crosses through the obstacle.
   - To resolve this, the path needs to be adjusted to bypass the obstacle completely while maintaining access to the goal set.

3. **Path Adjustment**:
   - **Continue**: From the valid waypoint (7.0, 0.56), move horizontally to the right to avoid the upper boundary of the obstacle.
   - **Additional Waypoints**: Add a waypoint close to the outer top-right side of the obstacle and then move along its perimeter towards the goal set.

4. **New Waypoints and Segments**:
   - From (7.0, 0.56), move to (9.0, 0.56) to reach past the horizontal boundary of the obstacle.
   - Move to (9.0, 8.5) to reach the vicinity of the goal set, ensuring this path does not intersect with the obstacle.
   - Finally, move to a point within the goal set, for example, (9.0, 9.0).


### New Path

The new path avoiding the obstacle is:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start in the start set
    (5.12, 0.56),  # Pass through Breakpoint Set 1
    (7.0, 0.56),   # Continue horizontally
    (9.0, 0.56),   # Move along the boundary safely past the obstacle
    (9.0, 8.5),    # Approach the goal set
    (9.0, 9.0)     # End inside the goal set
]

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

[09/04/2024 06:23:44 PM] To create a valid path that avoids the obstacle and meets the given criteria, let's analyze the spatial relationships and make the necessary adjustments:

### Current Issue:
- The segment between (9.0, 0.56) and (9.0, 8.5) intersects with the obstacle.

### Analysis and Path Adjustment:
1. **Starting Point and Initial Waypoints:**
   - Start at a point within the start quadrilateral, such as (1.75, 1.75).
   - Move to the valid breakpoint (5.12, 0.56).

2. **Obstacle Analysis:**
   - The obstacle forms a diamond shape with vertices at [(1.0, 5.0), (5.0, 1.0), (9.0, 5.0), (5.0, 9.0)].
   - To avoid intersecting the obstacle, adjust the path around the edges.

3. **Revised Path:**
   - After reaching (5.12, 0.56), move upwards to bypass the left edge of the diamond.
   - Adjust waypoints to ensure the path skirts around the obstacle without crossing.

4. **Complete Path:**
   - Carefully choose waypoints that avoid obstacle crossings while maintaining linear connections.

### Proposed Path:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start in the start set
    (5.12, 0.56),  # Breakpoint 1
    (5.12, 5.0),   # Move up along the left edge of the obstacle
    (9.0, 5.0),    # Skirt around the top edge of the obstacle
    (9.0, 8.5),    # Move vertically to the goal area
    (9.0, 9.0)     # End in the goal set
]
```

This revised path avoids the obstacle by navigating around its perimeter, ensuring no segments intersect the obstacle while passing through necessary breakpoints and reaching the goal set.

### Problematic Segment
The path segment from (5.12, 0.56) to (5.12, 5.0) intersects with Obstacle 1. This segment runs vertically through the obstacle, failing to avoid it properly.

### Valid Subpath
The valid subpath ends at (5.12, 0.56). From this point, we need to find a way around the obstacle without violating the constraints. 

### Obstacle Avoidance Strategy
To avoid Obstacle 1, we need to navigate around it. Considering the obstacle's shape:

1. **Explore Nearby Breakpoints:** Start at (1.75, 1.75) and initially go to (5.12, 0.56). 
2. **Navigate Around the Obstacle:** Move horizontally to avoid going through the obstacle.
3. **Rejoin the Path:** After bypassing the obstacle, find a path to the goal set.

## Revised Path

1. **Starting Point:** Choose a point within the start set: (1.75, 1.75)
2. **First Breakpoint:** Head to Breakpoint Set 1: (5.12, 0.56)
3. **Move Around Obstacle:** Move horizontally around the lower side of Obstacle 1: (7.0, 0.56)
4. **Proceed Towards Goal:** Go upwards and ensure not to touch the upper side of the obstacle: (8.5, 6.0)
5. **Reach the Goal Set:** Finally, reach within the goal set: (9.0, 9.0)

## New Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),    # Start in the start set
    (5.12, 0.56),    # Valid breakpoint from Set 1
    (7.0, 0.56),     # Navigate horizontally around the lower side of Obstacle
    (8.5, 6.0),      # Move upward, ensuring clearance
    (9.0, 9.0)       # End within the goal set
]
```

This path avoids the obstacle by taking a strategic route around it, while ensuring it passes through at least one breakpoint as required.

[09/04/2024 06:24:03 PM] ## Analysis and Thought Process

To correct the path and ensure it avoids crossing obstacles, let's analyze the current path and make necessary adjustments:

### Current Valid Subpath:
- The path correctly starts at (1.75, 1.75) and proceeds to the first breakpoint (5.12, 0.56).
- The next segment to (7.0, 0.56) is also valid.

### Problematic Segment:
- The segment from (7.0, 0.56) to (8.5, 6.0) intersects with Obstacle 1.

### Revised Path Planning:
- **Avoiding the Obstacle**: To avoid crossing Obstacle 1, we need to adjust the path around it. One approach is to navigate around either the top or the bottom side of the obstacle.
- **Ensuring Breakpoint Inclusion**: We must ensure the path goes through the necessary breakpoints, so we’ll keep Breakpoint Set 1 in mind.

### Path Adjustment:
1. Start at (1.75, 1.75).
2. Proceed to the first breakpoint (5.12, 0.56).
3. Move upwards, avoiding the obstacle by proceeding to a safe point, such as (5.12, 5.0), which is near the upper edge of Obstacle 1.
4. Continue horizontally to (9.0, 5.0), which skirts the top edge of the obstacle.
5. Finally, move upwards to reach a point within the goal set, such as (9.0, 9.0).

This adapted path will ensure the obstacle is avoided while maintaining a viable course to the goal.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 0.56), (5.12, 9.44)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.75, 1.75), (5.12, 0.56), (5.12, 5.0), (9.0, 5.0), (9.0, 9.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(1.75, 1.75), (5.12, 0.56)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[09/04/2024 06:24:11 PM] To devise a new path, let's analyze the environment and ensure that the path starts in the start set, passes through a breakpoint, avoids obstacles, and ends in the goal set.

### Current Path Issues
- The segment from (5.12, 0.56) to (5.12, 5.0) intersects with Obstacle 1.
  
### Strategy
1. **Start in the Start Set:** Begin with the valid initial point (1.75, 1.75).
2. **Choose an Alternate Breakpoint:** Since the path through (5.12, 0.56) intersects an obstacle, we'll try a different approach.
3. **Navigate Around the Obstacle:** Identify a path that avoids Obstacle 1, ensuring sufficient clearance.
4. **Head Toward the Goal Set:** Make sure the path ends within the goal set.

### Path Adjustment
1. **Start Point:** (1.75, 1.75)
2. **Move South East:** Head towards the open space and avoid the lower part of Obstacle 1.
3. **Waypoint 1:** (3.0, 1.75) to bypass the obstacle on the left side.
4. **Waypoint 2:** (7.0, 7.0) to move past the obstacle, heading towards the goal.
5. **End Point:** (9.0, 9.0) inside the goal set.

### New Path
Let's place the new waypoints to avoid the obstacle while adhering to the path requirements.

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),     # Start in the start set
    (3.0, 1.75),      # Move south-east, avoiding the obstacle
    (7.0, 7.0),       # Navigate further north-east towards the goal
    (9.0, 9.0)        # End in the goal set
]
```

This path should achieve all the requirements, avoiding obstacles and reaching the goal successfully.

1. **Current Path Issues:**
   - The segment between (3.0, 1.75) and (7.0, 7.0) intersects with Obstacle 1.
   - The path does not pass through a specified breakpoint.

2. **Obstacle Configuration:**
   - Obstacle 1 is a diamond-shaped quadrilateral. The path to avoid it should not cross inside this shape.

3. **Breakpoint Requirement:**
   - The path must pass through one of the breakpoints: (5.12, 0.56) or (5.12, 9.44).

4. **Path Reconstruction:**
   - Start within the start set at (1.75, 1.75).
   - Move towards and pass through the breakpoint (5.12, 0.56).
   - Continue from (5.12, 0.56) to (7.0, 1.75) to avoid Obstacle 1.
   - Finally, connect to a point within the goal set, such as (9.0, 9.0).

### Adjusted Path

To fulfill the requirements while avoiding obstacles and passing through a breakpoint, the proposed path is:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start point within the start set
    (5.12, 0.56),  # New waypoint at the required breakpoint
    (7.0, 1.75),   # Bypassing the obstacle while keeping safe distance
    (9.0, 9.0)     # Ending point within the goal set
]
```

This adjusted path starts in the start set, avoids the obstacle by rerouting through the breakpoint, and finally ends in the goal set.

[09/04/2024 06:24:28 PM] Let's analyze the provided scenario and adjust the path to avoid intersection with obstacles.

### Analysis

1. **Current Path Overview:**
   - The path starts at (1.75, 1.75), within the start set.
   - It passes through the breakpoint (5.12, 0.56).
   - The path then moves to (7.0, 1.75) but intersects with Obstacle 1 while attempting to reach (9.0, 9.0).

2. **Obstacle Analysis:**
   - Obstacle 1 is diamond-shaped, spanning from (1.0, 5.0) to (9.0, 5.0) and (5.0, 1.0) to (5.0, 9.0). This creates a central blocking area.

3. **Gap Identification:**
   - Observe that there is a clear space around the upper boundary that we can utilize. Also, a potential path could circumvent the upper part of the obstacle.

### Path Adjustment Strategy

- **New Start to Breakpoint Path:**
  - Start at (1.75, 1.75).
  - Maintain the valid segment from (1.75, 1.75) to (5.12, 0.56).

- **Adjusting the Path to Circumvent the Obstacle:**
  - Instead of going directly up from (5.12, 0.56), move upward to safely pass above the obstacle.
  - Proceed through a vertically safe path (considering potential y-coordinates) avoiding the obstacle's upper corners.

- **Goal Point Access:**
  - Once above the obstacle, head diagonally down to reach a point inside the goal set without touching the obstacle.

### Revised Path

After considering these aspects, the new path is formulated as follows:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),    # start point in the start set
    (5.12, 0.56),    # valid breakpoint
    (6.0, 7.0),      # safe path above Obstacle 1
    (8.75, 8.75)     # point inside the goal set

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

    Breakpoints:

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.75, 1.75), (5.12, 0.56), (6.0, 7.0), (8.75, 8.75)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(1.75, 1.75), (5.12, 0.56)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[09/04/2024 06:24:36 PM] To correct the path based on the feedback:

### Analysis

1. **Start and Goal Sets:**
   - The path correctly starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.

2. **Obstacle Avoidance:**
   - The segment from (5.12, 0.56) to (6.0, 7.0) intersects with the obstacle. This intersection needs correction.
   
3. **Given Breakpoints:**
   - We are required to pass through one of the breakpoints from Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 0.56), (5.12, 9.44)]. The option of 5.12, 0.56 intersects with the obstacle as per feedback, so let's verify a new path with a different route.

4. **Obstacle Characteristics:**
   - The shape and position of the obstacle suggest that we can navigate above or below it after passing the breakpoint.

### Path Adjustments

1. Start from a point within the start set (e.g., (1.75, 1.75)).

2. Use the breakpoint (5.12, 0.56) which was valid up to the obstacle intersection.

3. Adjust around the obstacle by moving linearly with a considerate distance from its edges:
   - Move towards a point that skirts the obstacle below: maybe around (5.2, 2.5) for clearance.

4. Continue upwards after bypassing the obstacle:
   - After clearing the obstacle, head toward a more central point closer to the goal, say (7.0, 8.5).

5. Move directly to a point within the goal set, e.g., near the middle or corner like (9.0, 9.0).

### New Path

The revised path avoiding the intersection, while still ensuring passage through a breakpoint, is:

``` 
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start point within start quadrilateral
    (5.12, 0.56),  # Breakpoint that was initially valid
    (5.2, 2.5),    # Skirt below the obstacle for clearance
    (7.0, 8.5),    # Clear obstacle heading towards goal
    (9.0, 9.0)     # End point within goal quadrilateral
]
```

This path follows a route with spatial awareness of the obstacle, ensuring no intersections occur and retaining direct paths otherwise.

[09/04/2024 06:24:45 PM] ### Thought Process

1. **Understanding the Environment and Feedback**: 
   - **Start Position**: It's correctly within the start set.
   - **End Position**: The end is correctly within the goal set.
   - **Obstacle Intersection**: The path segment between (5.12, 0.56) and (5.2, 2.5) intersects with Obstacle 1.

2. **Analyzing the Problematic Segment**:
   - The segment from (5.12, 0.56) to (5.2, 2.5) crosses the given obstacle, which is a quadrilateral defined by vertices [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]].
   - The obstacle lies partially in between these two points.

3. **Adjusting the Path for Obstacle Avoidance**:
   - To avoid the obstacle, choose a path around the obstacle that maintains a safe distance.
   - One potential approach is to reroute the path above or below the obstacle, depending on the clear space available.

### Path Revision

1. **Start with the Valid Subpath**:
   - Begin with the longest valid subpath: [(1.75, 1.75), (5.12, 0.56)].

2. **Reroute to Avoid Obstacle**:
   - Consider moving above the obstacle. Given the shape, a straightforward path could initially go horizontally, avoiding the bottom-left vertex, then upward once clear.

3. **Ensure the Path Passes through a Breakpoint**:
   - The initial valid path already includes the breakpoint (5.12, 0.56).

4. **Extend Path Towards Goal**:
   - Navigate around the obstacle towards a point closer to the goal, staying clear of obstacle edges.

### New Path Suggestions

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start within the start set
    (5.12, 0.56),  # Valid segment to the breakpoint
    (5.0, 5.5),    # Move above the obstacle, ensuring no intersection
    (7.0, 7.0),    # Clear path towards goal, away from obstacle edges
    (9.0, 9.0)     # End within the goal set
]
```

### Conclusion

By avoiding the problematic segment and creating a new path that circumvents the obstacle while maintaining the constraint of passing through a breakpoint, we ensure compliance with the motion planning task requirements.

[09/04/2024 06:24:54 PM] To adjust the path and avoid the obstacle, I'll analyze the spatial layout and the feedback provided. The goal is to ensure the path doesn't intersect the obstacles while satisfying the path requirements.

### Analysis

1. **Start and End Points**: The start and end points are correctly positioned within their respective sets.

2. **Initial Valid Path Segment**: The segment from the start point \((1.75, 1.75)\) to the first breakpoint \((5.12, 0.56)\) is valid.

3. **Invalid Segment**: The line segment from \((5.12, 0.56)\) to \((5.0, 5.5)\) crosses the obstacle. Therefore, we need to avoid this part.

4. **Obstacle Avoidance Strategy**:
    - We need to bypass the obstacle without crossing it. The obstacle is positioned roughly in the center of the environment.
    - A path through the second breakpoint might help, as it is likely positioned outside of the obstacle's area.

5. **Revised Path Plan**:
    - Start at \((1.75, 1.75)\).
    - Go to the first breakpoint \((5.12, 0.56)\).
    - Head towards a new waypoint, \((5.12, 6.0)\), that moves vertically beyond the obstacle.
    - Move towards a waypoint positioned north-east, avoiding direct segment crossing with the obstacle.
    - Finally, reach the goal at \((9.0, 9.0)\).

The new waypoints strategically avoid intersecting the obstacle:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Starting within the start set
    (5.12, 0.56),  # First breakpoint
    (5.12, 6.0),   # Move above the obstacle vertically
    (7.0, 8.0),    # NE to circumvent the obstacle
    (9.0, 9.0)     # Ending within the goal set
]
```

This new path ensures all constraints and criteria are met while effectively navigating around the given obstacle.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 0.56), (5.12, 9.44)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.75, 1.75), (5.12, 0.56), (5.12, 6.0), (7.0, 8.0), (9.0, 9.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:

    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[09/04/2024 06:25:03 PM] To adjust the path and avoid intersecting the obstacle, let's analyze and make necessary changes:

### Analysis:
1. **Start and Goal Locations:**
   - The start point is correctly within the blue start region (1.75, 1.75).
   - The goal point (9.0, 9.0) is correctly within the green goal region.
   
2. **Problematic Segment:**
   - The segment from (5.12, 0.56) to (5.12, 6.0) crosses through the red obstacle.
   
3. **Breakpoints:**
   - The path does pass through the breakpoint (5.12, 0.56), but needs adjustment to avoid the obstacle while maintaining a clear and valid path through the required breakpoints.

### Path Adjustment:
- We'll modify the path to go around the obstacle and still hit a valid breakpoint. We can adjust the path to swing around the lower side of the obstacle.

### Proposed Changes:
1. **Initial Path:**
   - Start at (1.75, 1.75).

2. **Revised Second Segment:**
   - Modify the second segment to avoid the obstacle:
   - From (5.12, 0.56), make a slight detour to avoid the obstacle and still go upwards.
   - Introduce a new point (5.0, 0.57) to swing around the obstacle's lower left corner, keeping clear.

3. **Move Towards Breakpoint:**
   - Continue to a new point past the obstacle (5.0, 6.0) and go towards (7.0, 8.0), staying clear of obstacle edges.

4. **Proceed to Goal:**
   - Finally, move towards (9.0, 9.0) to reach the goal region.

### New Path:
By making these adjustments:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),   # Start point
    (5.0, 0.57),    # New waypoint to avoid obstacle bottom corner
    (5.0, 6.0),     # Above obstacle
    (7.0, 8.0),     # Towards goal, avoiding obstacle edges
    (9.0, 9.0)      # Goal point
]
```

This new path should avoid crossing the obstacle while ensuring the correct start and goal positions and passing through the necessary breakpoints.

[09/04/2024 06:25:28 PM] To generate a new path that satisfies all requirements, let's analyze the provided data and consider adjustments:

### Analysis

1. **Start and Goal Sets**: 
   - Start: Center of the start quadrilateral can be approximated around (1.75, 1.75).
   - Goal: The goal point is within the green area, like (9.0, 9.0).

2. **Obstacles**: 
   - The obstacle, when visualized, covers an area primarily near the center of the environment stretching across a wide portion.

3. **Issues with Current Path**:
   - The second segment, (5.0, 0.57) to (5.0, 6.0), intersects with the obstacle.
   - The path does not pass through any breakpoints.

4. **Breakpoints**:
   - The path should pass through one of the breakpoints: (5.12, 0.56) or (5.12, 9.44).

### Path Adjustment Strategy

- **Avoiding the Obstacle**: 
  - Since the obstacle intersects the path vertically near the center, consider an early twist or upwards journey to avoid it and then rejoin vertically past the obstacle.
  
- **Using Breakpoints**:
  - Incorporate the available breakpoints. In this revision, we can use (5.12, 0.56).

- **New Path Construction**:
  - Start: Still from (1.75, 1.75).
  - Move to the first breakpoint while slightly avoiding the obstacle: (5.12, 0.56).
  - Navigate around the obstacle: (5.12, 6.5).
  - Approach the goal set: (9.0, 8.7).
  - End: Complete in the goal set at (9.0, 9.0).

### New Path Suggestion

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),     # Start in the start set
    (5.12, 0.56),     # Pass through the breakpoint
    (5.12, 6.5),      # Navigate around the obstacle
    (9.0, 8.7),       # Move towards the goal while avoiding
    (9.0, 9.0)        # End in the goal set
]
```

This revised path adjusts for the intersection with the obstacle, incorporates a breakpoint, and still reaches the goal set effectively.

- The segment from (5.12, 0.56) to (5.12, 6.5) crosses the obstacle.

### Path Adjustment Strategy

1. **Reroute Around Obstacle**:
   - Since the obstacle is a diamond shape, we can skirt along the edge while maintaining a safe distance. 
   - Add a waypoint that avoids the region occupied by the obstacle.

2. **New Path Proposal**:
   - Start from the initial valid segment and introduce a waypoint at the top or bottom of the obstacle.

### New Path

- From the previous end of the valid path, we'll adjust the path:

new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),       # Start Point: within start set
    (5.12, 0.56),       # Breakpoint Passed
    (6.5, 2.0),         # New Adjusted Point: skirt the lower edge of the obstacle
    (9.0, 8.7),         # Same point to approach the goal
    (9.0, 9.0)          # End Point: within goal set
]

This path avoids the obstacle by skirting around it, maintains the required breakpoint passage, and ends in the goal set. Additionally, the path is continuous and linear, adhering to all requirements.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

[09/04/2024 06:25:43 PM] ### Analysis

1. **Current Path Issues**:
   - The segment from (6.5, 2.0) to (9.0, 8.7) intersects with the obstacle, which is a diamond-shaped quadrilateral. Thus, this segment needs to be altered to avoid crossing the obstacle.

2. **Obstacle Avoidance**:
   - To avoid the obstacle, we need to find an alternative route that either goes around it or passes through a safe breakpoint.

3. **Potential Solutions**:
   - Use the valid path up to (6.5, 2.0) and reroute:
     - Consider moving upward along the boundary of the obstacle.
     - Ensure the new path continues to pass through a breakpoint.

### Path Adjustment

- **Start Point**: (1.75, 1.75)
- **Breakpoint**: (5.12, 0.56) – maintaining this from the valid subpath.
- **New Waypoints**:
  1. (6.5, 2.0) – Current endpoint of the valid path and starting point of adjustment.
  2. (6.5, 5.0) – Move upwards along the line at x=6.5, just touching the upper side of the obstacle.
  3. (8.0, 8.5) – Progress diagonally towards the goal set safely avoiding the top-right of the obstacle.
  4. (9.0, 9.0) – Ending within the goal set.

### New Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),
    (5.12, 0.56),
    (6.5, 2.0),
    (6.5, 5.0),
    (8.0, 8.5),
    (9.0, 9.0)
]
```

- **Explanation**: This path begins in the start set and, leveraging the original valid subpath, ensures movement upwards and around the obstacle without crossing it. The path ends in the goal set, maintaining adequate distance from the obstacle while ensuring a smooth and safe passage.

[09/04/2024 06:25:52 PM] ### Thought Process

1. **Start and Endpoint Validation:**
   - The path starts at (1.75, 1.75) within the start set and ends at (9.0, 9.0) in the goal set, which is correct.
   
2. **Connecting Through Breakpoints:**
   - The path successfully goes through a breakpoint at (5.12, 0.56).

3. **Obstacle Analysis:**
   - Segment (6.5, 2.0) to (6.5, 5.0) intersects Obstacle 1.
   - The obstacle is a diamond shape located roughly in the middle of the diagram.
   
4. **Adjusting the Path:**
   - To avoid the obstacle, I’ll need to reroute the path such that it goes around the diamond shape.

### New Path Plan

1. **Maintain Valid Subpath:**
   - Start at (1.75, 1.75), and use the existing path up to (6.5, 2.0), passing through (5.12, 0.56).

2. **Bypass the Obstacle:**
   - Instead of moving directly to (6.5, 5.0), detour around the obstacle.
   - Move towards (6.0, 2.5) to stay clear of the obstacle's edge.
   - Continue to (8.0, 5.5), staying on the side to avoid crossing the obstacle.

3. **Reach the Goal:**
   - From (8.0, 5.5), proceed to (9.0, 9.0) ensuring the path enters the goal set.

### New Path

new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75), # Start in the start set
    (5.12, 0.56), # Pass through the first breakpoint
    (6.5, 2.0), # Continue without intersecting
    (6.0, 2.5), # Adjust to bypass the obstacle
    (8.0, 5.5), # Progress towards the goal avoiding obstacles
    (9.0, 9.0) # End in the goal set within boundaries
]

This path should avoid intersecting with the obstacle while satisfying all other conditions and requirements.

3. The segment between (6.5, 2.0) and (6.0, 2.5) intersects with Obstacle 1, necessitating a reroute.
4. The path also ends correctly within the goal set at (9.0, 9.0).

**Obstacle Avoidance:**
1. To avoid intersection, the path needs to steer clear of the obstacle boundaries by an adequate margin.
2. Adding waypoints just outside the obstacle's perimeter can help navigate around it safely.

**Breakpoints:**
- The path must pass through at least one breakpoint. Since it already passes through (5.12, 0.56), this condition is met.

### New Path Proposal
1. **Start Point:** Begin at (1.75, 1.75).
2. **Move to Breakpoint:** Head towards and pass through the breakpoint (5.12, 0.56).
3. **Detour Around Obstacle:** 
   - Instead of heading directly from (6.5, 2.0) to (6.0, 2.5), curve the path:
   - Move to (5.5, 2.0) to skirt along the lower edge of the obstacle.
   - Next, navigate to (6.5, 3.5), positioning the path safely outside of the obstacle’s boundary.
4. **Towards Goal:**
   - Proceed to (8.5, 7.5), keeping a clear path towards the goal.
   - End at (9.0, 9.0) within the goal set.

### Final Path
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start in the start set
    (5.12, 0.56),  # Breakpoint
    (5.5, 2.0),    # Adjusted waypoint to avoid obstacle
    (6.5, 3.5),    # Detour to steer clear of the obstacle
    (8.5, 7.5),    # Steer towards the goal
    (9.0, 9.0)     # End in the goal set
]

This path complies with the path requirements, ensuring avoidance of obstacles and the correct start and goal locations, while retaining a defined route through the necessary breakpoints.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

[09/04/2024 06:26:11 PM] To adjust the path and avoid intersecting the obstacle, I’ll start with the valid subpath, then carefully plan around the obstacle while adhering to the path requirements.

### Analysis and Adjustments:

1. **Start Point**: The path starts correctly within the start set at (1.75, 1.75).

2. **Breakpoint**: The path passes through a valid breakpoint at (5.12, 0.56) without issues.

3. **Obstacle Intersection**: The segment between (5.12, 0.56) and (5.5, 2.0) intersects with Obstacle 1. This requires adjusting our path around the obstacle.

4. **Path to Avoid Obstacle**:
   - From (5.12, 0.56), instead of heading towards (5.5, 2.0), I will guide the path upwards and around the top part of the obstacle, ensuring there is no intersection.
   
5. **Proposed New Waypoints**:
   - From (5.12, 0.56), move vertically up, avoiding the left side of the obstacle.
   - Create a waypoint just above the obstacle, perhaps at (5.12, 5.5).
   - Then, proceed horizontally to another safe point, like (9.0, 5.5), staying clear above the obstacle.
   - Finally, make your way to the final destination within the goal set, (9.0, 9.0), ensuring no intersection at any segment by staying to the perimeter of the obstacle.

### New Path

new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start in the start set
    (5.12, 0.56),  # Valid breakpoint
    (5.12, 5.5),   # Move upwards avoiding the obstacle to a safe height
    (9.0, 5.5),    # Move right above the obstacle
    (9.0, 9.0)     # End in the goal set, in a clear path
]

This proposed path avoids crossing the obstacle and satisfies all path requirements.

[09/04/2024 06:26:21 PM] To create a valid path that avoids intersecting the obstacle while ensuring it passes through a breakpoint, let's analyze the environment and refine the path from the valid subpath.

### Analysis:
1. **Starting Point and Initial Segment:**
   - The starting point of the path is (1.75, 1.75), which is valid and within the start set.
   - The next segment is from (1.75, 1.75) to (5.12, 0.56), which passes through Breakpoint Set 1. This segment is valid.

2. **Problematic Segment:**
   - The segment from (5.12, 0.56) to (5.12, 5.5) intersects with the obstacle. We need to navigate around the obstacle.

3. **Obstacle Avoidance:**
   - The obstacle forms a diamond shape, and the points (5.0, 1.0) and (5.0, 5.0) form its horizontal extremes.
   - To avoid the obstacle, we need to bypass it with waypoints that go around these limiting coordinates.

### Path Adjustment:
1. Start at (1.75, 1.75).
2. Proceed to (5.12, 0.56) through Breakpoint Set 1.
3. Navigate around the obstacle:
   - Move to (4.5, 2.0), staying clear of the lower left edge of the obstacle.
   - Then move to (5.0, 9.44), which is high enough to clear the top edge and coincides with Breakpoint Set 1.
   - Move to (8.5, 9.0) to approach the goal.
4. End at (9.0, 9.0) within the goal set.

### New Path:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start in the start set
    (5.12, 0.56),  # Move to Breakpoint Set 1
    (4.5, 2.0),    # Navigate around the obstacle
    (5.0, 9.44),   # Move through Breakpoint Set 1
    (8.5, 9.0),    # Approach the goal
    (9.0, 9.0)     # End in the goal set
]
```
This path avoids intersecting the obstacle and meets all path requirements, while passing through the designated breakpoints.

[09/04/2024 06:26:32 PM] To address the problem, I'll analyze the current path and make necessary adjustments to ensure it avoids crossing obstacles:

### Analysis of Environment
- **Start Position:** Within the bottom-left blue quadrilateral: [(2.0, 2.0), (1.5, 2.0), (1.5, 1.5), (2.0, 1.5)]
- **Goal Position:** Within the top-right green quadrilateral: [(9.5, 9.5), (8.5, 9.5), (8.5, 8.5), (9.5, 8.5)]
- **Obstacle:** A diamond-shaped red quadrilateral in the center: [(1.0, 5.0), (5.0, 1.0), (9.0, 5.0), (5.0, 9.0)]
- **Breakpoints:**
  - Set 1: (5.12, 0.56)
  - Set 2: (5.12, 9.44)

### Current Path Issues
- The segment from (5.12, 0.56) to (4.5, 2.0) crosses through the obstacle.
- The path currently goes almost directly through the middle of the obstacle.

### Plan for Adjustments
1. **Starting the Path:**
   - Begin at (1.75, 1.75), a point within the start position.

2. **Use the Breakpoints:**
   - Move to the first breakpoint, (5.12, 0.56), but adjust the direction after this to avoid the obstacle.

3. **Avoiding the Obstacle:**
   - Navigate around the obstacle by choosing waypoints outside the boundary of the obstacle.
   - Consider moving above the obstacle instead of passing through the middle.

4. **Reaching the Goal:**
   - After avoiding the obstacle, head towards a point within the goal region.

### Suggested New Path
Adjusting the waypoints to skirt around the edges of the obstacle and ensure the path remains valid:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),      # Start in the start set
    (5.12, 0.56),      # First breakpoint
    (6.0, 2.0),        # Move upwards to avoid the obstacle
    (8.0, 6.0),        # Continue moving diagonally to clear the top edge of obstacle
    (9.0, 8.5)         # End in the goal set
]
```

### Summary
The proposed new path starts at the valid point within the start region, passes through the first breakpoint, avoids the obstacle by moving upwards, and ends in the goal region. The path ensures all requirements are met while avoiding intersections with any obstacles.
