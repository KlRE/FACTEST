# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.

		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

[08/23/2024 01:25:33 PM] The initial path goes straight up at x = 10, which causes collisions with multiple obstacles. We can instead utilize the provided breakpoint at (9.0, 20.53) to navigate around the obstacles.

Here's an updated path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0),   # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 2.0),   # Move horizontally to the breakpoint's x-coordinate
    (9.0, 20.53),  # Move vertically to the breakpoint
    (19.0, 20.53), # Move horizontally to the goal set's x-coordinate
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move vertically to end within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Start:** Begin at (1.0, 2.0), inside the start set.
2. **Horizontal Movement:** Move horizontally to the right, reaching x = 9.0, aligning with the breakpoint.
3. **Vertical Movement:** Move vertically upwards to reach the breakpoint (9.0, 20.53). This avoids all obstacles.
4. **Goal Approach:** Move horizontally to the right, reaching the x-coordinate of the goal set (x = 19.0).
5. **Goal Arrival:**  Move vertically downwards to reach a point within the goal set, (19.0, 19.0).

This revised path successfully avoids all obstacles and leverages the provided breakpoint to navigate to the goal set.

[08/23/2024 01:26:02 PM] The path needs to navigate around obstacles 1 and 4 to reach the upper section of the environment. It can achieve this by moving to the right and then upwards.
To avoid a collision with obstacle 1, the path should stay clear of its leftmost vertex at (5.6, 19.2). A safe passage can be found by aiming for a point to the right, such as (9.0, 6.0), and then going up to (9.0, 20.53). From there, the path can proceed horizontally to the right and reach the goal set without encountering further obstacles.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
