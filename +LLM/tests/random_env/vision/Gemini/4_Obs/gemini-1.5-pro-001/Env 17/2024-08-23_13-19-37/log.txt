# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[18.9, 12.3], [6.5, 2.5], [7.1, 2.0], [14.7, 3.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[12.7, 10.4], [19.9, 11.6], [15.7, 18.3], [14.6, 18.9]]
			Obstacle 3: [[17.8, 13.7], [13.8, 9.5], [14.3, 6.6], [18.0, 1.6]]
			Obstacle 4: [[11.1, 5.3], [19.1, 9.0], [14.1, 13.9], [12.4, 14.8]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 0.12), (9.0, 13.24)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[08/23/2024 01:20:06 PM] The current path collides with obstacles 2 and 4. To circumvent these, the path needs adjustments. 

* **Adjusting after valid subpath:** From the last valid waypoint (9.0, 13.24), we need to navigate around obstacles 2 and 4. 
* **Identifying safe passage:** There's a clear passage below obstacle 2 and to the right of obstacle 4.
* **Choosing new waypoints:** 
    * We can navigate downwards to (9.0, 8.0) to safely go below obstacle 2.
    * Then, move right towards (16.0, 8.0), staying clear of obstacle 4.
    * Finally, proceed upwards to the goal at (19.0, 19.0).

Here's the adjusted path:

[08/23/2024 01:20:13 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid obstacles. One approach is to route the path below the obstacles.

We can start from the valid subpath: [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 13.24), (9.0, 8.0)]. To avoid the obstacles, we need to go below them. Therefore, from (9.0, 8.0), we can move further down to a y-coordinate of 4.0 to be safely below the lowest obstacle point.  Then, we can move right towards the goal, passing above obstacle 1 and below obstacle 3. Finally, we can move up to reach the goal set. 

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, 13.24), 
    (9.0, 8.0),

## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[18.9, 12.3], [6.5, 2.5], [7.1, 2.0], [14.7, 3.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[12.7, 10.4], [19.9, 11.6], [15.7, 18.3], [14.6, 18.9]]
			Obstacle 3: [[17.8, 13.7], [13.8, 9.5], [14.3, 6.6], [18.0, 1.6]]
			Obstacle 4: [[11.1, 5.3], [19.1, 9.0], [14.1, 13.9], [12.4, 14.8]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 0.12), (9.0, 13.24)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 13.24), (9.0, 8.0), (9.0, 4.0), (16.0, 4.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 3 between points (9.0, 8.0) and (9.0, 4.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 1: [[18.9, 12.3], [6.5, 2.5], [7.1, 2.0], [14.7, 3.0]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 13.24), (9.0, 8.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

[08/23/2024 01:20:18 PM] The path needs to navigate around obstacle 1. We can do this by going below it, which also allows us to use the lower breakpoint of breakpoint set 1. 

From the breakpoint, a straight line to the goal intersects with obstacle 3, so we need an additional waypoint to avoid it. Moving to the right and slightly downwards before going to the goal avoids all obstacles.
