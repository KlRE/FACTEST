# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

[08/23/2024 01:15:24 PM] The current path got stuck after successfully navigating to the breakpoint (9.0, 11.81). It seems like the obstacles occupy a significant portion of the space above y = 12, making it difficult to find a path above them. 

Therefore, we can aim to find a path that goes below all the obstacles. Observing the map, there's a clear path if we first move to the right and then upwards.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 1.9),   # Move right to the first breakpoint, staying below obstacles
    (17.5, 1.9),  # Continue moving right, staying below obstacles

[08/23/2024 01:15:30 PM] The current path collides with Obstacle 4 because it tries to move to the goal in a straight line. We can avoid this by going around Obstacle 4. 

First, we can leverage the breakpoint (9.0, 19.51) from Breakpoint Set 1, which is clear of any obstacles. 

Then, we can move rightward, going around Obstacle 4 while staying clear of its vertices. 

Finally, we can connect to the goal set.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
