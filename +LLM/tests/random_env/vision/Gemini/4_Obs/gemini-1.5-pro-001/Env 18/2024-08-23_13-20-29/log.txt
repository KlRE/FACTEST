# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

[08/23/2024 01:20:56 PM] The initial path crosses Obstacles 1 and 4. It appears that going above Obstacle 1 is necessary given the placement of Obstacle 4.  We will aim to use the breakpoint (9.0, 19.8) to route the path above the obstacles and then towards the goal. Here's a possible adjusted path:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (1.0, 18.5),  # Move upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 4
    (9.0, 19.8),  # Pass through Breakpoint Set 1
    (16.0, 19.8), # Move right, staying above Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(1.0, 1.0) to (1.0, 18.5):**  This segment moves directly upward, staying within the corridor between Obstacle 4 on the right and the start set boundary on the left.
2. **(1.0, 18.5) to (9.0, 19.8):** This segment connects to the breakpoint, staying above Obstacle 1.
3. **(9.0, 19.8) to (16.0, 19.8):** This segment moves horizontally above Obstacles 1 and 2.
4. **(16.0, 19.8) to (19.0, 19.0):**  This final segment moves slightly down and to the right to reach the goal set, avoiding Obstacle 3.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:

[08/23/2024 01:21:11 PM] The initial path was invalidated by obstacles 1 and 4. To proceed, we'll adjust the path to navigate around these obstacles.

1. **Valid Subpath:** The provided feedback indicates that the subpath [(1.0, 1.0), (5.5, 1.0)] is valid. Let's continue from there.
2. **Avoiding Obstacle 1:** Obstacle 1 occupies a significant portion of the y-axis between approximately y = 10 and y = 18. To circumvent this, we can guide the path above it.
3. **Breakpoint Set 1:** We need to incorporate one of the breakpoints from Breakpoint Set 1. The upper breakpoint (9.0, 19.8) is a suitable choice as it lies above Obstacle 1 and allows for a clear path forward.
4. **Towards the Goal:** From the breakpoint (9.0, 19.8), we can move horizontally towards the goal set.
5. **Final Approach:** Finally, a slight downward adjustment will lead us directly into the goal set.

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (5.5, 1.0), 
    (5.5, 19.0),

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
