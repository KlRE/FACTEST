# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[0.3, 19.0], [4.0, 15.3], [14.3, 11.2], [12.9, 13.3]]
			Obstacle 2: [[11.6, 14.7], [8.4, 5.4], [11.4, 0.9], [17.1, 11.1]]

			Obstacle 4: [[11.2, 12.5], [11.4, 6.6], [15.0, 0.2], [14.8, 3.2]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 1.25), (9.0, 10.22), (9.0, 18.53)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

[08/23/2024 01:13:18 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacles 1, 2, 3, and 4. It appears there's a clear path above all obstacles. 

Let's try routing the path from the breakpoint (9.0, 18.53) as it sits above all obstacles. This point should allow a straight shot to the goal. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```

    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 18.53),  # Route to the breakpoint above the obstacles

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

[08/23/2024 01:14:02 PM] The current path goes directly through obstacles 2, 3, and 4. The longest valid subpath ends at the breakpoint (9.0, 1.25). To proceed, the path needs to navigate around these obstacles to reach the goal set.

One approach is to move vertically upwards from the breakpoint (9.0, 1.25) until clear of obstacles 2 and 4. We can then move rightwards, going around the top of obstacle 3, and finally downwards to the goal.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      // Start point
    (9.0, 1.25),     // Breakpoint
    (9.0, 16.0),     // Move upwards to clear obstacles 2 and 4
    (16.0, 16.0),    // Move rightwards, staying clear of obstacle 3 
    (19.0, 19.0)     // Move downwards to reach the goal

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

			Obstacle 1: [[0.3, 19.0], [4.0, 15.3], [14.3, 11.2], [12.9, 13.3]]

[08/23/2024 01:14:10 PM] The current path fails because it tries to pass between obstacles 1 and 2, which is too narrow. Instead, the path needs to go around obstacle 1, which requires passing to the right of obstacle 2 as well.

The path can use the breakpoints in set 1 to navigate around the obstacles. The path can first proceed to the breakpoint at (9.0, 10.22). Then, it can move horizontally to the right, avoiding obstacle 3. Finally, it can head towards the goal set.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 1.25),  # Pass through the first breakpoint
    (9.0, 10.22), # Pass through the second breakpoint

[08/23/2024 01:14:14 PM] The chosen first breakpoint leads into a dead end, so let's try the third breakpoint in set 1: (9.0, 18.53). From this point, we can move directly to the goal set without intersecting any obstacles.

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 18.53), 
    (19.0, 19.0)
