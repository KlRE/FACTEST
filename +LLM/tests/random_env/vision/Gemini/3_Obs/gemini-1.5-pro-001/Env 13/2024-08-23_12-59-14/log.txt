# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.6, 8.3], [3.7, 5.9], [7.8, 14.1], [3.6, 10.3]]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

[08/23/2024 01:00:00 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to go around obstacle 2. Since the path already goes through a valid breakpoint, we only need to add waypoints to circumvent the obstacle.

1. **Identify the issue:** The segment between (9.0, 15.52) and (11.0, 19.5) intersects obstacle 2.

2. **Find a way around:** We can guide the path around the left side of obstacle 2. 

3. **Add waypoints:** 
    *  Add a waypoint at (9.0, 19.5) to navigate around the top-left corner of obstacle 2.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [(1.0, 1.0), (1.0, 15.0), (9.0, 15.52), (9.0, 19.5), (11.0, 19.5), (19.0, 19.0)]

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data

[08/23/2024 01:00:15 PM] The current path collides with obstacle 3 because it attempts to move directly downwards after passing through the breakpoint. To circumvent this, the path needs to navigate around the right side of obstacle 3 before proceeding to the goal. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),        # Start within the start set
    (1.0, 15.0),       # Move upwards 
    (9.0, 15.52),      # Pass through the breakpoint 
    (13.0, 15.52),     # Move right, staying above obstacle 3 
    (17.0, 18.5),      # Move towards the goal, passing below obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)       # End within the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Staying Above Obstacle 3:** Instead of immediately moving down from the breakpoint, the path now moves right to (13.0, 15.52), staying above obstacle 3.

2. **Navigating to the Goal:** From (13.0, 15.52), the path moves diagonally downwards to (17.0, 18.5), passing below obstacle 2. This ensures a collision-free path to the goal.

3. **Final Approach:** Finally, the path takes a short step to (19.0, 19.0), comfortably within the goal set.
