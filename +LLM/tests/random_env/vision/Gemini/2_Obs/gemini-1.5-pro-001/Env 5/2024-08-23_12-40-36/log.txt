# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]

[08/23/2024 12:41:00 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid Obstacle 2. There's enough space between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2 to navigate through. We can achieve this by routing the path above Obstacle 2. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 7.15),  # Pass through the breakpoint 
    (12.0, 8.0),  # Continue moving towards the goal, staying below Obstacle 2
    (16.0, 16.0), # Move upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Reach the goal within the goal set
]
```

This path first utilizes the existing valid segment and then introduces a new waypoint to navigate around Obstacle 2. It ensures a safe distance from all obstacles while passing through the required breakpoint.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[0.1, 16.4], [9.5, 16.3], [9.5, 17.7], [9.3, 19.9]]
			Obstacle 2: [[11.3, 16.4], [11.0, 12.7], [18.4, 12.3], [19.8, 14.1]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 7.15), (9.0, 20.89)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 7.15), (12.0, 8.0), (16.0, 16.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 3 between points (12.0, 8.0) and (16.0, 16.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 2: [[11.3, 16.4], [11.0, 12.7], [18.4, 12.3], [19.8, 14.1]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 7.15), (12.0, 8.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

[08/23/2024 12:41:08 PM] The provided path collides with Obstacle 2 as it tries to move from the breakpoint in set 1 directly towards the goal. The path needs to navigate around the obstacle while ensuring it does not create a new collision.

One approach is to route the path above Obstacle 2:

1. **Continue from the last valid point:** (12.0, 8.0)
2. **Move above Obstacle 2:** (12.0, 17.0) This point is above the highest point of Obstacle 2.
3. **Proceed towards the goal:** (16.0, 17.0) This maintains a safe distance from Obstacle 2.
4. **Reach the goal set:** (19.0, 19.0)

Therefore, the adjusted path is:
```
new_path = [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 7.15), (12.0, 8.0), (12.0, 17.0), (16.0, 17.0), (19.0, 19.0)]
