# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[19.8, 12.4], [15.7, 13.5], [18.3, 1.8], [19.1, 4.8]]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.

		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data

[08/23/2024 12:46:14 PM] The second segment of the provided path crosses obstacle 2. To circumvent this, we can route the path around the left side of obstacle 2.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start in the start set
    (9.0, 6.11), # Pass through the breakpoint
    (9.0, 8.0),  # Move upwards, staying clear of obstacle 2
    (4.0, 8.0), # Move leftwards, clear of obstacle 2
    (4.0, 15.0),  # Move upwards, maintaining clearance
    (19.0, 15.0), # Move rightwards towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Arrive at the goal set
]
```

This path avoids obstacle 2 by first moving upwards and then navigating around its left side. It ensures a safe distance from the obstacle while passing through the required breakpoint and reaching the goal.

[08/23/2024 12:46:25 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 2. Since the current path goes south of the obstacle, we will explore options in that direction.

1. **Valid Subpath:** The longest valid subpath from the start is [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 6.11), (9.0, 8.0), (4.0, 8.0), (4.0, 15.0)].  We can continue from here.

2. **Going Around Obstacle 2:** Instead of moving horizontally at y=15.0, we can go around the bottom of Obstacle 2. 

3. **New Waypoints:**  Let's add waypoints to navigate around the obstacle:

    * From (4.0, 15.0) move to (4.0, 9.0) to go below Obstacle 2.
    * From (4.0, 9.0) move to  (17.0, 9.0) to clear the obstacle horizontally.
    * From (17.0, 9.0) move to (17.0, 19.0) to align with the goal set.
    * Finally, move to (19.0, 19.0) within the goal set.
