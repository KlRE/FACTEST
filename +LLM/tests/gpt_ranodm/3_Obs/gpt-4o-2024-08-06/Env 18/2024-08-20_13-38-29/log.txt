# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[17.8, 19.0], [15.7, 17.9], [17.5, 15.7], [18.1, 16.4]]
			Obstacle 2: [[19.3, 6.1], [17.4, 11.1], [17.5, 7.2], [19.2, 5.4]]
			Obstacle 3: [[18.1, 16.2], [7.6, 18.4], [8.3, 16.1], [8.9, 15.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 6.5), (9.0, 20.05)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
new_path = [
    [0.5, 0.5], # start in the start set
    [0.0, 5.25], # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    [3.75, 5.25], # move rightwards to reach the gap
    [4.5, 4.5] # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/20/2024 01:38:36 PM] Based on the provided data, we'll define a path that starts within the start position quadrilateral, avoids all defined obstacles, passes through a set of the given breakpoints, and ends within the goal position quadrilateral.

### Planned Path

Let's choose a strategic path to meet the task requirements: 

1. **Start Point**: Begin at a strategic point within the start quadrilateral, say (1.0, 1.0).
2. **Navigate Towards First Breakpoint**: We'll choose the breakpoint (9.0, 6.5) from Breakpoint Set 1.
3. **Navigate Around Obstacles**: Carefully plot waypoints to avoid touching or crossing any obstacles:
   - Navigate towards the second quadrant while skirting around the obstacles.
4. **Final Waypoint**: Move towards an endpoint within the goal quadrilateral, say (19.0, 19.0).

### Path Array

This series of waypoints will define a viable path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start quadrilateral
    (5.0, 3.0),   # Move diagonally, clear of any obstacles
    (8.0, 6.0),   # Orient towards a clear zone near the breakpoint
    (9.0, 6.5),   # Pass through the first chosen breakpoint
    (14.0, 8.0),  # Navigate through a clear zone avoiding Object 2
    (18.5, 16.0), # Move to a position aligning with the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End within the goal quadrilateral
]
```

### Explanation

- **Waypoints**: Each waypoint is chosen to ensure smooth and linear transitions that avoid obstacles.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: The path carefully skirts around all defined obstacles, maintaining a safe distance.
- **Breakpoint Inclusion**: Includes at least one point from the given breakpoint set, satisfying the breakpoint requirement.
- **Start and End Positions**: The path begins and ends within the respective start and goal quadrilaterals.
