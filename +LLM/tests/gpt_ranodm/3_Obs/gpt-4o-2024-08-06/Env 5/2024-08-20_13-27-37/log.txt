# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[2.5, 12.5], [12.6, 13.6], [12.4, 17.1], [2.7, 15.1]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.6, 16.2], [5.3, 11.9], [13.6, 7.0], [8.9, 14.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[16.0, 18.8], [8.8, 15.2], [18.9, 15.2], [19.6, 16.1]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 3.86), (9.0, 19.2)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
new_path = [
    [0.5, 0.5], # start in the start set
    [0.0, 5.25], # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    [3.75, 5.25], # move rightwards to reach the gap
    [4.5, 4.5] # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/20/2024 01:27:43 PM] To construct a path from the start quadrilateral to the goal quadrilateral while avoiding the obstacles and ensuring the path passes through a breakpoint, we can consider the following path:

### Path Plan
- Start at a point inside the start quadrilateral, for example at (1.0, 1.0).
- Avoiding obstacles and passing through breakpoints, choose a clear path.
- Since we must pass through at least one breakpoint from the provided set, we can use the point (9.0, 3.86) from Breakpoint Set 1. 
- End at a point inside the goal quadrilateral, for example at (19.0, 19.0).

### Proposed Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),       # Start in the start set
    (5.0, 3.0),       # Move towards a safe waypoint avoiding obstacles
    (8.0, 3.5),       # Another safe waypoint avoiding obstacles
    (9.0, 3.86),      # Pass through breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1
    (12.0, 5.0),      # Move upwards avoiding obstacles 1 and 2
    (16.0, 10.0),     # Navigate around obstacles to right
    (18.0, 17.0),     # Move closer to the goal set, avoiding obstacle 3
    (19.0, 19.0)      # End in the goal set
]
```

### Considerations
- We start within the defined start set and end inside the goal set.
- The waypoint (9.0, 3.86) ensures we pass through Breakpoint Set 1.
- The choice of each waypoint is made keeping in mind the need to maintain a buffer zone around the obstacles and avoid intersecting them.

[08/20/2024 01:28:03 PM] To correct the path and avoid intersections with obstacles, we need to strategically adjust our waypoints. The original path attempted an approach through Segment 5 from (12.0, 5.0) to (12.0, 11.0), which intersects with Obstacle 2. Here's how we can amend the path:

### Current Analysis
1. **Start and Progress**: The path starts correctly and progresses without issue until segment 5.
2. **Obstacle Intersection**: Segment 5 intersects with Obstacle 2. This obstacle spans quite a significant area, so a careful rerouting is needed.
3. **Breakpoint**: It correctly passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 3.86) from Breakpoint Set 1.

### Strategy for Correction
1. **Avoidance of Obstacle 2**: Since moving directly upwards from (12.0, 5.0) to (12.0, 11.0) hits Obstacle 2, we should plan to move around it.
2. **Horizontal or Diagonal Approach**: Consider rerouting horizontally or diagonally to skirt around Obstacle 2 and then readjust to head towards the goal.
3. **Continue from Valid Subpath**: Begin adjustment from the last valid waypoint (12.0, 5.0).

### New Path
- Start at the initial point in the start set.
- Maintain the valid initial path through to (12.0, 5.0).
- From (12.0, 5.0), move horizontally to the right to avoid Obstacle 2.
- Navigate upwards once clear of Obstacle 2, and proceed towards the goal.

### Proposed New Path
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start in the start set
    (5.0, 3.0),      # First waypoint
    (8.0, 3.5),      # Next move towards the breakpoint
    (9.0, 3.86),     # Pass through the required breakpoint
    (12.0, 5.0),     # Continue until the valid waypoint before encounter with obstacle
    (14.0, 5.0),     # Move right to avoid the obstacle
    (14.0, 12.0),    # Move upwards once clear above Obstacle 2
    (15.0, 15.0),    # Continue upwards towards the final goal by weaving through remaining spaced obstacles
    (18.0, 17.0),    # Closer to the final goal
    (19.0, 19.0)     # End at a point in the goal set
]
```

### Calculations & Consideration
- **Safety Margins**: Ensure that the chosen waypoint of (14.0, 5.0) clears the right edge of Obstacle 2 based on its vertices, allowing for safe passage.
- **Spatial Awareness**: Consider the vertex coordinates of Obstacles and Goal set to ensure the direction is correct, and adjustments avoid any further interaction.
- **Verification**: Confirm that the proposed waypoint transitions do not cross or touch any other obstacles throughout their segments, utilizing visualization or additional checks.

[08/20/2024 01:28:13 PM] To adjust the path to avoid intersecting the obstacles, let's evaluate the problematic segment and make the necessary adjustments while ensuring that the path meets all requirements, such as starting and ending inside the start and goal sets, and passing through a breakpoint.

### Current Path Evaluation
1. **Valid Segments:**
   - Segments from (1.0, 1.0) to (15.0, 15.0) are valid as per the feedback since they do not intersect with any obstacles.
   
2. **Problematic Segment:**
   - The segment between points (15.0, 15.0) and (18.0, 17.0) intersects with Obstacle 3. We need to re-route this segment to avoid the obstacle.

### Plan for Adjustment
1. **Avoiding Obstacle 3:**
   - Since both points (15.0, 15.0) and (18.0, 17.0) are near the obstacle, we will slightly alter the path after (15.0, 15.0) to bypass Obstacle 3.
   - I'll add a waypoint that diverts the path upwards and to the right to clear the obstacle.

2. **Ensuring Path Completeness:**
   - Add an extra waypoint if necessary to smoothly enter the goal set after bypassing Obstacle 3.

3. **Maintain Breakpoint Validity:**
   - Ensure that the path still passes through an existing breakpoint on its way from start to goal.

### New Path Proposal
```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),       # Start in the start set
    (5.0, 3.0),       #
    (8.0, 3.5),       #
    (9.0, 3.86),      # Pass through the first breakpoint
    (12.0, 5.0),      #
    (14.0, 5.0),      #
    (14.0, 12.0),     #
    (15.0, 15.0),     #
    (15.5, 17.0),     # New waypoint to avoid Obstacle 3 by moving up and slightly right
    (18.0, 17.5),     # Another waypoint to ensure we move around the top side of Obstacle 3
    (19.0, 19.0)      # Final point inside the goal set
]
```

### Explanation
- Start at (1.0, 1.0), which lies within the defined start set.
- Proceed through the defined waypoints up to (15.0, 15.0), where the problematic segment begins.
- Instead of moving directly to (18.0, 17.0), add a waypoint at (15.5, 17.0) to move upwards and avoid the obstacle.
- Include another waypoint at (18.0, 17.5) to ensure that the path clears the top of the obstacle.
- Finally, enter the goal set at (19.0, 19.0).

This path maintains a safe distance from obstacles while reaching the goal effectively and passing through the required breakpoint.

[08/20/2024 01:28:24 PM] To adjust the path and ensure it doesn't intersect with any obstacles, let's take a step-by-step approach based on the feedback and provided data:

### Analysis

1. **Start Point**:
   - The path starts correctly within the start set at (1.0, 1.0).

2. **End Point**:
   - The path ends correctly within the goal set at (19.0, 19.0).

3. **Intersecting Segment**:
   - The feedback indicates that segment 8 (between points (15.0, 15.0) and (15.5, 17.0)) intersects with Obstacle 3. We need to modify the path to avoid this collision.

4. **Breakpoints**:
   - The path correctly passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 3.86).

5. **Obstacle Avoidance**:
   - We must navigate between the obstacles while keeping a safe distance. Adding waypoints can help reroute around obstacles.

### Path Adjustment Strategy

- Since the segment 8 causes the intersection, we'll modify this segment to detour around Obstacle 3.

- Let's review the position and shape of the obstacles to decide on a path that avoids them effectively.

- Adjust segment 8 to circumvent Obstacle 3 while considering the coordinates of all obstacles, particularly those of Obstacle 3. 

- We'll maintain proximity to the previously defined breakpoints and valid path up to (15.0, 15.0) and strategize a path forward from there.

### Proposed Path Adjustments

Here’s how we can adjust the path to resolve the intersection issue:

1. **Up to Segment 7**:
   - Retain the previous valid subpath from start to (15.0, 15.0).

2. **Modify Segment 8 and Forward**:

   - Instead of moving to (15.5, 17.0), adjust the path to create a safe distance from Obstacle 3:
     - A suggestion would be to navigate westwards slightly for greater distance from the obstacle and then proceed northwards, avoiding the conflict zone.
     - New Path Points: Let's create a divert from (15.0, 15.0) slightly westward, then north, then back onto a safer path towards the goal set.

### New Path

Based on my proposed strategy, here's the refined path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),       # start in the start set
    (5.0, 3.0),
    (8.0, 3.5),
    (9.0, 3.86),      # through the breakpoint
    (12.0, 5.0),
    (14.0, 5.0),
    (14.0, 12.0),
    (15.0, 15.0),     # before diverging to avoid Obstacle 3
    (14.0, 16.0),     # move slightly left or safest positive x 
    (14.5, 18.0),     # move upwards to maintain distance
    (18.0, 17.5),     # aligning back towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)      # end in the goal set
]
```

### Explanation

- **New Segment (15.0, 15.0) to (14.0, 16.0)**:
  - Detours left (west) to circumnavigate Obstacle 3.

- **New Segment (14.0, 16.0) to (14.5, 18.0)**:
  - Moves upwards safely avoiding intrusion into the conflict zone of obstacle 3.

- **Ending**:
  - Redirects slightly towards the goal while aligning the path to remain clear of all obstacles, catering to previous segments' path.

This approach ensures the path meets all constraints while moving smoothly from start to goal without collision.

3. **Avoiding Obstacle 3**: The initial segment between (15.0, 15.0) and (14.0, 16.0) intersects with Obstacle 3. Instead, I will adjust the path to bypass the obstacle without crossing it.

   - **New Waypoint**: After reaching (15.0, 15.0), proceed vertically upward to a new point (15.0, 17.2), just above Obstacle 3.
   - **Align with Goal Set**: Move towards the right to (18.0, 18.0), ensuring this path segment does not intersect any obstacles.
   - **Final Point**: Connect to the final goal set by moving to (19.0, 19.0).

The revised path maintains a course through valid checkpoints and ensures obstacle avoidance, ending in the goal set.

### New Path:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start Point
    (5.0, 3.0),
    (8.0, 3.5),
    (9.0, 3.86),  # Breakpoint
    (12.0, 5.0),
    (14.0, 5.0),
    (14.0, 12.0),
    (15.0, 15.0), # End of valid subpath
    (15.0, 17.2), # New Waypoint to bypass obstacle
    (18.0, 18.0), # Adjusted path toward goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Goal Point
]
```

In this adjustment, we've maintained a safe distance from Obstacle 3 by adding a waypoint at (15.0, 17.2), circumventing its boundary before aligning with the goal set. This path also adheres to all requirements by passing through a designated breakpoint, starting in the start set, and concluding in the goal set without crossing any obstacles.
