# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

[08/20/2024 01:52:17 PM] To design a path that adheres to the given constraints, we'll need to carefully choose waypoints that start within the defined start position, pass through a breakpoint, avoid intersecting obstacles, and finally end within the goal position. Here's a suggested path:

### Proposed Path

- **Starting Point:** Choose a point within the start quadrilateral. For simplicity, select (1.0, 1.0).
- **Break through the first breakpoint set:** Choose the point (9.0, 7.6) as it is accessibly direct and seems less obstructive.
- **Goal Area:** Approach the goal quadrilateral aiming for a safe coordinate inside this zone while respecting the obstacles around.

### Waypoints:

- **Start Point:** (1.0, 1.0) - Begin within the start set.
- **Move to Breakpoint:** (9.0, 7.6) - Ensure passing through the first breakpoint.
- **Approach Goal Area:** Past obstacle navigation is crucial here. Select a path avoiding obstacle boundaries by going around or avoiding close proximity:
  - Bypass to (10.5, 10.0) - Skirt around potential obstacles ensuring clearance.
  - Advance toward (14.0, 14.0) - Continue maintaining a valid distance from recognized obstacles.
  - Approach (17.0, 16.0) - Carefully glide beside avoiding direct contact with obstacles.
- **End Point:** (19.0, 19.0) - Finish inside the goal set whilst maintaining a safe distance from obstacles.

### Final Path Array:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),        # Start within the start quadrilateral
    (9.0, 7.6),        # Pass through the chosen breakpoint
    (10.5, 10.0),      # Navigate around obstacles
    (14.0, 14.0),      # Continue navigating around obstacles
    (17.0, 16.0),      # Skirt next to other obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)       # End within the goal quadrilateral
]
```

This path avoids crossing the obstacles by planning waypoints around them, ensuring the trajectory does not intersect any obstacle. It also passes through one of the given breakpoints and starts and ends within the specified areas.

[08/20/2024 01:52:24 PM] To address the issue with the existing path that intersects with obstacles, especially between the waypoints (14.0, 14.0) and (17.0, 16.0), we need to make some adjustments. Let's analyze the path and obstacles to fix this.

### Analysis and Adjustments:

1. **Maintaining Valid Waypoints:** 
   - Start with the valid subpath up to (14.0, 14.0). These points do not intersect any obstacles, so we can retain this segment.

2. **Obstacle Examination:**
   - **Obstacle 2 and 3 Intersection:** The segment between (14.0, 14.0) and (17.0, 16.0) intersects with two obstacles:
     - Obstacle 2: Defined by vertices like [19.8, 15.9], [14.5, 17.4].
     - Obstacle 3: Defined by vertices like [15.1, 17.5].
   - **Obstacle Shape Consideration:** Notice how both obstacles cluster around the region between x-values 14 to 18, and y-values between 15 and 18.

3. **Finding a Detour:**
   - **Elevation Avoidance:** Elevate slightly by choosing a waypoint that goes around the northern side of the cluster of obstacles.
   - **Waypoint Addition:** Add a breakpoint at (15.0, 18.5) to safely navigate above the problem area.
   - **Goal Completion:** Finally, connect the waypoint to (19.0, 19.0) which is within the goal zone.

4. **Ensure Breakpoint Inclusion:** The path currently passes through the required breakpoint (9.0, 7.6).

### Proposed New Path:

After the analysis and strategizing, the new path to avoid intersecting with any obstacles is:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),       # Start Point
    (9.0, 7.6),       # Required Breakpoint
    (10.5, 10.0),     # Valid point not intersecting any obstacles
    (14.0, 14.0),     # Last valid waypoint before intersection
    (15.0, 18.5),     # New waypoint to bypass the cluster from above
    (19.0, 19.0)      # End Point within the goal set
]
```

### Conclusion:
The adjusted path is designed to avoid the identified intersection with obstacles by elevating the route slightly above the problematic area while maintaining compliance with other requirements such as including at least one breakpoint. The new path should successfully navigate the given environment from the start to the goal without intersecting the obstacles.

[08/20/2024 01:52:36 PM] ### Chain of Thought

Given the current path [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 7.6), (10.5, 10.0), (14.0, 14.0), (15.0, 18.5), (19.0, 19.0)], we have identified that the path segment between (14.0, 14.0) and (15.0, 18.5) intersects with both obstacles 2 and 3. The goal is to adjust this portion of the path to avoid intersecting these obstacles while fulfilling the requirement to pass through a breakpoint and reach the goal set.

1. **Validation of Current Valid Subpath**: 
   - The subpath [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 7.6), (10.5, 10.0), (14.0, 14.0)] is already validated against the obstacle configurations, so we retain this section.

2. **Analyzing Problematic Segment**:
   - The segment between (14.0, 14.0) and (15.0, 18.5) intersects with obstacles 2 and 3, as this segment moves diagonally upwards, it likely tries to traverse through a dense region of obstacles.

3. **Obstacle Spatial Analysis**:
   - **Obstacle 2**: Primary concern due to its proximity to the start of the problematic segment with vertices [[19.8, 15.9], [14.5, 17.4], [16.2, 15.6], [18.1, 15.5]]. The critical section extends horizontally from (14.5, ~15.5) to (18.1, ~15.5).
   - **Obstacle 3**: Close proximity with varied heights with vertices [[11.3, 18.0], [13.1, 15.1], [18.6, 14.7], [15.1, 17.5]]. Contains potential bottleneck zones in the y-range.
   
4. **Path Adjustments**:
   - **Detour Around Obstacles 2 and 3**: 
     - It is crucial to maneuver the path between or around these obstacles to reach the goal.
     - Moving slightly north before re-aligning east to avoid obstacle 2's proximity, while avoiding the merge zone.
     - Realign to move a smoother path towards the goal set.

5. **New Waypoints**:
   - Introduce a slight northern path adjustment after (14.0, 14.0) and then direct eastward movement:
     - Added waypoint slightly north/east to bypass the vertical space between obstacles: Potential waypoint (14.5, 14.5)
     - Move further toward the goal set while maintaining clearance: New waypoint (16.0, 16.5)
     - Approach the goal set more head-on, aiming at a clearance path just alongside obstacle 4’s northern boundary: Final waypoint (18.5, 18.5)
     
6. **Ensure Passing through Breakpoint**: 
   - The path going through (9.0, 7.6) already satisfies the breakpoint requirement with no need of further adjustment along the start.

[08/20/2024 01:52:44 PM] To address the feedback provided, we need to adjust the path segment from (14.5, 14.5) to (16.0, 16.5) that intersects with Obstacles 2 and 3. The intersection happens because the path segment is crossing the area where these obstacles overlap.

### Analysis and Adjustments:

1. **Identify Problem Segment**: The problematic segment is between (14.5, 14.5) and (16.0, 16.5), as this line enters the overlapping area of obstacles.

2. **Obstacle Layout Consideration**: 
   - **Obstacle 2**: The obstacle spanned roughly horizontally and partially upward. This indicates an area that needs careful navigation to avoid the middle of the obstacle.
   - **Obstacle 3**: It is positioned more vertically with significant horizontal width, suggesting we maneuver by considering the minimal width between these obstacles.

3. **Routing Strategy**: 
   - Avoid going into the overlapping middle of Obstacle 2 and 3. We can maneuver upwards after reaching valid subpoints.
   - Make use of open spaces or the edges of the obstacle's perimeter to create a safe passage while taking breakpoints into account.

4. **Pathway Design**:
   - After reaching the valid subpath at (14.5, 14.5), adjust upwards while skimming the edge of the obstacle arrangement.
   - Introduce a new waypoint to avoid the middle section of the obstacles and iterate cautiously to the goal set.

### Revised Path Suggestion:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),         # Start point
    (9.0, 7.6),         # Valid breakout point through set 1
    (10.5, 10.0),       # Valid intermediate point
    (14.0, 14.0),       # Avoiding direct intersection
    (14.5, 14.5),       # Last good point before problematic section
    (13.5, 16.0),       # Added a waypoint upwards/left to avoid middle of overlap 
    (16.0, 19.0),       # Ascend above obstacles, staying clear
    (18.5, 18.5),       # Near the goal zone, ensures safe clearance
    (19.0, 19.0)        # End point within the goal set
]
```

### Explanation:
- By skirting around the obstacle starting perimeter upwards and slightly left, then moving above to ensure we're clear, the path avoids problematic spots that are dense with obstacle intersections.
- This path introduces a new temporary waypoint (13.5, 16.0) which bypasses the problematic area directly upwards, utilizing the notion of skew and offset to pass above potential risk, offering clear spatial distance from outlined quadrilateral obstacles.

This adjustment provides a more seamless navigation through the labyrinth of obstacles, while clearly defining non-crossing segments according to provided requirements.

[08/20/2024 01:52:57 PM] To adjust the path to ensure it does not intersect with any obstacles, let's analyze the spatial relationship between the proposed path segments and the identified obstacles:

1. **Review of the Path and Problematic Segment**: The original path was as follows:
   - Path: [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 7.6), (10.5, 10.0), (14.0, 14.0), (14.5, 14.5), (13.5, 16.0), (16.0, 19.0), (18.5, 18.5), (19.0, 19.0)]
   - The segment between (14.5, 14.5) and (13.5, 16.0) intersects with Obstacle 3: [[11.3, 18.0], [13.1, 15.1], [18.6, 14.7], [15.1, 17.5]]

2. **Analyzing Obstacle 3**: This obstacle is quite close to our path between the mentioned waypoints. We need to avoid intersecting it by altering our path. The obstacle's vertices outline a quadrilateral that spans approximately from (11.3, 18.0) to (15.1, 17.5). Therefore, a path leading through this general area from around (14.5, 14.5) to (13.5, 16.0) without careful adjustment is inevitably problematic.

3. **Adjusting the Path to Circumnavigate the Obstacle**:
   - From the last valid point (14.5, 14.5), we shall avoid descending too low into the region spanned by Obstacle 3. Instead, we can aim to adjust the trajectory upwards and slightly eastwards initially before curving towards the goal.

4. **Proposing a New Path**:
   - **Starting Point**: (1.0, 1.0) remains viable.
   - **Align with Breakpoint**: Maintain (9.0, 7.6) to align with one of the breakpoints.
   - **Navigating Towards Goal**:
     - Move to (10.5, 10.0) for progression towards the goal area without hitting any obstacles.
     - Move to (14.0, 14.0) to further navigate across open space.
     - Instead of moving towards (14.5, 14.5), angle slightly more upwards.
     - **New Waypoints**: After (14.0, 14.0), insert a precautionary waypoint:
       - Move to (15.0, 15.0) to provide clearance above the obstacle.
       - Include (17.0, 17.5) to ensure we remain clear before moving towards the goal.

5. **Finalize to Goal**: Now we can proceed towards the goal area:
   - Move directly to (18.5, 18.5)
   - Finish at the goal within (19.0, 19.0)

These adjustments ensure no segment crosses the obstacle while maintaining passage through the required breakpoint. Thus, the new proposed path would be:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 7.6),
    (10.5, 10.0),
    (14.0, 14.0),
    (15.0, 15.0),
    (17.0, 17.5),
    (18.5, 18.5),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This path preserves as much of the original path as possible while steering clear of intersections with Obstacle 3.

		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
new_path = [
    [0.5, 0.5], # start in the start set
    [0.0, 5.25], # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    [3.75, 5.25], # move rightwards to reach the gap
    [4.5, 4.5] # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/20/2024 01:53:08 PM] To address the issues with your current path and the provided feedback, we need to carefully navigate around Obstacle 3, whose vertices form a quadrilateral with coordinates [[11.3, 18.0], [13.1, 15.1], [18.6, 14.7], [15.1, 17.5]]. The crucial point where your path intersects the obstacle is between (14.0, 14.0) and (15.0, 15.0). We will now work through creating a valid path, avoiding this obstacle while maintaining the requirement to pass through a breakpoint.

## Analysis and Path Adjustment

1. **Start and Initial Segments:**
   - The path appropriately begins at (1.0, 1.0) within the start quadrilateral. 
   - It then progresses to the first breakpoint (9.0, 7.6) in Breakpoint Set 1, which is valid and should remain as part of the path.
  
2. **Obstacle Identification and Avoidance:**
   - After reaching (9.0, 7.6), the path continues to (10.5, 10.0) and (14.0, 14.0) without intersecting any obstacles. The challenge begins from this point as the next segment (14.0, 14.0) to (15.0, 15.0) crosses Obstacle 3.

3. **Re-routing to Avoid Obstacle 3:**
   - From (14.0, 14.0), we need to redirect the path to avoid intersecting Obstacle 3. One potential adjustment is rerouting towards the bottom-right region of Obstacle 3.
   - Move from (14.0, 14.0) to a point further away from the obstacle, e.g., (14.0, 13.0), ensuring we divert below the obstacle and steer clear from its vertices.
   - Additionally, navigating to (17.0, 14.0) can help to safely pass the obstacle from the lower side while heading towards the goal.

4. **Continuation to Goal:**
   - Once clear of Obstacle 3, the final approach to the goal can resume with a path such as:
     - From (17.0, 14.0) move to (18.0, 15.0) which is clear of previous noted obstacles.
     - Continue to (18.5, 18.5) and finally to (19.0, 19.0) as earlier noted, finishing within the goal set.

By modifying these segments, we ensure compliance with the path-planning requirements without intersecting with any obstacles.

## New Path Proposal

Here's the adjusted path, ensuring it begins in the start set, avoids the obstacles, utilizes a breakpoint, and ends in the goal set:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),         # Start position within the start quadrilateral
    (9.0, 7.6),         # Passing through a breakpoint
    (10.5, 10.0),       # Continue valid section
    (14.0, 14.0),       # Before encountering Obstacle 3
    (14.0, 13.0),       # Re-routing lower to avoid Obstacle 3
    (17.0, 14.0),       # Safely passing below the obstacle
    (18.0, 15.0),       # Transition closer to the goal
    (18.5, 18.5),       # Near the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)        # End position within the goal quadrilateral
]
```

This path circumvents the obstacle issue while fulfilling the planning criteria effectively.
