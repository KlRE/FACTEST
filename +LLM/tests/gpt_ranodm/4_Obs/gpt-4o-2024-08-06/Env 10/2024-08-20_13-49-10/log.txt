# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.9, 14.3], [15.6, 6.0], [16.0, 3.9], [19.0, 3.3]]
			Obstacle 2: [[14.7, 14.7], [17.1, 11.9], [19.3, 15.9], [15.3, 17.6]]
			Obstacle 3: [[13.6, 19.3], [6.3, 16.0], [13.2, 16.0], [15.9, 16.8]]
			Obstacle 4: [[17.9, 15.8], [15.0, 15.0], [15.3, 13.1], [19.5, 11.1]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 7.0), (9.0, 19.61)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
new_path = [
    [0.5, 0.5], # start in the start set
    [0.0, 5.25], # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    [3.75, 5.25], # move rightwards to reach the gap
    [4.5, 4.5] # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/20/2024 01:49:16 PM] To devise a path that meets the requirements outlined in the task, we'll construct a sequence of waypoints. The path should originate in the start position, pass through a breakpoint from each set, and terminate in the goal position, all while circumventing the obstacles. Here's a step-by-step plan, followed by the resulting path array:

### Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Start Point:**
   - Choose a point within the start quadrilateral. We can select (1.0, 1.0) as a safe starting point.

2. **Passing Through Breakpoint Set 1:**
   - From the start point (1.0, 1.0), move to a breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1. Let's choose the point (9.0, 7.0).

3. **Avoid Obstacles:**
   - To avoid the obstacles, navigate carefully. After reaching (9.0, 7.0), move towards the topmost region near the breakpoints to avoid most obstacles.
   - Head for a safe spot like (9.0, 19.0) to ensure clearance from the obstacles below.

4. **Pass Through Breakpoint Set 1 Again If Necessary:**
   - We can choose to move towards the upper region of the map to avoid the majority of the obstacles. This helps reduce complex navigation.

5. **To Goal Point:**
   - Finally, from (9.0, 19.0), move directly towards the goal quadrilateral. We can select (19.0, 19.0) as the endpoint within the goal area, making sure the straight-line path avoids the upper portions of the quadrilaterals forming obstacles.

### Path Array

Thus, the planned path is as follows:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),       # Start within the start quadrilateral
    (9.0, 7.0),       # Pass through Breakpoint Set 1
    (9.0, 19.0),      # Avoid obstacles by moving upwards 
    (19.0, 19.0)      # End within the goal quadrilateral
]
```

This path ensures avoidance of obstacles by strategically moving around or above them, while conforming to the requirement of passing through specified breakpoints.

[08/20/2024 01:49:25 PM] To address the feedback and create a new valid path, let's re-evaluate the provided path by considering the start, goal, and obstacle positions:

1. **Analysis of Obstacles and Original Path:**
   - **Obstacle 3** contradicts the segment from (9.0, 7.0) to (9.0, 19.0). The vertices of Obstacle 3 are [[13.6, 19.3], [6.3, 16.0], [13.2, 16.0], [15.9, 16.8]]. The line from (9.0, 7.0) to (9.0, 19.0) runs vertically along x=9.0. Since this line intersects with y=16.0, which is within Obstacle 3’s range, it's problematic.

2. **Adjustments and Path Redesign:**
   - We need to bypass Obstacle 3 while still reaching a breakpoint and moving towards the goal.
   - A possible adjustment is to move around the obstacle after reaching (9.0, 7.0), potentially moving horizontally or around the obstacle.

3. **Constructing a New Path:**
   - Let's maintain the beginning of the path since (1.0, 1.0) to (9.0, 7.0) is valid.
   - After reaching (9.0, 7.0), make a detour to bypass Obstacle 3 by moving in x-direction first, avoiding troubling lines seen in the obstacle's vertices.

4. **Formulating the New Path:**
   - Start at (1.0, 1.0) within the start set.
   - Move to the validated waypoint (9.0, 7.0).
   - Navigate right to (10.0, 10.0) to avoid Obstacle 3 without intersecting it.
   - Proceed upwards to (10.0, 17.0), staying clear of Obstacle 3's range.
   - Then move towards the goal set at (19.0, 19.0).

By incorporating these steps, the new path respects the fundamental requirements, starts from the start set, avoids all obstacles due to carefully planned detours, and finishes inside the goal set after passing through the necessary breakpoints.

**New Path:**
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Starting point within the start set
    (9.0, 7.0),  # Initial validated waypoint
    (10.0, 10.0), # Adjusted waypoint to avoid Obstacle 3
    (10.0, 17.0), # Further adjusted waypoint ensuring clearance
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Ending point within the goal set
]

[08/20/2024 01:49:37 PM] To develop a new path that avoids crossing any obstacles, let's carefully analyze the problem with the previously identified issues and obstacles.

### Analysis of Current Path:
1. **Start Point**: The path correctly starts at a point `(1.0, 1.0)` within the start quadrilateral.
2. **Endpoint**: Ends correctly at `(19.0, 19.0)` in the goal quadrilateral.
3. **Breakpoints**: Passes through the important breakpoint `(9.0, 7.0)` from Breakpoint Set 1.
4. **Problematic Segment 3**: The segment from `(10.0, 10.0)` to `(10.0, 17.0)` intersects with Obstacle 3.

### Strategy for Correction:
- **Taking a Different Route**: The goal is to avoid the region where Segment 3 intersects with Obstacle 3. Instead of moving vertically from `(10.0, 10.0)`, consider moving diagonally or incorporating a detour.
- **Alternative Breakpoints**: Maintaining passage through one of the breakpoints is essential. `(9.0, 7.0)` is already used, and we should decide whether to keep using this or adjust the entire path.
- **Obstacle Clearance**: Ensure the path stays clear of other obstacles, especially near the edge of Zone 3.

### Revised Path Proposal:
1. **Start Point**: Begin at `(1.0, 1.0)`.
2. **First Segment**: Move to `(9.0, 7.0)` using the safe and previously validated path.
3. **New Detour from (9.0, 7.0)**: Instead of heading towards `(10.0, 10.0)`, take a safer and more diagonal path:
    - New waypoint `(12.0, 10.0)`, keeping well clear of the obstacle's lower left edge.
4. **Bypass Segment**: To avoid the overlap with Obstacle 3:
    - Move from `(12.0, 10.0)` to `(14.0, 14.0)`, effectively bypassing Obstacle 3, upwards and over.
5. **Approach Goal**: Go from `(14.0, 14.0)` diagonally to the endpoint `(19.0, 19.0)`, ensuring there's no proximity to other obstacles.

### New Path:
Given the adjustments needed to avoid obstacle intersections and maintain a valid path, here is a new proposed path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start inside the start set
    (9.0, 7.0),      # Pass through the breakpoint
    (12.0, 10.0),    # Diagonal towards a safer region
    (14.0, 14.0),    # Bypass more of the obstacles safely
    (19.0, 19.0)     # End inside the goal set
]
```

### Considerations:
- **Waypoint Spacing**: Adjust waypoint placement if there's still risk of touching or getting too close to obstacles.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.

[08/20/2024 01:49:47 PM] To correct the path and avoid intersection with obstacles while maintaining the requirements, we need to first analyze the existing path and its relation to the obstacles.

### Current Path and Issues:
1. **Current Path:** [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 7.0), (12.0, 10.0), (14.0, 14.0), (19.0, 19.0)]
2. **Valid Subpath:** From the feedback, the subpath [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 7.0), (12.0, 10.0), (14.0, 14.0)] is valid.
3. **Invalid Segment:** The segment from (14.0, 14.0) to (19.0, 19.0) intersects with Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 4.

### Strategy for Correction:
- Continue from the valid subpath.
- Identify alternate routes or waypoints to avoid the intersecting obstacles.
- Ensure that the path passes through a breakpoint and ends in the goal set.

### Avoiding Obstacles:
- **Obstacle 2:** (between (15.0, 17.6) and (19.3, 15.9)).
- **Obstacle 4:** (between (15.3, 13.1) and (19.5, 11.1)).

### Proposed Adjustments:
1. From (14.0, 14.0), avoid directly heading to (19.0, 19.0). Instead, choose a waypoint that takes the path around these obstacles.
2. Consider moving towards more north (y-axis) after (14.0, 14.0) to avoid crossing with obstacle parts.
3. Utilize the space near the boundary of the obstacles to navigate around them.

### New Path Proposal:
Given these considerations, a suitable path could be:

``` 
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),        # Start within Start Set
    (9.0, 7.0),        # Breakpoint in Set 1
    (12.0, 10.0),      # Continues along the valid path
    (14.0, 14.0),      # End of valid subpath
    (16.5, 17.0),      # New waypoint to skirt northeast around obstacles
    (18.5, 18.0),      # New waypoint to approach Goal Set without intersecting
    (19.0, 19.0)       # End within Goal Set
]
```
### Explanation:
- The path adds two new waypoints (16.5, 17.0) and (18.5, 18.0) to circumvent the areas occupied by Obstacle 2 and 4.
- These waypoints allow the path to curve around the obstacles, effectively avoiding intersections while guiding towards the Goal Set.
- The path remains continuous and linear between waypoints, maintaining simplicity and ensuring feasibility.

This corrected path maintains compliance with all given requirements while effectively resolving the intersection issues presented in the feedback.

[08/20/2024 01:49:59 PM] **Chain of Thought:**

To construct the corrected path, let's analyze the situation:

1. **Starting Point**: The path successfully starts at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start set.

2. **End Point**: The initial path ends at (19.0, 19.0), which is inside the goal set. Thus, the end point is valid.
   
3. **Breakpoints**: The original path correctly includes a breakpoint from set 1, which is (9.0, 7.0). No second set of breakpoints is required, but we must ensure we do pass through available breakpoints when necessary.

4. **Obstacle Analysis**:
    - **Segment 4** from (14.0, 14.0) to (16.5, 17.0) intersects with Obstacle 2. To mitigate this conflict, we should reroute the path such that it bypasses the affected area.
    - Observation of the obstacles reveals that the path gets crowded around the intersection of several obstacles, particularly between points (14.0, 14.0) and (16.5, 17.0).

5. **Path Adjustments**:
    - An effective modification involves deviating around the intersecting area to a region of open clearance.
    - We can move the path further away from the cluster of obstacles (14.7, 14.7), (17.1, 11.9), (19.3, 15.9), (15.3, 17.6) to ensure no intersection.

**New Path Strategy**:
   - Maintain a path where each segment progresses logically from the current valid subpath, carefully ensuring all obstacles are bypassed.

**Proposed New Path**:
```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Starting point
    (9.0, 7.0),  # Pass through breakpoint
    (12.0, 10.0),  # Stay clear of obstacles
    (14.0, 14.0),  # Last valid waypoint before
    (13.0, 18.0),  # Redirect the path up towards a clear area avoiding obstacle overlaps
    (16.0, 18.5),  # Continue diagonally to bypass the obstacle to the upper side
    (18.5, 18.0),  # Approach goal maintaining clearance
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Ending point in the goal set
]
```

**Description of the Path**:

- The path begins at (1.0, 1.0), moving smoothly to the breakpoint at (9.0, 7.0).
- From there, it continues to (12.0, 10.0) and (14.0, 14.0), where the valid sub-path ended previously.
- Adding a segment from (14.0, 14.0) going to (13.0, 18.0) raises above the problematic overlapping areas of the obstacles.
- It then moves up towards (16.0, 18.5), helping avoid any direct obstacle intersections before reaching the final approach.
- The path proceeds in a descending angle downwards to enter the endpoint at (19.0, 19.0) within the goal set.

Through this path adjustment, every segment now maintains clearance from all identified obstacles.

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
new_path = [
    [0.5, 0.5], # start in the start set
    [0.0, 5.25], # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    [3.75, 5.25], # move rightwards to reach the gap
    [4.5, 4.5] # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/20/2024 01:50:10 PM] To correct the provided path, we need to adjust the segment between waypoints (14.0, 14.0) and (13.0, 18.0) because it intersects with Obstacle 3. We'll maintain the valid subpath: [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 7.0), (12.0, 10.0), (14.0, 14.0)], and find a new sequence of waypoints to reach the goal while avoiding all obstacles.

### Analyzing the Situation:
1. **Obstacle 3 is in our way**: The problematic segment between (14.0, 14.0) and (13.0, 18.0) intersects the upper boundary of Obstacle 3. Therefore, the path should be adjusted to either go around Obstacle 3 to the left or right.

2. **Other Obstacles Considerations**: Additionally, Obstacle 3 is close to Obstacles 2 and 4, so we need to ensure that any adjustment avoids these as well.

### New Path Strategy:
- From (14.0, 14.0), instead of heading directly to (13.0, 18.0), we can move to a higher coordinate, skirting around Obstacle 3 towards its left or right while making sure not to touch Obstacle 4 either.

### New Waypoints:
Let's choose to go around the left of Obstacle 3:

1. **Current Valid Path**: [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 7.0), (12.0, 10.0), (14.0, 14.0)]

2. **Add New Waypoints**:
   - After (14.0, 14.0), move up slightly and to the left, carefully to avoid Obstacle 3, reaching (12.0, 17.0).
   - From (12.0, 17.0), head directly up towards (14.0, 19.0), staying clear of Obstacle 3.
   - Continue to the breakpoint near the goal, e.g., (18.5, 18.0).
   - Finally, end at a point within the Goal Position, like (19.0, 19.0). 

### Suggested New Path:
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the Start Position
    (9.0, 7.0),    # Pass through Breakpoint in Set 1
    (12.0, 10.0), 
    (14.0, 14.0), 
    (12.0, 17.0),  # Adjust around left of Obstacle 3
    (14.0, 19.0),  # Align vertically above Obstacle 3
    (18.5, 18.0),  # Near Breakpoint to finish in Goal Position
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Inside Goal Position
]

This new path maintains the constraints given, starts and ends in the correct sets, avoids intersecting with obstacles, and still passes through the required breakpoints.
