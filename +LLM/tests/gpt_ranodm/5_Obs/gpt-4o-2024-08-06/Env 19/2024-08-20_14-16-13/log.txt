# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.6, 15.9], [10.7, 16.1], [10.1, 18.5], [5.1, 17.7]]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.

    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
new_path = [
    [0.5, 0.5], # start in the start set
    [0.0, 5.25], # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    [3.75, 5.25], # move rightwards to reach the gap
    [4.5, 4.5] # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/20/2024 02:16:21 PM] To construct a valid path from the provided start set to the goal set while avoiding the obstacles, we will select an appropriate sequence of waypoints that respects all the constraints and requirements.

### Analysis:
1. **Start and End Points:**
   - Start Point: We can start from any point inside the start quadrilateral. Let's choose (1.0, 1.0) for simplicity.
   - Goal Point: The endpoint will be any point inside the goal quadrilateral. Let's choose (19.0, 19.0).

2. **Breakpoints:**
   - We need to incorporate one of the provided breakpoints into our path. This could be (9.0, 7.03) or (9.0, 20.16).

3. **Obstacle Avoidance:**
   - We need to ensure the path does not cross any obstacles. We will plan a path that deliberately steers clear of the quadrilaterals representing obstacles.

### Path Planning:
Keeping these in mind, let's outline the path:
- Start at an internal point in the start quadrilateral.
- Navigate through a selected breakpoint.
- Finally, arrive at an internal point in the goal quadrilateral without crossing obstacles.

Here is a carefully constructed path that satisfies all requirements:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start inside start quadrilateral
    (5.0, 1.0),   # Move right horizontally avoiding bottom edges of Obstacles 1 and 3
    (9.0, 7.03),  # Move diagonally up-right to pass through the first breakpoint
    (15.0, 12.0), # Ascend avoiding left edges of obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Finally move to the interior of the goal quadrilateral
]
```

### Explanation:
- **(1.0, 1.0) to (5.0, 1.0):** We start within the start area and move towards the right edge to avoid hitting the obstacle directly north.
- **(5.0, 1.0) to (9.0, 7.03):** We take a diagonal path upwards and right to reach our chosen breakpoint, avoiding the obstacles below and to the side.
- **(9.0, 7.03) to (15.0, 12.0):** We continue upward avoiding the cluster of obstacles in the center of our field.
- **(15.0, 12.0) to (19.0, 19.0):** Finally, we move up and right to reach the endpoint inside the goal area.

This path is intended to ensure that there is a reasonable berth around all obstacles per your requirement of non-crossing, and the path passes through each necessary area.

[08/20/2024 02:16:30 PM] To address the feedback and the corrections required for the provided path, let's analyze the spatial relationships and how the path intersects with obstacles.

### Analysis:
1. **Start and Goal Positions**: 
   - The path starts at (1.0, 1.0), which is inside the start quadrilateral.
   - The path ends at (19.0, 19.0), which is inside the goal quadrilateral.

2. **Obstacle Interaction**:
   - The path segment between (9.0, 7.03) and (15.0, 12.0) crosses obstacles 2 and 3.

3. **Waypoint Placement**:
   - The provided valid subpath *[(1.0, 1.0), (5.0, 1.0), (9.0, 7.03)]* avoids obstacles.

4. **Obstacle Locations**:
   - Obstacle 2 is positioned such that the path intersects when moving directly upwards and rightwards after (9.0, 7.03).
   - Obstacle 3 is placed diagonally, making linear progress towards the goal position intersecting with it.

### Changes and Thought Process:

1. **Adjust Path from Valid Subpath**:
   - From (9.0, 7.03), instead of taking a direct path towards (15.0, 12.0) which intersects with obstacles, add waypoints to navigate around them.

2. **Strategy for New Path**:
   - Move rightwards along x-axis after reaching (9.0, 7.03) to bypass the obstacle clusters.
   - Utilise the space between obstacles 2 and 3 without intersecting.
   - Finally, curve back towards the goal after passing the obstacles.

### New Path Plan:
- Start with the valid subpath and introduce new waypoints to avoid crossing into the obstacles.

**New Path:**
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),         # Starting point within the start set
    (5.0, 1.0),         # Move rightwards
    (9.0, 7.03),        # Pass through the valid breakpoint
    (10.5, 7.5),        # Skirt around obstacle 2, to the right
    (15.0, 10.0),       # Move upwards while avoiding the right side of obstacle 3
    (19.0, 19.0)        # Curve back into the internal area of the goal endpoint
]
```

### Conclusion:
This new path should navigate effectively between the obstacles by maintaining safe distances that prevent crossing into obstacle territories. By redirecting the path post the breakpoint, we ensure that the path accommodates obstacle placement effectively.

[08/20/2024 02:16:40 PM] To adjust the path and avoid intersecting with Obstacle 2, we should analyze the spatial layout more carefully and adjust some waypoints. Here’s a structured approach for solving the issue:

### Analyzing the Current Path

1. **Starting Point and Initial Path Segment:**
   - The path begins correctly from point \( (1.0, 1.0) \) and moves to \( (5.0, 1.0) \) without any obstacles in the way.

2. **Valid Subpath:**
   - The path segments from \( (1.0, 1.0) \) through \( (5.0, 1.0) \) to \( (9.0, 7.03) \) are valid.

3. **Intersection with Obstacle 2:**
   - Issue occurs between points \( (9.0, 7.03) \) and \( (10.5, 7.5) \) as it intersects with Obstacle 2. The path crosses through a point within the obstacle's bounds.

4. **Continuation Path:**
   - After crossing the obstacle, the path was intended to progress towards the goal through \( (19.0, 19.0) \), which is unnecessary to to change, but needs adjustment due to the invalid segment.

### Adjustments for Obstacle Avoidance

To construct a revised path, we should:

1. **Pass Through Start and Breakpoints Validly:**
   - Ensure to use a valid segment from the last valid waypoint \( (9.0, 7.03) \).

2. **Avoid Obstacle 2:**
   - From \( (9.0, 7.03) \), we circumvent Obstacle 2 by curving around it slightly to provide clearance.

3. **Rejoin Towards Goal:**
   - Connect safely to a higher point, heading towards the goal while avoiding intersecting other obstacles.

Here is a new possible path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # start in the start set
    (5.0, 1.0),     # valid early segment
    (9.0, 7.03),    # hit the breakpoint correctly
    (9.0, 12.0),    # move upwards to bypass Obstacle 2 vertically
    (11.0, 15.0),   # avoid Obstacle 2 and navigate upward, avoiding Obstacle 3
    (15.0, 17.0),   # move diagonally up-right, avoid other obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)    # enter goal set while avoiding obstacles and maintain clearance
]
```

### Key Considerations:

- **New Waypoints:** These allow the path to navigate safely around the obstacles and maintain minimal clearance.
- **Goal Set & Breakpoints:** The new path respects the requirements to pass through the specified breaker at \( (9.0, 7.03) \) and ends inside the goal set.
- **Obstacle Clearance:** The trajectory towards upper waypoints enables clearing from debris/barriers.

This revised route should ensure the path maintains a safe distance from the obstacles while fulfilling the original path requirements for valid start, goal, and breaker points.

[08/20/2024 02:16:52 PM] To construct a valid path for the given motion planning task, we need to ensure that the path meets all the specified requirements, mainly avoiding any intersections with the defined obstacles. Here is the step-by-step thought process to adjust the path based on the feedback provided:

### Feedback Recap
- The path successfully starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
- The original path crosses Obstacle 2 between the points (9.0, 12.0) and (11.0, 15.0).
- The longest valid subpath identified is as follows: [(1.0, 1.0), (5.0, 1.0), (9.0, 7.03), (9.0, 12.0)].

### Path Adjustment Strategy
1. **Examine the Valid Subpath**: The feedback indicates that the path until (9.0, 12.0) does not cross any obstacles. This segment will be retained as it satisfies all conditions up to that point.
   
2. **Identify the Crossing Segment**: The problematic segment between (9.0, 12.0) and (11.0, 15.0) intersects with Obstacle 2. This indicates the path needs adjustment post (9.0, 12.0).

3. **Detour Around Obstacle 2**: Since the segment intersects with Obstacle 2, we need to find a way around it. After reaching (9.0, 12.0), explore a route that steers clear of Obstacle 2. We can attempt to find a path above or below to bypass the obstacle.

4. **Use Breakpoints and Bypass**: We can consider extending the subpath using one of the breakpoints again or another nearby coordinate to circumvent the obstacle.
   
5. **Rejoin to Goal Region**: Once safely past the obstacles, direct the path towards an endpoint within the specified goal area.

### New Path Proposal
To avoid intersecting with Obstacle 2 after reaching (9.0, 12.0), the following adjustments can be made:

1. **Start from the Valid Subpath**: Use the identified valid segment [(1.0, 1.0), (5.0, 1.0), (9.0, 7.03), (9.0, 12.0)].

2. **Create Detour**: From (9.0, 12.0), move further upwards or to the sides slightly to avoid the obstacle's area:
   - Try bypassing above: (9.0, 14.0), which effectively means moving further north of the obstacle boundary.
   
3. **Reassess and Rejoin Path**: After circumventing the obstacle, find a smoother path to head towards the goal:
   - Head diagonally towards the goal by setting another waypoint like (12.0, 16.0), safely away from the obstacle.
   - Continue to the final segment towards a point in the goal quadrilateral such as (19.0, 19.0).

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Starting point, within start set
    (5.0, 1.0),   # Next waypoint, linear movement
    (9.0, 7.03),  # Reaching the first breakpoint
    (9.0, 12.0),  # Continuing on a safe path
    (9.0, 14.0),  # detour above past obstacle 2
    (12.0, 16.0), # movement towards the upper safe regions
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Final destination within the goal set
]
```

This revised path should successfully avoid the intersection with Obstacle 2 and reach the goal set while satisfying the conditions of starting within the start set and passing through at least one breakpoint.

[08/20/2024 02:17:05 PM] To adjust the path and avoid intersecting with Obstacle 5, we need to carefully analyze the spatial arrangement and choose a route that maintains a safe distance from all obstacles. Here's a step-by-step thought process:

### Analysis of Current Path and Issue:
- The initial segment from **(1.0, 1.0) to (9.0, 7.03)** is valid and correctly passes through the first breakpoint.
- Continuing from **(9.0, 7.03) to (12.0, 16.0)**, we avoid obstacles without any issues.
- The problem arises when moving from **(12.0, 16.0) to (19.0, 19.0)**. This segment intersects with Obstacle 5.

### Strategy for Adjustment:
1. **Avoid Intersecting with Obstacle 5:**
   - The path could be shifted further south after reaching (12.0, 16.0) before moving toward the target, ensuring it skirts below or between the complications presented by the obstacles.

2. **Addition of Waypoints:**
   - Introduce waypoints that detour around the region where Obstacle 5 becomes problematic.

3. **Breakpoints:**
   - Maintain the requirement of passing through a breakpoint. The current path successfully does this at (9.0, 7.03).

### Revised Path Proposal:
- Start from the bottom-left corner of the start quadrilateral at **(1.0, 1.0)**.
- Move to the right along the x-axis to **(5.0, 1.0)**.
- Go diagonally towards the first breakpoint at **(9.0, 7.03)**.
- Proceed upward to **(9.0, 12.0)** and maintain a safe upward distance, heading to **(9.0, 14.0)**, then to **(12.0, 16.0)**.
- To avoid Obstacle 5, divert the path after **(12.0, 16.0)**:
  - Make a slight detour south to **(11.0, 15.0)**.
  - Curve upwards to **(13.0, 17.0)**, steering clear of Obstacle 5.
  - Finally, move toward the goal area at **(19.0, 19.0)**.

Here's the new path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    
    (5.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 7.03),
    (9.0, 12.0),
    (9.0, 14.0),
    (12.0, 16.0),
    (11.0, 15.0),
    (13.0, 17.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)    
]
```

### Explanation:
- **(1.0, 1.0) to (5.0, 1.0):** Move eastward for initial positioning.
- **(5.0, 1.0) to (9.0, 7.03):** Move upwards and northeast to reach the breakpoint.
- **(9.0, 7.03) to (12.0, 16.0):** Navigate through the safe zones until the problematic area.
- **After (12.0, 16.0),** head south to **(11.0, 15.0)**, turn towards **(13.0, 17.0)**, finishing the path at **(19.0, 19.0)** within the goal set, all while circumventing Obstacle 5.

This revised route should satisfy the requirements, avoiding the noted intersection with Obstacle 5.

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(1.0, 1.0), (5.0, 1.0), (9.0, 7.03), (9.0, 12.0), (9.0, 14.0), (12.0, 16.0), (11.0, 15.0), (13.0, 17.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
new_path = [
    [0.5, 0.5], # start in the start set
    [0.0, 5.25], # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    [3.75, 5.25], # move rightwards to reach the gap
    [4.5, 4.5] # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/20/2024 02:17:15 PM] To address the issues with the initial path and ensure a valid path is found while avoiding obstacles, let's analyze the problem and make the necessary adjustments:

### Analysis

1. **Start and End Points:**
   - The current starting point `(1.0, 1.0)` is inside the start set and is correct.
   - The endpoint `(19.0, 19.0)` is also inside the goal set and is correct.

2. **Obstacle Intersection:**
   - The path segment from `(13.0, 17.0)` to `(19.0, 19.0)` intersects with Obstacle 5.

3. **Valid Breakpoint:**
   - The path currently goes through the breakpoint `(9.0, 7.03)`, which is a requirement.

4. **Longest Valid Subpath:**
   - The longest valid path ends at `(13.0, 17.0)` before intersecting an obstacle.

### Path Adjustment Strategy

- Since the path intersected with Obstacle 5, the goal is to reroute the path after the last valid point `(13.0, 17.0)`.
- Given that the segment after `(13.0, 17.0)` leads directly into an obstacle, we need to modify the trajectory to skirt around this obstacle while still heading towards the goal set.

### New Path Proposal

1. **Redirect after the last valid point**: After reaching `(13.0, 17.0)`, change course to avoid Obstacle 5.

2. **Skirting around the top edge of Obstacle 5**:
   - Move around `(16.5, 17.0)`, staying clear of the obstacle.

3. **Approach the goal set from a safer angle**:
   - Move to `(18.0, 18.5)`, which is above the obstacle boundary, then proceed to the goal set.

### New Path

Here's the proposed new path with safer routing:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start Point
    (5.0, 1.0),   # Intermediate point towards breakpoint
    (9.0, 7.03),  # Breakpoint
    (9.0, 12.0),  # Intermediate points to extend the path safely
    (9.0, 14.0),
    (12.0, 16.0), # Continuing progression
    (13.0, 17.0), # Last valid point
    (16.5, 17.0), # Divert path around top-right edge of Obstacle 5
    (18.0, 18.5), # Route safely above the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End in the goal set
]
```

This path adjusts the last segments to circumvent Obstacle 5 safely and ensure that the path arrives at the goal without intersecting any obstacles. By repositioning the endpoint within the goal set, the path will maintain compliance with the problem requirements.
