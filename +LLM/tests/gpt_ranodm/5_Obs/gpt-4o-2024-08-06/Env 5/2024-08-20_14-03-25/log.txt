# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[9.3, 13.4], [9.2, 10.2], [18.1, 5.5], [18.8, 8.1]]
			Obstacle 2: [[18.0, 17.0], [18.4, 15.9], [19.1, 15.6], [18.3, 16.7]]

			Obstacle 4: [[16.8, 11.8], [19.5, 10.3], [18.5, 16.2], [17.4, 13.9]]
			Obstacle 5: [[12.1, 13.9], [1.1, 19.3], [8.4, 13.6], [11.9, 13.1]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 5.76), (9.0, 18.71)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.

[08/20/2024 02:03:30 PM] To plan a path that meets all the given requirements, we need to carefully choose waypoints that avoid obstacles and pass through the required breakpoints while starting and ending in the designated areas. Here's a proposed path:

### New Path Proposal
1. **Start in the Start Position:** Begin with a point in the start area, ensuring it is comfortably within the given quadrilateral.

2. **Breakpoint:** Include a path passing through one of the given breakpoints from Breakpoint Set 1.

3. **Navigation:** Carefully position waypoints to navigate around the obstacles, maintaining a safe distance from each.

4. **End in Goal Position:** Conclude the path inside the goal area by selecting a final waypoint within the goal quadrilateral.

Here is a suitable path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),       # Start in the Start Position
    (9.0, 5.76),      # Pass through the first Breakpoint from Set 1
    (12.0, 8.0),      # Move towards a safe gap between obstacles
    (14.0, 14.0),     # Navigate between obstacles 3 and 4
    (17.5, 17.5),     # Continue upwards, avoiding other obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)      # End in the Goal Position
]
```

### Rationale:

- **Start Point:** (1.0, 1.0) is a safe choice inside the start quadrilateral.
- **Breakpoint:** The chosen breakpoint (9.0, 5.76) is from the specified set and allows a clear transition to the next point.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** The path strategically steers clear of all obstacles by selecting waypoints that bypass obstacle quadrants horizontally or diagonally.
- **End Point:** (19.0, 19.0) lies within the end quadrilateral, thus meeting the requirement of ending in the goal set.

This path ensures all conditions are met, with waypoints thoughtfully chosen to avoid danger zones around the obstacles while respecting the start, breakpoint, and end conditions.

[08/20/2024 02:03:39 PM] In order to adjust the path to avoid intersecting with obstacles while still satisfying all requirements, we need to carefully consider the spatial relationships and the existing valid subpath. Here's the thought process and adjustments made:

1. **Initial Analysis**:
   - The initial part of the provided path is valid up to the waypoint (12.0, 8.0).
   - Segment 3, which connects (12.0, 8.0) to (14.0, 14.0), intersects with Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3. Thus, adjustments need to be made from this point onward to avoid these obstacles.
   - The path must pass through one of the breakpoints from each set, so we should maintain (9.0, 5.76) as it is a required breakpoint.

2. **Obstacle Avoidance**:
   - From the valid waypoint (12.0, 8.0), we need to navigate around the edges of Obstacle 3 while avoiding Obstacle 1.
   - Obstacle 3 creates a blocking region between (12.0, 8.0) and an upper trajectory. We need to bypass it by heading slightly to the west or east and then north.
   - Similarly, Obstacle 1 presents a constraint that we must smoothly navigate around its perimeter.

3. **Path Adjustment**:
   - Consider moving from (12.0, 8.0) toward a region clear of Obstacle 3, without approaching too closely to any obstacle.
   - Choose a point around (11.0, 10.0) to navigate around the start edge of Obstacle 3.
   - Move to a higher position, say (11.5, 15.0), to rise above Obstacle 1 and 3, making sure to keep a safe distance from all obstacles.
   - From there, continue towards the goal by aiming for a waypoint closer to the desired path, like (17.0, 17.0), which clears the area.

4. **Completion**:
   - Finally, we can complete the path with a linear path to the end point in the goal set, e.g., (19.0, 19.0).

Based on these adjustments, the new path without intersecting the obstacles while respecting the path requirements could be structured as:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),       # Start point within the start set
    (9.0, 5.76),      # Required breakpoint
    (12.0, 8.0),      # Valid waypoint from previous path
    (11.0, 10.0),     # New waypoint avoiding obstacles
    (11.5, 15.0),     # Navigate safely above obstacles
    (17.0, 17.0),     # Approach the goal area
    (19.0, 19.0)      # End point within the goal set
]
```

This adjusted path keeps the path both non-crossing and efficient while satisfying all the given constraints.

[08/20/2024 02:03:50 PM] To correct the path based on the feedback provided, we need to ensure that all path segments avoid intersecting any obstacles, while maintaining our start and end points within their respective quadrilateral sets and ensuring we pass through a designated breakpoint.

### Analysis and Strategy:
1. **Start and End Points**: Our start and end points are correct as they lie within the start and goal sets.
2. **Current Path**: The longest valid subpath is [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 5.76), (12.0, 8.0)].
3. **Problematic Segment**: The segment between (12.0, 8.0) and (11.0, 10.0) crosses Obstacle 1. This requires redirecting this segment to avoid the obstacle.
4. **Obstacle Analysis**: To correct the problematic segment, we need to avoid the following obstacles:
   - **Obstacle 1**: Which our path is intersecting around the coordinates of (9.3, 13.4), (9.2, 10.2), (18.1, 5.5), and (18.8, 8.1).
   
5. **Path Adjustment Strategy**:
   - Identify a new waypoint after (12.0, 8.0) that circumvents Obstacle 1, ideally below or around it.
   - Consider an alternative path that steers clear of other obstacles and still heads towards the goal.

### New Pathway Proposal:
Let's construct a path by adding a new waypoint that detours around Obstacle 1, further adjusting to avoid other obstacles:

1. **Starting Point**: Retain the start point at (1.0, 1.0).
2. **Waypoint**: Continue through the valid waypoint (9.0, 5.76).
3. **Obstacle Avoidance**: Instead of going directly to (11.0, 10.0) from (12.0, 8.0), let's add waypoints to circumnavigate the obstacle.
4. **Around Obstacle 1**: New waypoints:
   - Move from (12.0, 8.0) slightly right and up to bypass below the corner of the obstacle: (13.0, 7.0).
   - From there, another waypoint that safely directs us towards the goal and keeps a safe distance from Obstacle 1: (14.0, 10.0).
5. **To the Goal**: From there, continue towards the goal set:
   - (14.0, 10.0) to (15.0, 18.0), skirting further obstacles from a safe distance,
   - Finally move into the goal set through (19.0, 19.0).

### Revised Path:
```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Starting point
    (9.0, 5.76),   # Valid waypoint and part of a breakpoint
    (12.0, 8.0),   # Continuing the valid subpath
    (13.0, 7.0),   # New waypoint to start circumventing Obstacle 1
    (14.0, 10.0),  # A strategic detour avoiding Obstacle 1
    (15.0, 18.0),  # Steering towards goal with obstacle clearance
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Ending point inside the goal set
]
```

This suggested path should effectively bypass the obstacles while maintaining valid path requirements from start to finish.

[08/20/2024 02:04:02 PM] To solve this motion planning task, I will identify a new path that begins within the start set, passes through a breakpoint, and avoids intersecting any obstacles while ending within the goal set. I'll address why the initial path failed and outline a new sequence of waypoints.

### Initial Path Analysis

1. **Waypoints:**
   - Start: (1.0, 1.0)
   - Breakpoint: (9.0, 5.76)
   - Problematic Segment: (13.0, 7.0) to (14.0, 10.0)

2. **Obstacle Intersection:**
   - Segment from (13.0, 7.0) to (14.0, 10.0) intersects with Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3.

3. **Valid Partial Path:**
   - Longest valid subpath before intersection: [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 5.76), (12.0, 8.0), (13.0, 7.0)]

Now, let's adjust this path to avoid intersection.

### New Path Proposal

To avoid intersections, we must carefully navigate around identified obstacles. Here's my thought process for creating a new path:

1. **Starting Point:**
   - Begin at (1.0, 1.0), inside the start set.

2. **Breakpoints:**
   - We successfully passed through Breakpoint (9.0, 5.76), so we can continue from here.

3. **Path Adjustment to Avoid Obstacles:**
   - From (13.0, 7.0), the new path will avoid the problematic segment by taking an alternate route:
   - Instead of (13.0, 7.0) to (14.0, 10.0), I will choose a route that bypasses closely contested areas.

4. **Adjustments Around Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3:**
   - Add a waypoint before entering the critical segment - choose a point that detours the region around Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3.

5. **Final Path to Goal Set:**
   - Ensure the path reaches the goal set with a clear, obstacle-free path.

### New Path Waypoints

The newly proposed waypoints are designed to navigate safely around the obstacles:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start from the valid point within the start set
    (9.0, 5.76),     # First breakpoint, already validated
    (12.0, 8.0),     # Continue from valid subpath
    (14.5, 8.0),     # Divert to avoid intersections with obstacles
    (17.5, 11.0),    # Safely navigate around the obstacle space
    (18.5, 18.0),    # Move towards the goal set, staying clear of all obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)     # End within the goal set
]
```

This new path avoids any direct intersections with obstacles and fulfills the requirement of passing through a breakpoint while starting and ending in their respective sets.

[08/20/2024 02:04:12 PM] To correct the path, let's first evaluate why the original path intersected with obstacles and how adjustments can be made to avoid them.

### Analysis

1. **Start and End Points**: 
   - The path correctly starts at (1.0, 1.0), within the start set, and ends at points within the goal ranging to (19.0, 19.0), all successfully adhering to the path constraints.

2. **Problematic Segment**:
   - The segment from (12.0, 8.0) to (14.5, 8.0) intersects with Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3. The issue primarily arises because these obstacles extend between these coordinates as part of their bounding quadrilaterals, creating blockage.

3. **Obstacle Avoidance**:
   - To correct the path, a detour must be planned that avoids these two obstacles. Given that the path must include a breakpoint from the provided set, maintaining passage through the initial successful points (up to (12.0, 8.0)) and finding an alternative path around these obstacles is critical.

### Path Adjustments

- Continue from the last valid point that does not intersect with any obstacles, which is (12.0, 8.0).
  
- **Bypass Obstacles**: 
  - Since Obstacle 1 and 3 are to the east-southeast from (12.0, 8.0), we should look for a path that ascends or curves between available space to avoid intersecting with them.
  
- One viable strategy is to ascend north slightly, bypass the obstacles on their western edge, and then navigate east once they are cleared.

### Revised Path Plan

From the existing path, utilize the valid subpath:
- Move from (12.0, 8.0) to (12.0, 10.0) – a northern stop that elevates the path clear from the lower quadrilateral edge of the obstacles.
- From (12.0, 10.0), go slightly northeast to (14.0, 12.0) – maintain a clearance by moving in a diagonal to avoid collision with the nearby obstacles.
- Navigate a route to (17.0, 15.0) – this point comfortably positions itself between recognized obstacles, providing ample room for navigation.
- Last segment moves directly or diagonally to the goal endpoint, avoiding further obstacles by planning this terminal segment as a well-assessed straight line.

### New Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start in the start set
    (9.0, 5.76),     # Via first valid break point
    (12.0, 8.0),     # Last valid segment before encountering obstacles
    (12.0, 10.0),    # Northward adjustment to avoid lower bounds of obstacles
    (14.0, 12.0),    # Diagonal movement to bypass obstacles safely
    (17.0, 15.0),    # Clear of obstacles, approaching the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)     # End in the goal set
]
```

This path averts obstacles by using spatial navigation to circumvent the intercept sites of Obstacle 1 and 3. Each segment is positioned to maintain a safe distance while respecting path requirements.

    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
new_path = [
    [0.5, 0.5], # start in the start set
    [0.0, 5.25], # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    [3.75, 5.25], # move rightwards to reach the gap
    [4.5, 4.5] # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

### Start and Valid Subpath
The initial path starts from the point (1.0, 1.0) within the start set and includes the breakpoint (9.0, 5.76). The valid subpath [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 5.76), (12.0, 8.0)] successfully avoids any obstacles, indicating that this segment of the path is appropriate. However, it's important to address the intersection that occurs in the subsequent segment.

### Problematic Segment
The problematic segment is between points (12.0, 8.0) and (12.0, 10.0), which intersects with Obstacle 1. Upon examining the obstacle coordinates for Obstacle 1 ([[9.3, 13.4], [9.2, 10.2], [18.1, 5.5], [18.8, 8.1]]), it's apparent that the path must be adjusted to circumvent the area occupied by the obstacle while maintaining a path close to the goal.

### Path Adjustments
1. **New Waypoint Direction**: Since the segment (12.0, 8.0) to (12.0, 10.0) intersects Obstacle 1, a new route needs to be improvised around this obstacle. By moving slightly westwards or southwards from the point (12.0, 8.0), the path can safely detour around the bottom edge of Obstacle 1.
   
2. **Continuation Around Obstacle**: From (12.0, 8.0), move to a new waypoint such as (11.5, 7.5) to avoid the obstacle's boundary. Then, continuing moving up and adjusting further:
   - Navigate to (10.0, 9.5), staying clear of the obstacle border.

3. **Re-entry into a Clear Path**: After the obstacle, we can safely redirect towards the goal set:
   - Proceed to (15.0, 13.0).
   - Approaching the goal, a waypoint like (17.0, 15.0) ensures we're navigating through open space.

4. **Reaching the Goal**: Finally, end at (19.0, 19.0) inside the goal set.

With these adjustments, each segment of the path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles while ensuring it terminates correctly within the goal area.

## New Path Proposal
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start point in start set
    (9.0, 5.76), # Breakpoint
    (12.0, 8.0), # Part of the valid subpath
    (11.5, 7.5), # New waypoint to avoid Obstacle 1 
    (10.0, 9.5), # Bypass the obstacle
    (15.0, 13.0),# Continue towards goal
    (17.0, 15.0),# Navigate close to the goal
    (19.0, 19.0) # End point in goal set
]
```

This new path adheres to the start, end, and obstacle avoidance requirements and integrates logical rerouting around identified problematic areas.
