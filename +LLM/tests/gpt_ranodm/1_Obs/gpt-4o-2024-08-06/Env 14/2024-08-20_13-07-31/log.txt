# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[14.6, 14.1], [15.4, 10.7], [17.5, 6.5], [15.0, 13.1]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 10.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
new_path = [
    [0.5, 0.5], # start in the start set
    [0.0, 5.25], # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    [3.75, 5.25], # move rightwards to reach the gap
    [4.5, 4.5] # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/20/2024 01:07:37 PM] To design a path that meets the requirements given, we'll start in the designated Start Position, navigate through a required Breakpoint, and finish in the Goal Position while avoiding the provided obstacle. Since we have coordinates for everything, let's create a potential path:

1. **Start Point:** We'll start at a convenient point inside the Start Quadrilateral.
2. **Breakpoint:** We'll navigate the path through the Breakpoint Set 1.
3. **Avoid Obstacles:** We'll ensure our path maintains a safe distance from the specified obstacle.
4. **End Point:** Finally, we'll end at a point within the Goal Quadrilateral.

### New Path Proposal
Assuming no vertical or horizontal lines are necessary, distances from obstacles are maintained, and the start and finish inside their respective quadrilaterals:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # A chosen start point inside the Start Quadrilateral
    (9.0, 10.0),  # Chosen Breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1
    (16.0, 17.0), # A waypoint added to ensure the path doesn't touch or cross the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)  # A chosen end point inside the Goal Quadrilateral
]
```

### Explanation
- **Start Point (1.0, 1.0):** This point lies clearly within the Start Quadrilateral.
- **Breakpoint (9.0, 10.0):** This is the selected Breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1, ensuring we satisfy the requirement to pass through this set.
- **Waypoint (16.0, 17.0):** By choosing this point, we ensure that the path remains clear of the obstacle and maintains safe spacing.
- **End Point (19.0, 19.0):** This point is strategically within the Goal Quadrilateral, ensuring the path finishes appropriately.

This new path meets all stated requirements for start and endpoints, breakpoint usage, and obstacle avoidance.
