# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[13.9, 19.6], [15.8, 13.9], [16.4, 14.6], [15.5, 19.4]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 10.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
new_path = [
    [0.5, 0.5], # start in the start set
    [0.0, 5.25], # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate

[08/20/2024 01:02:32 PM] To devise a path from the given start set to the goal set while avoiding obstacles, let's analyze the provided data:

### Provided Data:

- **Start Position (Quadrilateral):** 
  [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
- **Goal Position (Quadrilateral):**
  [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
- **Obstacles:**
  - Obstacle 1: [[13.9, 19.6], [15.8, 13.9], [16.4, 14.6], [15.5, 19.4]]
- **Breakpoint:**
  - Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 10.0)]

### Path Planning Strategy:

1. **Choose a Starting Point:** Select a point comfortably within the start quadrilateral. We can start at (1.0, 1.0).
2. **Goal Selection:** A suitable endpoint within the goal quadrilateral could be (19.0, 19.0).
3. **Avoid the Obstacle:** The obstacle is situated approximately in the area [13.9, 19.6] to [16.4, 14.6]. To avoid it, remain well clear of the obstacle's bounding area.
4. **Breakpoints:** Ensure the path passes through (9.0, 10.0).

### Proposed Path:

The path will start at (1.0, 1.0), move to (9.0, 10.0) to pass through the breakpoint, and then, moving in a way to circumvent the obstacle, conclude at (19.0, 19.0).

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),        # Start point within the start set.
    (9.0, 10.0),       # Pass through the breakpoint.
    (12.0, 12.0),      # Navigate towards the goal, ensuring clearance from the obstacle.
    (14.5, 16.0),      # Mid-route waypoint to steer clear of obstacle boundaries.
    (19.0, 19.0)       # End point within the goal set.
]
```

This path strategically uses a set of waypoints to navigate efficiently from the start to the goal while ensuring the avoidance of the defined obstacle and passing through the mandatory breakpoint.

[08/20/2024 01:02:42 PM] To correct the path so it avoids intersection with the given obstacles, we need to follow a few steps and revise our plan.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Start Point**: The path starts in the start position correctly.
2. **Endpoint**: The path terminates inside the goal set appropriately.
3. **Intersection with Obstacles**: The current path intersects with Obstacle 1 between the points (14.5, 16.0) and (19.0, 19.0). This needs adjustment.
4. **Breakpoints**: The path passes the necessary breakpoint at (9.0, 10.0).

### Plan

1. **Analyze Obstacle Position**: Understand the position of the obstacle relative to the current path. Obstacle 1 shows that the initial path from (14.5, 16.0) to (19.0, 19.0) intersects with it. This means we need to find an alternate route around or adjusting waypoints to avoid the obstacle.

2. **Navigating around Obstacle**: The path needs to honestly navigate the obstacle’s area effectively while keeping within acceptable bounds and avoiding close encounters.

3. **Maintain Breakpoints and Valid Segments**: Ensuring that the path passes through any necessary breakpoints and retains valid segments is essential.

### Path Adjustment Strategy

- From the longest valid subpath, continue planning a trajectory that avoids the obstacle:
  - Utilize available space to circumvent the obstacle.
  - Introduce new waypoints strategically to reroute around the obstacle.

### Modified Path Proposal:

1. Start at (1.0, 1.0).
2. Proceed to the provided breakpoint at (9.0, 10.0).
3. Travel across to (12.0, 12.0) — the last valid point before intersection occurred.
4. Reroute slightly north from the original point, avoiding the obstacle by passing through a safe region outside the obstacle perimeter at (14.5, 14.0).
5. Move towards the goal, avoiding closer proximity to the obstacle, at waypoint (16.0, 18.0) skirting around the obstacle safely.
6. Conclude the journey inside the goal set at (19.0, 19.0) positioned closer to the target, ensuring all segments do not intersect the obstacle.

### New Path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 10.0),
    (12.0, 12.0),
    (14.5, 14.0),
    (16.0, 18.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This path should now satisfy the requirements of avoiding the obstacle while ensuring proximity to the goal area remains effective and navigable.

[08/20/2024 01:02:53 PM] To address the path planning task, my goal is to adjust the given path to ensure it avoids intersection with any obstacles and satisfies all the requirements. Let's analyze the situation:

### Current Path Analysis:

1. **Start and End Points**: The path starts within the start set and ends within the goal set correctly.
2. **Waypoint Path**: The original path used is `[(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 10.0), (12.0, 12.0), (14.5, 14.0), (16.0, 18.0), (19.0, 19.0)]`.
3. **Obstacle Intersection**: The problematic segment is between `(14.5, 14.0)` and `(16.0, 18.0)`, which intersects Obstacle 1.

### Path Correction Strategy:

1. **Valid Subpath to Continue From**: The valid subpath is `[(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 10.0), (12.0, 12.0), (14.5, 14.0)]`. I'll build upon this subpath to create the rest of the trajectory.

2. **Obstacle Avoidance**:
   - **Obstacle 1**: When we reach point `(14.5, 14.0)`, instead of proceeding to `(16.0, 18.0)`, I'll adjust the path to skim around the obstacle, maintaining a safe distance.
   - **New Waypoint**: I will introduce a new waypoint to circumnavigate around the obstacle.

3. **New Path Proposal**:
   - From `(14.5, 14.0)`, I'll add a waypoint such as `(14.0, 18.0)`, positioned north of the obstacle to avoid crossing it.
   - Then proceed to `(17.0, 18.0)`, ensuring we end up near the goal set without intersecting the obstacle.
   - Finally, conclude at `(19.0, 19.0)` in the goal set.

### New Path:

The new adjusted path considering avoidance of the obstacle:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),        # Starting point in start set
    (9.0, 10.0),       # Breakpoint set 1
    (12.0, 12.0),      # Intermediate waypoint
    (14.5, 14.0),      # Before obstacle
    (14.0, 18.0),      # New waypoint to avoid obstacle
    (17.0, 18.0),      # Before entering the goal area
    (19.0, 19.0)       # Ending point in goal set
]
```

### Key Considerations:
- **Continuity**: The new path moves smoothly from the identified valid subpath, maintaining trajectory continuity.
- **Clearance**: Adjusts to offer clearance around the obstacle while adhering to path requirements.
- **Unused Breakpoints**: Only the utilized breakpoints are retained, ensuring that path optimization considers necessary corrections only.

This adjustment should ensure a valid, obstacle-free path from the start to the goal set.

[08/20/2024 01:03:01 PM] To create a corrected path that meets the requirements and avoids obstacles, let's analyze the spatial relationships of the waypoints and the position of the obstacle.

## Analysis and Thought Process:
1. **Start and Goal Sets:** The path starts in the correct start set and ends in the correct goal set; thus, no adjustments are needed for these points.
   
2. **Bottleneck Detection:** The feedback indicates that the problematic segment is between points (14.0, 18.0) and (17.0, 18.0), which intersects with Obstacle 1. We need to adjust this segment to avoid intersecting the obstacle.

3. **Obstacles:**   
   - **Obstacle 1:** [(13.9, 19.6), (15.8, 13.9), (16.4, 14.6), (15.5, 19.4)]
   - The obstacle seems to extend significantly in the vertical range, particularly affecting the segment between points (14.0, 18.0) and (17.0, 18.0).

4. **Breakpoint:** The path successfully passes through Breakpoint Set 1: (9.0, 10.0), which is a requirement.

5. **Path Adjustment Strategy:**
   - We avoid the problematic path section by moving vertically and/or horizontally around the obstacle. Since the intersection occurs almost just before the segment towards point (17.0, 18.0), we can maneuver the path upwards or around the obstacle by adding more waypoints or adjusting current points to guide around the obstacle safely.

## Adjusted Path Plan:
1. Start within the start set at (1.0, 1.0).
2. Continue through the valid path: (9.0, 10.0), (12.0, 12.0), (14.5, 14.0), (14.0, 18.0).
3. From (14.0, 18.0), avoid the obstacle by moving vertically upwards to a point safely above the obstacle.
4. Adjust a waypoint to the right safely outside the obstacle’s influence, e.g., (17.0, 20.0).
5. Proceed to the goal set by moving downward to (19.0, 19.0).

## New Path:
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),         # Start in start set
    (9.0, 10.0),        # Pass through Breakpoint Set 1
    (12.0, 12.0),      
    (14.5, 14.0),      
    (14.0, 18.0),       # Last valid point before the crossing
    (17.0, 20.0),       # Move upwards to avoid the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)        # Reach the goal set
]

This path adjustment keeps the trajectory within the permissible regions while steering clear of obstacles and ensuring it meets all the original specifications.

[08/20/2024 01:03:08 PM] To correct and revise the path based on the feedback provided, let’s analyze the situation step by step:

### Summary of the Situation
1. **Start and Goal Positions**: The path correctly begins within the designated start area and ends within the goal area.
2. **Obstacle Interaction**: The feedback indicates that Segment 5 of the existing path, which connects waypoints (14.0, 18.0) and (17.0, 20.0), crosses through Obstacle 1.
3. **Breakpoints**: The path correctly passes through the given breakpoint (9.0, 10.0).

### Analysis of the Path
- The valid subpath till the segment crossing the obstacle is: [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 10.0), (12.0, 12.0), (14.5, 14.0), (14.0, 18.0)].
  
### Obstacle Avoidance
To adjust the path, we need to find a way around the problematic segment:
- Obstacle 1 has vertices: [(13.9, 19.6), (15.8, 13.9), (16.4, 14.6), (15.5, 19.4)].
  
To avoid this obstacle:
1. **Understanding the Obstacle**: The segment between (14.0, 18.0) and (17.0, 20.0) crosses this boundary. This occurs due to the directness of the path nearing the obstacle’s coordinates closely.

2. **Solution Strategy**:
   - Redirect around the obstacle by choosing waypoints that detour slightly, maintaining a safe distance from its vertices.
   - Ensure the next segments maintain clearance from all edges and the internal area of the obstacle.

### Suggested New Path
A revised path avoiding the obstacle might be:
- Start with the validated waypoint sequence until the problematic segment.
- Introduce a waypoint after (14.0, 18.0) to navigate around the obstacle safely.
  
Based on these insights, here is the revised path:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),        # Start in the start set
    (9.0, 10.0),       # Pass through given breakpoint
    (12.0, 12.0),      # Maintain path toward goal without crossing obstacles
    (14.5, 14.0),      # Approach with care around obstacle
    (14.0, 18.0),      # Last valid point before need for redirection
    (15.0, 16.0),      # New waypoint to bypass the obstacle from the side
    (17.0, 17.0),      # Continuing ahead avoiding corners/vertices
    (19.0, 19.0)       # Ending within the goal set
]
```

### Ensuring Correct Path Execution
In your path planning, always verify:
- Path does not touch or cross boundaries of obstacles.
- Provides clearance in situations with close segments.
- Traverse through required checkpoints (breakpoints) to meet path validity criteria.

This revised path should steeringly bypass the encountered obstacle while fulfilling the path requirements and constraints.

[08/20/2024 01:03:17 PM] To correct the path and ensure it successfully avoids obstacles while meeting all requirements, let's break down the problem and propose adjustments:

### Analysis of the Provided Path

1. **Current Path**: 
    - Starts at (1.0, 1.0).
    - Important Waypoints: It passes through the required breakpoint at (9.0, 10.0).

2. **Path Analysis**:
    - The segment from (15.0, 16.0) to (17.0, 17.0) intersects with Obstacle 1. 
    - Up to (15.0, 16.0), the path is valid.

3. **Obstacle Description**:
    - Obstacle 1 is located approximately between (13.9,13.9) and (16.4,19.6), forming a quadrilateral.
 
### Path Correction Strategy

1. **Avoid the Obstacle**:
    - The problematic segment is between (15.0, 16.0) and (17.0, 17.0). We need to reroute this segment to avoid the obstacle.
    - Instead of going directly from (15.0, 16.0) to (17.0, 17.0), we should introduce an intermediary waypoint that moves around the obstacle.

2. **Introduce New Waypoints**:
    - Move slightly to the east and north of (15.0, 16.0) before reaching (17.0, 17.0), ensuring the route stays clear of the obstacle's bounds.
    - A possible route can be to divert towards (16.0, 16.5) and then move to (16.8, 17.5) to maintain clearance.

3. **Maintain Route Validity**:
    - Make sure the new points maintain linear connectivity and avoid unintentionally creating intersections with the obstacle's edges.

### Proposed New Path 

The modified path with its waypoints adjusted to avoid intersections is as follows:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),        # Starting point within the Start Position
