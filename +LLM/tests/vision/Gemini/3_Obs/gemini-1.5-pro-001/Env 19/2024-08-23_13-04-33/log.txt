# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[10.3, 15.5], [15.0, 10.5], [19.1, 15.1], [15.1, 16.2]]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.

[08/23/2024 01:04:48 PM] The current path collides with Obstacle 2 because it attempts to move directly upwards at the breakpoint. 
To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around Obstacle 2. 

One approach is to move to the right after the first breakpoint, putting the path in a position to go around Obstacle 2.
Then, the path can proceed upwards to the goal area.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 13.18), # Pass through the breakpoint 
    (14.0, 13.18), # Move right to a position clear of Obstacle 2
    (14.0, 20.0), # Move upwards to the level of the goal set
    (20.0, 20.0)  # Move right to the goal within the goal set

    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.

[08/23/2024 01:05:19 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 2. Since we can't move straight up from the breakpoint (9.0, 13.18), we need to find a way around the obstacle. 

One option is to move to the right, clear of Obstacle 2, before continuing upwards.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), # Start point 
    (9.0, 13.18), # Breakpoint
    (13.0, 13.18), # Move right, clear of Obstacle 2 
    (13.0, 17.0), # Move upwards, clear of Obstacle 2 
    (16.0, 17.0), # Continue towards the goal
    (16.0, 20.0), 
    (20.0, 20.0)  # End point
]
```

This path first moves to the right, ensuring a safe distance from Obstacle 2, and then continues upwards to rejoin the original path and reach the goal.
