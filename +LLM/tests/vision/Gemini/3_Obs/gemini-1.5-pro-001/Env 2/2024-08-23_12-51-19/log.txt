# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

[08/23/2024 12:51:37 PM] The current path collides with obstacle 3 because it attempts to cross it directly. To circumvent this, we can adjust the path to go around obstacle 3. 

Analyzing the environment, we see that we can route the path above obstacle 3 by making use of the breakpoint (9.0, 16.47) from Breakpoint set 1. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start point within the start set
    (9.0, 6.62),  # First breakpoint
    (9.0, 16.47), # Second breakpoint (above obstacle 3)
    (16.0, 16.47),# Move right, staying above obstacle 3 
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End point within the goal set 
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles:

* It maintains a safe distance from obstacle 1 by moving directly to the first breakpoint.
* It clears obstacle 2 by utilizing the higher second breakpoint.
* It steers clear of obstacle 3 by staying above it throughout its trajectory.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response

[08/23/2024 12:51:45 PM] The issue arises when the path tries to go from  `(9.0, 6.62)` to `(9.0, 16.47)` in a straight line, directly through Obstacle 2. To avoid this, we can route the path around the left side of Obstacle 2. 

Let's adjust the path like this:

1. **From the valid subpath:** We can continue from the last valid point `(9.0, 6.62)`.
2. **Going around Obstacle 2:**  We need to move left and upward to avoid Obstacle 2. A good waypoint could be `(6.0, 10.0)`. This puts us clear of Obstacle 2.
3. **Heading towards the goal:** From `(6.0, 10.0)` we can move towards the goal area. A waypoint like `(16.0, 16.47)` puts us in a good position to reach the goal.
4. **Reaching the goal:** Finally, we can connect to the goal set with the point `(19.0, 19.0)`.

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 6.62), (6.0, 10.0), (16.0, 16.47), (19.0, 19.0)]

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
