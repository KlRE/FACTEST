# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.4, 11.1], [15.5, 8.9], [19.4, 8.8], [19.2, 9.6]]
			Obstacle 2: [[15.0, 13.4], [6.9, 5.2], [11.5, 5.9], [19.1, 11.6]]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.

    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

[08/23/2024 01:04:03 PM] The path needs to navigate around obstacle 2. To do this, we can adjust the path to first go above obstacle 2 before heading towards the goal. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```python
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0),    # Start point
    (9.0, 1.76),   # Breakpoint 1
    (9.0, 15.0),   # Move above obstacle 2
    (16.0, 18.0),  # Head towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(2.0, 1.0) & (9.0, 1.76):** These points remain the same, as they are valid.
2. **(9.0, 15.0):**  We introduce a new waypoint above obstacle 2. By moving to a y-coordinate of 15.0, we ensure a clear path above the obstacle.
3. **(16.0, 18.0) & (19.0, 19.0):**  These points remain similar to the original path, allowing us to reach the goal area without intersecting any obstacles.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.4, 11.1], [15.5, 8.9], [19.4, 8.8], [19.2, 9.6]]
			Obstacle 2: [[15.0, 13.4], [6.9, 5.2], [11.5, 5.9], [19.1, 11.6]]

[08/23/2024 01:04:20 PM] The current path gets stuck because it tries to pass through breakpoint (9.0, 14.66) which is in an obstacle. The key is to utilize the lower breakpoint (9.0, 1.76) and navigate around the obstacles on the right. 

Here's a possible new path:

```python
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 1.76),  # Pass through the lower breakpoint of Set 1
    (11.0, 2.0),  # Move slightly right and up, staying clear of Obstacle 2
    (11.0, 8.0),  # Move straight up, staying clear of Obstacles 2 and 3
    (16.0, 10.0), # Move right, carefully navigating between Obstacles 2 and 3
    (18.0, 19.0)   # Move towards the goal set
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Utilize lower breakpoint:** Instead of trying to reach the blocked upper breakpoint, the new path focuses on using the lower breakpoint (9.0, 1.76), which is clear of obstacles. 
2. **Navigate around Obstacles:** From the breakpoint, the path carefully maneuvers around the obstacles:
    - It first takes a slight detour to the right (11.0, 2.0) to avoid the bottom corner of Obstacle 2.
    - It then moves straight up (11.0, 8.0), staying clear of both Obstacles 2 and 3.
    - It proceeds right (16.0, 10.0), carefully navigating the space between Obstacles 2 and 3.
3. **Reach the goal:** Finally, the path heads directly towards the goal set (18.0, 19.0).

This path avoids all obstacles while passing through the required breakpoints and reaching the goal.
