# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[12.1, 17.4], [10.1, 14.5], [10.5, 9.0], [13.0, 11.2]]
			Obstacle 2: [[18.9, 14.9], [15.9, 17.3], [16.3, 14.9], [18.7, 13.9]]
			Obstacle 3: [[3.0, 11.4], [15.0, 16.2], [10.6, 17.1], [3.8, 16.6]]
			Obstacle 4: [[12.6, 14.2], [17.3, 3.3], [15.5, 9.7], [14.5, 11.9]]
			Obstacle 5: [[19.9, 1.7], [16.3, 7.4], [16.8, 6.1], [19.2, 2.5]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 5.9), (9.0, 19.49)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 19.49), (19.0, 19.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 1 between points (1.0, 1.0) and (9.0, 19.49) intersects with obstacle(s):

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(1.0, 1.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[08/23/2024 01:26:59 PM] The current path fails because it tries to cross obstacle 3. The path needs to be adjusted to go around this obstacle. Looking at the environment, there seems to be a good path going above all the obstacles:
1. Keep the start point and the first waypoint the same, as they are valid.
2. Instead of going straight up, aim for a point to the right and above obstacle 3, for example (16, 18). This avoids crossing any obstacles.
3. From this new waypoint, the path can reach the goal set without crossing any obstacles.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[12.1, 17.4], [10.1, 14.5], [10.5, 9.0], [13.0, 11.2]]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 5.9), (16.0, 18.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

[08/23/2024 01:27:07 PM] The initial path segment from (9.0, 5.9) to (16.0, 18.0) cuts through obstacles 1, 3, and 4. To circumvent this, we can adjust the path to first navigate around the left side of obstacle 1.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Starting point within the start set
    (9.0, 5.9),   # Breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1
    (8.0, 9.0),   # Navigate left around Obstacle 1
    (8.0, 16.0),   # Move upward, staying clear of Obstacle 1
    (16.0, 18.0),  # Approach the goal area, avoiding Obstacle 3
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point within the goal set
]
```

This adjusted path first follows the valid subpath to the first breakpoint. It then traces a route around the left side of obstacle 1, ensuring a safe distance. From there, it moves upwards to avoid obstacle 1, proceeds towards the goal area while staying clear of obstacle 3, and finally reaches the goal set.

[08/23/2024 01:27:14 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with obstacle 3. We can achieve this by routing the path around the left side of the obstacle.

- The valid subpath ends at (8.0, 9.0). 
- From there, we can move further left to (6.0, 9.0) to avoid obstacle 3.
- Then, continue upwards to (6.0, 18.0) to clear the obstacle.
- Finally, connect to the goal set with (16.0, 18.0) and (19.0, 19.0).

[08/23/2024 01:27:24 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 3.  The valid subpath ends somewhat close to the edge of the obstacle. Therefore, a viable approach is to guide the path around the obstacle by hugging its top edge. 

Here is a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, 5.9), 
    (8.0, 9.0), 
    (6.0, 9.0),
    (4.0, 12.0), # Move left and slightly up, staying clear of Obstacle 3 
    (4.0, 17.0), # Continue upward, staying clear of Obstacle 3
    (9.0, 19.49),  # Connect to the second breakpoint 
    (16.0, 18.0), # Move towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Reach the goal
]
```

This path first follows the original path until it is close to Obstacle 3. Then, it detours around the obstacle, maintaining a safe distance. After clearing the obstacle, it connects to the second breakpoint and then proceeds to the goal.
