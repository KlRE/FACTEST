# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[08/23/2024 01:38:37 PM] The path needs adjustments to avoid obstacles. The provided path correctly uses the first breakpoint (9.0, 7.03) but fails to avoid obstacles while going upward. 

**Analyzing the environment:**

* **Obstacle 1 and 5:** The path needs to navigate around these obstacles to reach the upper section of the environment.
* **Open Space:** There's significant open space on the right side of the environment, allowing for a path that avoids most obstacles.

**Adjustments:**

1. **Utilize Open Space:** Instead of going straight up, the path can move towards the right side of the environment where there are fewer obstacles. 
2. **Navigate to Goal:** Once clear of the obstacles, the path can move upwards and then towards the goal.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start Point
    (9.0, 7.03),  # Breakpoint 1
    (12.0, 7.0), # Move right
    (12.0, 19.0), # Move up 
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Goal Point
] 
```

This new path avoids all obstacles by taking advantage of the open space in the environment.

[08/23/2024 01:38:47 PM] The current path is colliding with several obstacles as it tries to move directly upwards from (12.0, 7.0). A better strategy is to navigate around the obstacles by utilizing the available free space.

- **From the last valid waypoint (12.0, 7.0):** Move horizontally to the right, avoiding Obstacle 2 and staying clear of Obstacle 3.  
- **Continue rightward:** Navigate around the top-right corner of Obstacle 3. 
- **Move upward:** Once past Obstacle 3, proceed upward towards the goal set, making sure to stay clear of Obstacle 5.
- **Finally:** Head left towards the goal set.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]

[08/23/2024 01:39:07 PM] The initial path fails because it tries to cross obstacles 2 and 3 with a single segment. To circumvent this, we can adjust the path to go around these obstacles. 

First, we can follow the longest valid subpath provided: `[(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 7.03), (12.0, 7.0)]`. 

From `(12.0, 7.0)`, we need to navigate around obstacle 2. Let's move horizontally to the right, staying clear of obstacle 2.  A safe waypoint could be `(14.0, 7.0)`.

Next, we need to avoid obstacle 3. Observing the environment, we can move vertically upwards to `(14.0, 16.0)`, safely passing obstacle 3.

Finally, we can move horizontally to the left to reach the goal set at `(19.0, 16.0)`.

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, 7.03), 
    (12.0, 7.0), 
    (14.0, 7.0),
