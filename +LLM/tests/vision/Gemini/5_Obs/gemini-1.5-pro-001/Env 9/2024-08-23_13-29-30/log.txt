# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[16.3, 17.3], [12.4, 19.6], [12.8, 17.2], [13.4, 16.9]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.2, 17.0], [8.8, 10.8], [7.4, 17.8], [1.7, 17.7]]
			Obstacle 3: [[19.8, 16.0], [13.3, 12.9], [16.5, 5.1], [18.8, 8.0]]
			Obstacle 4: [[3.6, 16.4], [7.6, 15.4], [9.4, 19.5], [4.6, 18.3]]
			Obstacle 5: [[19.3, 17.5], [17.2, 18.1], [18.1, 15.7], [18.7, 15.4]]

[08/23/2024 01:30:15 PM] The suggested path goes through Obstacles 3 and 5. We can adjust this path by going around these obstacles.  

**Option 1**: Go around the bottom of the obstacles.
1. **From the last valid waypoint (16.0, 5.0):** Move further right, away from Obstacle 3, to approximately x = 17. 
2. **Next Waypoint:** Head downwards to a y-value that's below Obstacle 3 but above Obstacle 5, around y = 12.  Let's use (17, 12).
3. **Final Approach:**  Now clear to move right and upwards into the goal set at (19.0, 19.0).

**Option 2**: Go around the top of the obstacles. 
1. **From the last valid waypoint (16.0, 5.0):**  Move upwards to a y-value greater than the obstacles, say y = 19. Let's use (16, 19).
2. **Next Waypoint:** Move rightwards to a x-value greater than the obstacles, putting it safely within the goal set. Let's use (19, 19).

**Here are the paths based on these options:**

**new_path (Option 1):** [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 8.29), (9.0, 5.0), (16.0, 5.0), (17, 12), (19.0, 19.0)]

[08/23/2024 01:30:27 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacles 3 and 5. 

Currently, the path attempts to move directly from the breakpoint (9.0, 5.0) to the goal set. However, this path is blocked by Obstacles 3 and 5. To circumvent these obstacles, we can route the path to pass below Obstacle 3. 

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start point
    (9.0, 8.29),  # Breakpoint
    (9.0, 5.0),   # Move down, keeping a safe distance from Obstacle 2
    (15.0, 5.0),  # Move right, staying below Obstacle 3
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Move up to the goal
] 
```

This new path addresses the collision issue by navigating around the lower edge of Obstacle 3, providing a clear path to the goal.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[16.3, 17.3], [12.4, 19.6], [12.8, 17.2], [13.4, 16.9]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.2, 17.0], [8.8, 10.8], [7.4, 17.8], [1.7, 17.7]]
			Obstacle 3: [[19.8, 16.0], [13.3, 12.9], [16.5, 5.1], [18.8, 8.0]]
			Obstacle 4: [[3.6, 16.4], [7.6, 15.4], [9.4, 19.5], [4.6, 18.3]]
			Obstacle 5: [[19.3, 17.5], [17.2, 18.1], [18.1, 15.7], [18.7, 15.4]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 8.29), (9.0, 20.7)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 8.29), (9.0, 5.0), (15.0, 5.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 8.29), (9.0, 5.0), (15.0, 5.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

[08/23/2024 01:30:34 PM] The path needs to navigate around obstacles 3 and 5 to reach the goal. One option is to go around obstacle 3 from below and approach the goal from the right side.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start point
    (9.0, 8.29),  # Breakpoint
    (9.0, 5.0),   # Move down, clearing obstacle 2
    (15.0, 5.0),  # Move right, staying below obstacle 3
    (16.0, 5.0), # Move right, staying below obstacle 3
    (16.0, 10.0), # Move up, clearing obstacle 3
    (18.0, 10.0), # Move right towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point within the goal set 
]
```

This path first follows the valid subpath. Then it continues to move right, staying below obstacle 3. Finally, it moves up to clear obstacle 3 and proceeds right to the goal.
