# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[17.9, 17.4], [12.4, 19.7], [13.1, 15.8], [13.3, 15.5]]
			Obstacle 2: [[18.7, 10.3], [15.6, 8.1], [17.4, 5.8], [18.5, 8.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[1.2, 16.0], [8.2, 16.3], [14.2, 19.9], [5.6, 19.6]]
			Obstacle 4: [[14.0, 16.4], [1.5, 14.1], [5.4, 11.1], [12.0, 14.7]]
			Obstacle 5: [[19.5, 15.8], [10.3, 17.4], [10.6, 11.9], [15.4, 10.5]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 5.53), (9.0, 16.12), (9.0, 20.86)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.

		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[08/23/2024 01:23:41 PM] The provided path collides with obstacles 1 and 5. To circumvent this, the path needs adjustments. 

The first waypoint (1.0, 2.0) and the use of the breakpoint (9.0, 5.53) are valid. After this breakpoint, directly heading towards the goal leads to the collisions.

To avoid these obstacles, we can route the path above obstacle 5 and to the left of obstacle 1. Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0),  # Starting inside the start set
    (9.0, 5.53), # Using the provided breakpoint
    (9.0, 16.0), # Moving upwards to bypass the lower part of obstacle 5
    (16.0, 16.0), # Moving right, staying below obstacle 3 and above obstacle 5
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Reaching the goal set
] 
```

This new path avoids all obstacles while passing through the designated breakpoint and reaching the goal within the defined sets.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

[08/23/2024 01:24:08 PM] The current path fails because it directly intersects with obstacles 3 and 4. We need to find a way around these obstacles to reach the goal.

One approach is to utilize the provided breakpoints. We can first try to reach the breakpoint at (9.0, 5.53) since it is below obstacles 3 and 4. From this breakpoint, we can then try to navigate above obstacles 2 and 5 to reach the goal. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0),  # Starting point
    (9.0, 5.53), # Breakpoint 1 below obstacles 3 and 4
    (10.0, 5.53), # Move slightly right to avoid obstacle 2
    (10.0, 12.0), # Move up to a position above obstacles 2 and 5
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Move diagonally to the goal point
]
```

This path first navigates to a breakpoint that avoids the initial obstacles. Then it manoeuvres around obstacles 2 and 5 by moving slightly right and then upwards. Finally, it reaches the goal point.
