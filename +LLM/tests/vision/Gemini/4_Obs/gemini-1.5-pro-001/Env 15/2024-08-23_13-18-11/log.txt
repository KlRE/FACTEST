# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

[08/23/2024 01:18:24 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 2. Since we must use the breakpoint (9.0, 5.98) and the path is invalid from there, we need to rethink the approach.

1. **Starting Point:** We can begin from the previous valid point (9.0, 5.98).
2. **Maneuvering Obstacles:**  We need to navigate above obstacles 2 and 4. Increasing the y-coordinate to a value greater than the highest point of obstacle 4 (which is approximately y=19.4) will ensure this.
3. **Reaching the Goal:** From the position above obstacle 4, we can plot a direct path to the goal set.

Therefore, a corrected path could be:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, 5.98), 
    (9.0, 20.0), # Move above obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)  # proceed to the goal
]

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[18.4, 6.9], [12.0, 5.2], [12.2, 2.0], [19.5, 1.1]]

[08/23/2024 01:19:08 PM] The path needs to navigate around Obstacle 2 to reach the goal. One option is to go above it. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start within the start set.
    (9.0, 5.98),     # Pass through the breakpoint.
    (9.0, 16.0),    # Move upwards to a point above Obstacle 2. 
    (12.0, 16.0),   # Move rightwards, staying above Obstacle 2.
    (12.0, 18.0),   # Move downwards towards the goal set.
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End within the goal set.
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Start:**  Begin at (1.0, 1.0) within the start set.
2. **Breakpoint:** Reach the breakpoint (9.0, 5.98).
3. **Above Obstacle:**  Move vertically upwards to (9.0, 16.0), ensuring a safe distance above Obstacle 2.
4. **Clear Path:**  Move horizontally to the right to (12.0, 16.0), remaining clear of Obstacle 2.
5. **Approach Goal:** Move downwards to (12.0, 18.0), aligning with the goal set.
6. **Goal:** Finally, move to (19.0, 19.0) within the goal set.
