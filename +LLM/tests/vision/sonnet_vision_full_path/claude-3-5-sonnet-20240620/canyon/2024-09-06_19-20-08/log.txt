# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/06/2024 07:20:11 PM] Based on the provided information, here is a possible path that starts within the start set, ends within the goal set, and avoids the obstacles:

new_path = [
    (-0.25, 1.12), # Start point within the start set
    (0.87, 1.50), # Move up and right to avoid Obstacle 1
    (3.15, 2.43), # Continue moving up and right to reach the gap between the obstacles
    (3.86, 2.87) # Move up and right to end within the goal set
]

This path follows a diagonal trajectory that takes advantage of the gap between the two obstacles. It starts at a point within the start set, moves up and to the right to avoid Obstacle 1, then continues upwards and rightwards to pass through the gap between the obstacles, and finally reaches a point within the goal set. Throughout the path, care has been taken to keep a safe distance from the obstacles and avoid intersecting them.

[09/06/2024 07:20:14 PM] To generate a valid path that starts within the start set, avoids the obstacles, and ends in the goal set, I will:

1. Start at a point within the start set quadrilateral.
2. Move the path upward and to the right, avoiding the first obstacle.
3. Carefully navigate through the gap between the two obstacles.
4. Adjust the path downward to land within the goal set quadrilateral.

New path:
new_path = [
    (0.25, 1.12), # Start within the start set
    (1.0, 1.5),   # Move up and right to avoid Obstacle 1
    (2.9, 2.25),  # Navigate through the gap between Obstacle 1 and 2
    (3.6, 2.87)   # Move down to end within the goal set
]

The key changes from the previous path are:
- Starting at a point (0.25, 1.12) that is within the start set quadrilateral.
- Adjusting the second waypoint to (1.0, 1.5) to avoid intersecting Obstacle 1.
- Adding an intermediate waypoint at (2.9, 2.25) to carefully pass through the gap between the two obstacles.
- Adjusting the final waypoint to (3.6, 2.87) to land within the goal set quadrilateral.

This new path successfully starts within the start set, avoids the obstacles, and ends within the goal set, meeting all the requirements.
