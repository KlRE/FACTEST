# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

[09/06/2024 07:23:56 PM] Based on the provided information, here is a potential path that starts within the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids the obstacles:

new_path = [
    (-0.25, 0.87), # start point within the start set
    (0.87, 0.5),
    (2.96, 2.87), # end point within the goal set
]

This path starts at the bottom left corner of the start set, moves diagonally up and to the right, and ends at the bottom left corner of the goal set. It avoids both obstacle 1 and obstacle 2 by passing between them. The linear segments connecting the waypoints do not cross any of the obstacles.

[09/06/2024 07:24:09 PM] To generate a valid path that starts in the start set, avoids the obstacles, and ends in the goal set, I will analyze the spatial relationships between the start set, goal set, and obstacles, and iteratively construct a new path.

The initial path provided, [(âˆ’0.25, 0.87), (0.87, 0.5), (2.96, 2.87)], has two issues:
1. The first segment between (-0.25, 0.87) and (0.87, 0.5) intersects with Obstacle 2.
2. The final waypoint (2.96, 2.87) is outside the goal set.

To address these issues, I will:
1. Modify the first segment to avoid Obstacle 2.
2. Add additional waypoints to ensure the path ends within the goal set.

Starting from the first waypoint (-0.25, 0.87) in the start set, I can move the path upwards to avoid Obstacle 2. The next waypoint could be (0.87, 1.37), which is the top-right vertex of the start set. This should allow the path to clear Obstacle 2.

For the second segment, I can move the path diagonally towards the goal set. A good next waypoint would be (2.5, 2.5), which is halfway between the first waypoint and the goal set.

Finally, to ensure the path ends within the goal set, the last waypoint should be (3.5, 3.0), which is inside the goal set.

The new path would be:

new_path = [
    (-0.25, 0.87),
    (0.87, 1.37),
    (2.5, 2.5),
    (3.5, 3.0)
]

This new path starts within the start set, avoids both obstacles, and ends within the goal set, satisfying all the requirements.
