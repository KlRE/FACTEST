# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[6.0, 7.0], [5.0, 7.0], [5.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[-2.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0], [-2.0, -1.0], [0.0, -1.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[-1.0, 6.0], [1.0, 4.0], [3.0, 6.0], [1.0, 8.0]]
			Obstacle 4: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -1.0], [4.0, -1.0]]
			Obstacle 5: [[6.0, 3.0], [4.0, 3.0], [4.0, 1.0], [6.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 6: [[-2.0, 10.0], [-4.0, 10.0], [-4.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 8.0]]
			Obstacle 7: [[0.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 6.0], [0.0, 6.0]]
			Obstacle 8: [[-1.0, 0.0], [1.0, -2.0], [3.0, 0.0], [1.0, 2.0]]
			Obstacle 9: [[4.0, 8.0], [2.0, 8.0], [2.0, 6.0], [4.0, 6.0]]
			Obstacle 10: [[6.0, 10.0], [4.0, 10.0], [4.0, 8.0], [6.0, 8.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response

[09/06/2024 07:33:52 PM] Based on the provided information, here is one possible path that navigates through the obstacles and connects the start and goal sets:

new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5), # Start within the start set quadrilateral
    (-3.5, 3.5), # Move downwards to avoid Obstacle 6
    (-2.0, 3.5), # Move rightwards to avoid Obstacle 1
    (0.0, 1.5), # Move downwards to avoid Obstacle 2
    (2.0, 5.0), # Move upwards and rightwards to avoid Obstacle 3
    (4.5, 6.5)  # End within the goal set quadrilateral
]

This path starts within the start set quadrilateral, moves downwards to avoid Obstacle 6, then rightwards to avoid Obstacle 1. It then moves downwards to avoid Obstacle 2, upwards and rightwards to avoid Obstacle 3, and finally ends within the goal set quadrilateral. The path avoids all the obstacles and connects the start and goal sets as required.

[09/06/2024 07:33:56 PM] Based on the feedback provided, the key issues with the original path are:

1. Segment 5 between points (2.0, 5.0) and (4.5, 6.5) intersects with Obstacle 9.
2. The path does not end inside the goal set [[6.0, 7.0], [5.0, 7.0], [5.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0]].

To address these issues, I will modify the path to avoid the obstacle and ensure it ends within the goal set.

My thought process is as follows:

1. The segment from (2.0, 5.0) to (4.5, 6.5) intersects with Obstacle 9, so I need to find a way around it.
2. Looking at the obstacle locations, I see that I can move the path above Obstacle 9 by adding a waypoint at around (3.5, 6.5).
3. To ensure the path ends within the goal set, I will add a final waypoint at (5.5, 6.5), which is inside the goal set.

The new path is:

new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),
    (-3.5, 3.5),
    (-2.0, 3.5),
    (0.0, 1.5),
    (2.0, 5.0),
    (3.5, 6.5),
    (5.5, 6.5)
]

This new path starts in the start set, avoids all obstacles, and ends within the goal set.

[09/06/2024 07:34:00 PM] Based on the provided image and path requirements, the following revised path avoids the obstacles while starting within the start set and ending in the goal set:

new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5), # Start in the start set
    (-3.5, 3.5),
    (-2.0, 3.5),
    (0.0, 1.5),
    (2.0, 5.0),
    (3.0, 6.0), # Adjust the segment between (2.0, 5.0) and (3.5, 6.5) to avoid intersecting Obstacle 9
    (5.5, 6.5) # End in the goal set
]

Explanation:
1. The initial path provided intersected with Obstacle 9, so I adjusted the segment between (2.0, 5.0) and (3.5, 6.5) to pass through (3.0, 6.0) instead. This avoids the obstacle while still reaching the goal set.
2. The other segments of the path do not intersect any obstacles and remain the same as the original path.
3. The path now starts within the start set, ends within the goal set, and avoids all obstacles.

## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.

[09/06/2024 07:34:05 PM] Let's analyze the provided path and identify the areas where it intersects with the obstacles. Then, we can modify the path to avoid these intersections while still starting within the start set and ending in the goal set.

The problematic segments of the path are:
1. Segment 5 between points (2.0, 5.0) and (3.0, 6.0) intersects with Obstacle 9.
2. Segment 6 between points (3.0, 6.0) and (2.0, 5.0) intersects with Obstacle 9.
3. Segment 7 between points (2.0, 5.0) and (3.5, 6.5) intersects with Obstacle 9.
4. Segment 8 between points (3.5, 6.5) and (5.5, 6.5) intersects with Obstacle 9.

To avoid these intersections, we can modify the path by adding additional waypoints to guide the path around the obstacles.

New path:
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  # Start in the start set
    (-3.5, 3.5),
    (-2.0, 3.5),
    (0.0, 1.5),
    (2.0, 3.0),  # Adjust the path to go under Obstacle 9
    (3.5, 3.0),  # Continue around Obstacle 9
    (4.0, 4.5),  # Move up to avoid Obstacle 9
    (4.5, 6.5),  # Move towards the goal set
    (5.5, 6.5)   # End in the goal set
]

By adjusting the path to go under Obstacle 9 and then move up to avoid it, we can construct a valid path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and does not intersect any obstacles.

The key steps in the thought process were:
1. Identify the problematic segments that intersect with obstacles.
2. Analyze the spatial relationships between the path and the obstacles to determine how to modify the path.
3. Add additional waypoints to guide the path around the obstacles while still maintaining the start and end requirements.

The new path should now meet all the specified requirements.
