[09/06/2024 07:06:12 PM] To generate a valid path that avoids the obstacle, I will analyze the spatial relationships between the path segments and the obstacle, and make adjustments to the path accordingly.

Based on the feedback, the initial path intersects with the obstacle in multiple segments. To avoid this, I will modify the path to go around the obstacle.

The obstacle is defined by the vertices [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]. Looking at the positions of the waypoints in the initial path, the first two points (1.75, 2.0) and (1.75, 5.0) are within the vertical extent of the obstacle, and the second segment (1.75, 5.0) to (6.0, 5.0) intersects the horizontal extent of the obstacle.

To avoid this, I will modify the path as follows:

1. Start the path at (2.0, 2.0), which is a valid point within the start set.
2. Move the second waypoint to (2.0, 5.0), so that the first segment goes above the vertical extent of the obstacle.
3. Move the third waypoint to (6.0, 5.0), so that the second segment goes around the horizontal extent of the obstacle.
4. Keep the last waypoint at (9.0, 9.0), as it is a valid point within the goal set.

The new path will be:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),
    (2.0, 5.0),
    (6.0, 5.0),
    (9.0, 9.0)
]

This path should now avoid intersecting with the obstacle while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set.

[09/06/2024 07:06:16 PM] Analyzing the provided path and the obstacles, I can see that the path intersects with the obstacle at multiple points, which is not allowed. To generate a valid path that avoids the obstacle, I will need to modify the path.

Here is my thought process for creating a new path:

1. The start set is in the bottom left corner, and the goal set is in the top right corner. The obstacle is a large diagonal shape in the middle.

2. To avoid the obstacle, I will need to create a path that goes around it. One potential path would be to start at the bottom left of the start set, move up to the top of the start set, then move diagonally across the top of the obstacle, and finally move down to the bottom right of the goal set.

3. Specifically, the new path would be:
   - Start at the bottom left of the start set: (2.0, 2.0)
   - Move up to the top of the start set: (2.0, 5.0)
   - Move diagonally across the top of the obstacle: (6.0, 9.0)
   - Move down to the bottom right of the goal set: (9.0, 9.0)

    (2.0, 2.0),
    (2.0, 5.0),
    (6.0, 9.0),

]

This new path avoids intersecting with the obstacle and starts within the start set and ends within the goal set, as required.

[09/06/2024 07:06:18 PM] To generate a valid path that avoids the obstacle, I will analyze the spatial relationships and make adjustments to the path:

1. The first segment from (2.0, 2.0) to (2.0, 5.0) intersects with Obstacle 1. This segment needs to be adjusted to avoid the obstacle.

2. Looking at the obstacle, I can see that there is a gap on the right side of the obstacle, between the coordinates (5.0, 5.0) and (9.0, 5.0). By adjusting the path to go through this gap, I can avoid the obstacle.

3. The adjusted path will be:
   new_path = [
       (2.0, 2.0), # start in the start set
       (2.0, 5.0), # move upwards to get to the level of the gap
       (6.0, 5.0), # move rightwards to reach the gap
       (9.0, 9.0)  # move upwards to end in the goal set
   ]

This new path avoids intersecting with the obstacle by going through the gap on the right side. The path starts in the start set, moves upwards to the gap level, then rightwards through the gap, and finally upwards to end in the goal set.

[09/06/2024 07:06:22 PM] Understood. Let's analyze the provided path and obstacles to generate a new path that avoids the obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set.

The initial path provided has three segments:
1. (2.0, 2.0) to (2.0, 5.0)
2. (2.0, 5.0) to (6.0, 5.0) 
3. (6.0, 5.0) to (9.0, 9.0)

Upon inspection, we can see that all three segments intersect with the obstacle, defined by the coordinates [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]. This means the current path is not valid as it crosses through the obstacle.

To avoid the obstacle, we can modify the path by adding additional waypoints to create a path that goes around the obstacle. Here's a new path that should avoid the obstacle:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0), # Start in the start set
    (2.0, 4.0), # Move up to avoid the bottom of the obstacle
    (4.0, 4.0), # Move right to the left edge of the obstacle
    (4.0, 8.0), # Move up to the top edge of the obstacle
    (8.0, 8.0), # Move right to the right edge of the obstacle
    (8.0, 9.0)  # Move up to end in the goal set
]

This new path starts at (2.0, 2.0) within the start set, then moves up to (2.0, 4.0) to avoid the bottom of the obstacle. It then moves right to (4.0, 4.0), up to (4.0, 8.0), right to (8.0, 8.0), and finally up to (8.0, 9.0) to end within the goal set. By adding these additional waypoints, the path is able to navigate around the obstacle without intersecting it.

Please let me know if this new path looks good or if you have any other feedback.

[09/06/2024 07:06:30 PM] Analyzing the provided path and the obstacles, I can see that the path intersects with several obstacles, making it infeasible. To generate a valid path that avoids the obstacles and ends within the goal set, I will adjust the path as follows:

1. The first segment from (2.0, 2.0) to (2.0, 4.0) intersects with Obstacle 1. To avoid this, I will add an intermediate waypoint at (2.0, 5.0) to go above the obstacle.

2. The second segment from (2.0, 4.0) to (4.0, 4.0) also intersects with Obstacle 1. To avoid this, I will add an intermediate waypoint at (3.0, 4.0) to move around the obstacle.

3. The third segment from (4.0, 4.0) to (4.0, 8.0) intersects with Obstacle 1. To avoid this, I will add an intermediate waypoint at (4.0, 6.0) to go above the obstacle.

4. The fourth segment from (4.0, 8.0) to (8.0, 8.0) intersects with Obstacle 1. To avoid this, I will add an intermediate waypoint at (6.0, 8.0) to move around the obstacle.

5. The final segment from (8.0, 8.0) to (8.0, 9.0) does not intersect with any obstacles, but it does not end within the goal set. To ensure the path ends within the goal set, I will add a final waypoint at (9.0, 9.0).

The new, adjusted path is:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),
    (2.0, 5.0),
    (3.0, 4.0),
    (4.0, 6.0),

[09/06/2024 07:06:33 PM] Based on the provided image and the identified issues with the original path, here is my proposed new path that avoids intersecting the obstacle:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0), # Start in the start set
    (2.0, 5.0), # Move up to avoid the obstacle
    (5.5, 7.0), # Move diagonally up and right to go around the obstacle
    (7.0, 8.0), # Continue moving up and right
    (9.0, 9.0) # End in the goal set
]

My thought process:

1. The original path had several segments that intersected with the obstacle, so I needed to find a way to go around the obstacle entirely.
2. I decided to first move the path upwards from the starting point to get above the obstacle, then diagonally up and to the right to go around the obstacle.
3. By moving the waypoints in this way, I was able to create a path that avoids intersecting with the obstacle while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set.
4. I added additional waypoints between the original waypoints to create a smoother, more gradual path around the obstacle.

This new path should successfully navigate around the obstacle without crossing any of its edges. Let me know if you have any other feedback or if you would like me to modify the path further.

[09/06/2024 07:06:37 PM] HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[09/06/2024 07:06:37 PM] To avoid the obstacles, I have adjusted the path as follows:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),  # Start in the start set
    (2.0, 6.0),  # Move upwards to get above the obstacles
    (7.0, 8.0),  # Move diagonally to reach the goal set
    (9.0, 9.0)   # End in the goal set
]

Explanation:
- The initial segment from (2.0, 2.0) to (2.0, 5.0) intersects with Obstacle 1, so I moved the second waypoint up to (2.0, 6.0) to go over the obstacle.
- The segment from (2.0, 6.0) to (5.5, 7.0) also intersects with Obstacle 1, so I adjusted the path to go diagonally from (2.0, 6.0) to (7.0, 8.0), which avoids the obstacle.
- The final segment from (7.0, 8.0) to (9.0, 9.0) is clear and ends within the goal set.

By adjusting the path to go over and around the obstacle, I was able to find a valid path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and completely avoids all obstacles.

[09/06/2024 07:06:40 PM] Let's analyze the provided path and see how we can modify it to avoid the obstacles:

The initial path provided is:
path = [(2.0, 2.0), (2.0, 6.0), (7.0, 8.0), (9.0, 9.0)]

Upon examining the path, we can see that the first two segments intersect with Obstacle 1, defined by the coordinates [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]. Specifically:

- The segment between (2.0, 2.0) and (2.0, 6.0) passes through the obstacle.
- The segment between (2.0, 6.0) and (7.0, 8.0) also passes through the obstacle.

To avoid these obstacles, we need to modify the path by adding additional waypoints that allow us to navigate around the obstacle. Here's a revised path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0), # Start in the start set
    (2.0, 5.0), # Move up to avoid the obstacle
    (6.0, 7.0), # Move diagonally to avoid the obstacle
    (9.0, 9.0)  # End in the goal set
]

The key changes are:
1. The first waypoint remains the same at (2.0, 2.0), as it's within the start set.
2. The second waypoint at (2.0, 5.0) moves the path up, avoiding the lower part of the obstacle.
3. The third waypoint at (6.0, 7.0) moves the path diagonally, continuing to avoid the obstacle.
4. The final waypoint at (9.0, 9.0) ends the path inside the goal set.

By modifying the path in this way, we can ensure that the path avoids the obstacle and connects the start and goal sets without intersecting any obstacles.

[09/06/2024 07:06:43 PM] Based on the provided information and the analysis of the path segments, it appears that the initial path you provided intersects with the obstacle. To avoid this issue, I would suggest the following revised path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),  # Start in the start set
    (2.0, 6.0),  # Move upwards to clear the obstacle
    (7.0, 8.0),  # Move diagonally to avoid the obstacle
    (9.0, 9.0)   # End in the goal set
]

Explanation:

1. The path starts at (2.0, 2.0), which is within the start set.
2. The first segment from (2.0, 2.0) to (2.0, 6.0) avoids the obstacle by moving upwards.
3. The second segment from (2.0, 6.0) to (7.0, 8.0) takes a diagonal path to clear the obstacle and reach the upper right corner.
4. The final segment from (7.0, 8.0) to (9.0, 9.0) leads the path directly into the goal set.

By adjusting the path to include an upward move and a diagonal segment, the new path successfully avoids intersecting with the obstacle while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]

    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

[09/06/2024 07:06:47 PM] HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[09/06/2024 07:06:47 PM] After analyzing the provided path and the obstacles, I can see that the original path intersects with Obstacle 1 at multiple points, making it an invalid solution. To avoid the obstacles and reach the goal set, I propose the following revised path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0), # Start in the start set
    (2.0, 6.0), # Move up to get above Obstacle 1
    (6.0, 8.0), # Move diagonally to avoid the obstacle
    (9.0, 9.0)  # End in the goal set
]

The reasoning behind this revised path is as follows:

1. The path starts at (2.0, 2.0), which is a valid starting point within the start set.
2. The first segment from (2.0, 2.0) to (2.0, 6.0) moves the path up and above Obstacle 1, avoiding any intersection.
3. The second segment from (2.0, 6.0) to (6.0, 8.0) takes a diagonal path to the right, once again avoiding Obstacle 1.
4. The final segment from (6.0, 8.0) to (9.0, 9.0) reaches the goal set without intersecting any obstacles.

By adjusting the waypoints and the path segments, I was able to create a valid path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and successfully avoids the obstacle. The new path maintains a safe distance from the obstacle and follows a smooth, non-crossing trajectory.

[09/06/2024 07:06:50 PM] Here is my analysis and a revised path that avoids the obstacles:

The provided path intersects with the obstacle multiple times, so it needs to be adjusted to avoid the obstacle completely. After analyzing the spatial relationships, I see that there is a clear path around the obstacle if we add an additional waypoint.

The key observations are:
1. The start set and the goal set are on opposite sides of the obstacle, so the path needs to go around the obstacle.
2. There is a gap between the top-left and bottom-right corners of the obstacle that provides a clear path to go around it.

Based on this, I propose the following revised path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0), # Start in the start set
    (2.0, 6.0), # Move up to approach the gap above the obstacle
    (8.0, 6.0), # Move horizontally through the gap 
    (9.0, 9.0)  # End in the goal set
]

This path avoids intersecting with the obstacle by:
1. Starting in the start set
2. Moving up to approach the gap above the obstacle
3. Moving horizontally through the gap
4. Ending in the goal set

The key change is adding the waypoint at (8.0, 6.0) to guide the path through the clear gap between the top-left and bottom-right corners of the obstacle. This ensures the path completely avoids the obstacle while connecting the start and goal sets.

[09/06/2024 07:06:54 PM] Based on the provided feedback, the original path you generated intersects with the obstacle, which is not allowed. Let's analyze the situation and come up with a new path that avoids the obstacle.

The key issues with the original path are:
1. The segment between (2.0, 2.0) and (2.0, 6.0) intersects with Obstacle 1.
2. The segment between (2.0, 6.0) and (8.0, 6.0) also intersects with Obstacle 1.
3. The segment between (8.0, 6.0) and (9.0, 9.0) intersects with Obstacle 1 as well.

To avoid these intersections, we need to modify the path to go around the obstacle. Here's the thought process:

1. The start set is in the bottom-left corner, and the goal set is in the top-right corner. The obstacle is in the middle, blocking the direct path.
2. To avoid the obstacle, we can first move up to the top edge of the obstacle, then move across to the right side of the obstacle, and finally move up to the goal set.
3. This can be accomplished by adding an additional waypoint on the top edge of the obstacle, and another waypoint on the right side of the obstacle.

The new path would be:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),   # Start in the start set
    (2.0, 5.0),   # Move up to the top edge of the obstacle
    (5.0, 5.0),   # Move across the top of the obstacle
    (8.0, 8.0)    # Move up to the goal set
]

This new path avoids all intersections with the obstacle and starts within the start set and ends within the goal set.

[09/06/2024 07:06:57 PM] Based on the feedback and the provided instructions, here is my thought process and the corrected path:

The initial path intersected with the obstacle at multiple segments, which is not allowed. To avoid this, I will need to add additional waypoints to navigate around the obstacle.

Looking at the obstacle, I can see that there is a gap between the top and bottom of the obstacle, specifically between the y-coordinates of 5.0 and 8.0. I can use this gap to plan a path that avoids the obstacle.

The new path will start at a point within the start set, then move up to the gap, traverse through the gap, and then move down to end within the goal set.

The new path would be:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),  # Start within the start set
    (2.0, 5.0),  # Move up to the gap
    (5.0, 5.0),  # Move through the gap
    (9.0, 9.0)   # Move down to end within the goal set
]

This path starts within the start set, moves through the gap in the obstacle, and ends within the goal set, while avoiding any intersection with the obstacle.

[09/06/2024 07:07:00 PM] Understood. Let me analyze the provided path and obstacles, and suggest a revised path that avoids intersecting the obstacles.

The initial path provided has three segments that intersect with the obstacle:
- Segment 1 between (2.0, 2.0) and (2.0, 5.0) intersects with Obstacle 1.
- Segment 2 between (2.0, 5.0) and (5.0, 5.0) also intersects with Obstacle 1.
- Segment 3 between (5.0, 5.0) and (9.0, 9.0) intersects with Obstacle 1 again.

To avoid these intersections, we need to modify the path to go around the obstacle. One possible solution is:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0), # Start in the start set
    (2.0, 4.0), # Move up to avoid the first part of the obstacle
    (4.0, 4.0), # Move right to get around the obstacle
    (4.0, 8.0), # Move up to approach the goal set
    (9.0, 9.0) # End in the goal set
]

This new path avoids intersecting with the obstacle by going around it. The key changes are:
1. Changing the second waypoint to (2.0, 4.0) to move up and avoid the lower part of the obstacle.
2. Changing the third waypoint to (4.0, 4.0) to move right and get around the obstacle.
3. Changing the fourth waypoint to (4.0, 8.0) to move up towards the goal set while still avoiding the obstacle.

This revised path should successfully navigate through the environment while avoiding the obstacle.

[09/06/2024 07:07:04 PM] Analyzing the provided path and obstacles, it appears that the current path intersects with the obstacle at multiple segments. To avoid the obstacle and find a valid path, I will adjust the waypoints to create a new path that navigates around the obstacle.

The key steps in my thought process are:

1. Identify the problematic segments of the path that intersect with the obstacle.
2. Determine how to modify the waypoints to create a path that avoids the obstacle.
3. Ensure the new path starts within the start set and ends within the goal set.

Looking at the provided path, the first, second, third, and fourth segments all intersect with the obstacle. To avoid this, I will add additional waypoints to create a path that goes around the obstacle.

The new path will be:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),  # Start in the start set
    (2.0, 5.0),  # Move up to clear the obstacle
    (6.0, 5.0),  # Move right to go around the obstacle
    (6.0, 9.0),  # Move up to reach the goal set
    (9.0, 9.0)   # End in the goal set
]

This new path avoids intersecting with the obstacle by going up and around it. The additional waypoints at (2.0, 5.0) and (6.0, 5.0) create a path that navigates the obstacle without crossing it.

The new path starts within the start set, ends within the goal set, and does not intersect any obstacles, meeting the specified requirements.

[09/06/2024 07:07:07 PM] Based on the provided feedback, the original path has segments that intersect with the obstacle, which is not allowed. To avoid the obstacles and create a valid path, I will adjust the waypoints and analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles.

The first segment from (2.0, 2.0) to (2.0, 5.0) intersects with Obstacle 1. To avoid this, I can move the second waypoint up to (2.0, 6.0) to go over the obstacle.

The second segment from (2.0, 6.0) to (6.0, 5.0) also intersects with Obstacle 1. To avoid this, I can move the third waypoint to the right to (7.0, 6.0), which is just outside the obstacle.

The third segment from (7.0, 6.0) to (6.0, 9.0) no longer intersects with the obstacle, as it goes above it.

The final segment from (7.0, 6.0) to (9.0, 9.0) is within the goal set and does not intersect any obstacles.

Therefore, the new, corrected path is:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),
    (2.0, 6.0),
    (7.0, 6.0),
    (9.0, 9.0)
]

This path starts within the start set, ends within the goal set, and avoids intersecting any obstacles.

[09/06/2024 07:07:09 PM] Here is my analysis and the corrected path:

The initial path provided intersects with the obstacle at multiple points, so it needs to be adjusted to avoid the obstacle completely. 

After analyzing the spatial relationships, I see that the obstacle is a large quadrilateral that spans the middle of the environment. The start set is in the bottom left quadrant, and the goal set is in the top right quadrant. 

To avoid the obstacle, the path should first move upwards from the start set to get above the obstacle, then move diagonally across the top right quadrant to reach the goal set. This will ensure the path avoids intersecting the obstacle at any point.

The new path I propose is:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0), # start in the start set
    (2.0, 6.0), # move upwards to get above the obstacle 
    (7.0, 6.0), # move diagonally across the top right quadrant
    (9.0, 9.0) # end in the goal set
]

This new path starts in the start set, moves up above the obstacle, then diagonally across the top right quadrant to reach the goal set, avoiding intersection with the obstacle at all points. The waypoints have been carefully chosen to ensure the path segments do not cross the obstacle boundaries.

[09/06/2024 07:07:13 PM] Let's work through this step-by-step:

1. The provided path has three segments that intersect with the obstacle:
    - Segment 1 between (2.0, 2.0) and (2.0, 6.0) intersects with Obstacle 1.
    - Segment 2 between (2.0, 6.0) and (7.0, 6.0) also intersects with Obstacle 1.
    - Segment 3 between (7.0, 6.0) and (9.0, 9.0) intersects with Obstacle 1 as well.

2. To avoid the obstacle, we need to modify the path to go around it. Since the obstacle is a quadrilateral, we can find a path that passes around its edges.

3. One possible solution is to add an additional waypoint at (5.0, 6.0) that allows the path to go around the right side of the obstacle. This would result in the following new path:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),
    (2.0, 6.0), 
    (5.0, 6.0),
    (9.0, 9.0)
]

This new path avoids intersecting with the obstacle while still starting within the start set and ending within the goal set.

The key steps were:
1. Identify the intersecting segments of the original path.
2. Analyze the shape and position of the obstacle to find a way to go around it.
3. Add an additional waypoint that allows the path to navigate around the obstacle.

By making this adjustment, the new path is able to satisfy the requirements of starting in the start set, ending in the goal set, and avoiding all obstacles.

[09/06/2024 07:07:16 PM] To create a valid path that avoids the obstacle, I will analyze the spatial relationships and adjust the waypoints accordingly.

The first segment between (2.0, 2.0) and (2.0, 6.0) intersects with the obstacle. To avoid this, I will modify the path to go around the obstacle:

1. Start at (2.0, 2.0) within the start set.
2. Move to (2.0, 5.0) to get above the obstacle.
3. Move to (5.0, 5.0) to go around the right side of the obstacle.
4. Move to (8.0, 8.0) to reach the goal set.

The new path would be:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),
    (2.0, 5.0),
    (5.0, 5.0),
    (8.0, 8.0)
]

This new path avoids intersecting with the obstacle and starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

[09/06/2024 07:07:20 PM] Understood. Let's think through how to modify the path to avoid the obstacles and end within the goal set.

Based on the provided feedback, the path has segments that intersect with the obstacle. Specifically:
- Segment 1 between (2.0, 2.0) and (2.0, 5.0) intersects with Obstacle 1.
- Segment 2 between (2.0, 5.0) and (5.0, 5.0) also intersects with Obstacle 1. 
- Segment 3 between (5.0, 5.0) and (8.0, 8.0) intersects with Obstacle 1 as well.

To avoid these obstacles, we need to modify the path by adding additional waypoints that allow the path to navigate around the obstacle. 

A potential new path could be:
1. Start at (2.0, 2.0) within the start set.
2. Move up to (2.0, 4.0) to avoid the lower part of Obstacle 1.
3. Move right to (4.0, 4.0) to pass through the gap between the obstacle and the goal set.
4. Move up to (7.0, 7.0) to reach the goal set.
5. End at a point within the goal set, for example (9.0, 9.0).

This path avoids intersecting with Obstacle 1 and ends within the goal set. Let's represent the new path as follows:

new_path = [
    (2.0, 2.0),
    (2.0, 4.0),
    (4.0, 4.0), 
    (7.0, 7.0),
    (9.0, 9.0)
]

By adding the additional waypoints, we can navigate around the obstacle and reach the goal set, satisfying all the requirements.
