# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]

[09/06/2024 07:59:02 PM] To address the issues with the provided path, I will analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and adjust the path accordingly to ensure it starts within the start set, avoids the obstacles, and ends within the goal set.

The first segment of the path, from (0.5, 0.5) to (0.5, 3.0), intersects with Obstacle 2. To avoid this obstacle, I will adjust the path to move upwards first, then shift sideways to reach the goal set.

The revised path will be as follows:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 3.5),  # Move upwards to get above Obstacle 2
    (2.5, 3.5),  # Move horizontally to the right to reach the gap between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)   # Move downwards to end within the goal set
]

This revised path avoids all the obstacles and starts within the start set and ends within the goal set. The key changes are:

1. Moved the second waypoint higher to (0.5, 3.5) to get above Obstacle 2.
2. Shifted the third waypoint to (2.5, 3.5) to move through the gap between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2.
3. Kept the final waypoint at (4.5, 4.5) to end within the goal set.

By adjusting the path to avoid the obstacles and reach the goal set, I have addressed the issues with the previous path.

The key steps I will take are:

1. Start the path within the start set, ensuring the first waypoint is inside the blue quadrilateral.
2. Avoid the obstacles by adding additional waypoints to navigate around them.
3. Ensure the final waypoint is within the green goal set quadrilateral.

Proposed new path:

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]

[09/06/2024 07:59:08 PM] To avoid the obstacles and generate a valid path, I will revise the waypoints as follows:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 2.5), # Move up to clear Obstacle 2
    (1.5, 2.5), # Move right to clear Obstacle 2
    (1.5, 4.0), # Move up to approach the gap between Obstacles 1 and 2
    (4.0, 4.0), # Move right to pass through the gap
    (4.5, 4.5)  # End within the goal set
]

Explanation:
1. The initial waypoint at (0.5, 0.5) is within the start set.
2. The second waypoint at (0.5, 2.5) moves the path up and to the right, avoiding the bottom of Obstacle 2.
3. The third waypoint at (1.5, 2.5) continues moving the path to the right, clearing Obstacle 2.
4. The fourth waypoint at (1.5, 4.0) moves the path up, positioning it to approach the gap between Obstacles 1 and 2.
5. The fifth waypoint at (4.0, 4.0) moves the path through the gap between the obstacles.
6. The final waypoint at (4.5, 4.5) is within the goal set.

This revised path avoids all the obstacles and connects the start and goal sets without intersecting any of the obstacles.

[09/06/2024 07:59:12 PM] Analyzing the provided path and the environment, there are several segments that intersect with the obstacles, preventing the path from being valid. Let me walk through the issues and propose a revised path that avoids the obstacles:

1. Segment 1 between (0.5, 0.5) and (0.5, 2.5) intersects with Obstacle 2. This segment needs to be adjusted to avoid the obstacle.

2. Segment 2 between (0.5, 2.5) and (1.5, 2.5) also intersects with Obstacle 2. This segment needs to be modified.

3. Segment 3 between (1.5, 2.5) and (1.5, 4.0) intersects with Obstacle 2. This segment needs to be adjusted as well.

4. Segment 4 between (1.5, 4.0) and (4.0, 4.0) intersects with Obstacle 2. This segment requires a change to avoid the obstacle.

To address these issues, I propose the following revised path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # Start in the start set
    (0.5, 2.0), # Move up to avoid Obstacle 2
    (1.0, 2.0), # Move right to avoid Obstacle 2
    (1.0, 3.0), # Move up to avoid Obstacle 2
    (3.0, 3.0), # Move right to avoid Obstacle 2
    (3.0, 4.0), # Move up to reach the goal set
    (4.5, 4.5) # End in the goal set
]

This revised path avoids all the obstacles by adjusting the waypoints and the connecting segments. The key changes are:

1. Raising the y-coordinate of the second waypoint to 2.0 to clear Obstacle 2.
2. Moving the third waypoint to (1.0, 2.0) to create a straight line segment that avoids Obstacle 2.
3. Raising the y-coordinate of the fourth waypoint to 3.0 to continue avoiding Obstacle 2.
4. Moving the fifth waypoint to (3.0, 3.0) to create a straight line segment that avoids Obstacle 2.
5. Raising the y-coordinate of the sixth waypoint to 4.0 to reach the goal set.

With these changes, the new path successfully avoids all the obstacles and connects the start set to the goal set.

[09/06/2024 07:59:17 PM] Analyzing the path and the obstacles, I see that there are several segments of the provided path that intersect with the obstacles, making the path invalid. To create a valid path that avoids the obstacles, I will need to modify the waypoints.

The key steps I will take are:

1. Identify the problematic segments of the path that intersect with the obstacles.
2. Adjust the waypoints to create a new path that avoids the obstacles while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set.

Problematic Segments:
- Segment 1 between (0.5, 0.5) and (0.5, 2.0) intersects with Obstacle 2.
- Segment 2 between (0.5, 2.0) and (1.0, 2.0) intersects with Obstacle 2.
- Segment 3 between (1.0, 2.0) and (1.0, 3.0) intersects with Obstacle 2.
- Segment 4 between (1.0, 3.0) and (3.0, 3.0) intersects with Obstacle 2.
- Segment 5 between (3.0, 3.0) and (3.0, 4.0) intersects with Obstacle 2.
- Segment 6 between (3.0, 4.0) and (4.5, 4.5) intersects with Obstacle 2.

To avoid these obstacles, I will modify the path as follows:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start in the start set
    (0.5, 3.0),  # Move up to get above Obstacle 2
    (2.5, 3.0),  # Move right to reach the gap between Obstacle 2 and the goal set
    (4.5, 4.5)   # End in the goal set
]

This new path avoids all the obstacles by:
1. Starting in the start set.
2. Moving up to get above Obstacle 2.
3. Moving right to reach the gap between Obstacle 2 and the goal set.
4. Ending in the goal set.

The key changes are adding waypoints at (0.5, 3.0) and (2.5, 3.0) to navigate around Obstacle 2 and reach the gap.

Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]

[09/06/2024 07:59:20 PM] To avoid the obstacles, I would suggest the following modified path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # Start in the start set
    (0.5, 2.0), # Move upwards to avoid Obstacle 2
    (3.0, 2.0), # Move horizontally to reach the gap between Obstacles 1 and 2
    (4.0, 4.0), # Move upwards to the goal set
    (4.5, 4.5) # End in the goal set
]

The key changes are:

1. The first waypoint (0.5, 0.5) remains the same, starting within the start set.
2. The second waypoint (0.5, 2.0) moves the path upwards to avoid the lower portion of Obstacle 2.
3. The third waypoint (3.0, 2.0) moves the path horizontally to reach the gap between Obstacles 1 and 2.
4. The fourth waypoint (4.0, 4.0) moves the path upwards to reach the goal set.
5. The final waypoint (4.5, 4.5) ends the path within the goal set.

By adjusting the waypoints, the path now avoids intersecting with any of the obstacles and connects the start and goal sets as required. The path takes a slightly longer route to navigate around the obstacles, but it successfully avoids them and reaches the desired goal.

[09/06/2024 07:59:23 PM] To avoid intersecting with the obstacles, I would modify the path as follows:

new_path = [
    (0.75, 0.75), # Start within the start set, slightly offset from the corners
    (0.75, 2.0), # Move up to avoid the first obstacle
    (2.0, 2.0), # Move right to approach the gap between obstacles
    (4.0, 4.0), # Move diagonally up and right to pass through the gap
    (4.75, 4.75) # End within the goal set, slightly offset from the corners
]

Explanation:
1. The initial segment from (0.75, 0.75) to (0.75, 2.0) avoids the first obstacle by moving straight up.
2. The segment from (0.75, 2.0) to (2.0, 2.0) moves horizontally to approach the gap between the two obstacles.
3. The diagonal segment from (2.0, 2.0) to (4.0, 4.0) allows the path to pass through the gap between the two obstacles.
4. The final segment from (4.0, 4.0) to (4.75, 4.75) ends the path within the goal set, slightly offset from the corners.

By adjusting the waypoints and avoiding direct intersections with the obstacles, this path successfully navigates through the environment while satisfying the requirements.

[09/06/2024 07:59:26 PM] Based on the provided information and the image, the original path has some segments that intersect with the obstacles, which is not allowed. To avoid the obstacles and find a valid path, I will analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and adjust the path accordingly.

Looking at the image, there is a clear gap between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2 that can be used to navigate around the obstacles. The path can be adjusted to take advantage of this gap.

The new path I propose is:

new_path = [
    (0.75, 0.75), # Start in the start set
    (0.75, 2.5), # Move up to get above Obstacle 2
    (3.5, 2.5), # Move right to reach the gap between the obstacles
    (4.5, 4.5) # Move down to end in the goal set
]

Explanation:
1. The path starts at (0.75, 0.75), which is within the start set.
2. The path moves up to (0.75, 2.5) to get above Obstacle 2 and avoid intersecting with it.
3. The path then moves right to (3.5, 2.5), which is in the gap between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2, allowing it to navigate around the obstacles.
4. Finally, the path moves down to (4.5, 4.5), which is within the goal set.

This new path avoids all the obstacles and connects the start set to the goal set without any intersections.

[09/06/2024 07:59:29 PM] Based on the provided feedback, it seems that the initial path you proposed intersects with the obstacles. To avoid the obstacles and find a valid path, let's analyze the environment and adjust the waypoints accordingly.

The main issue with the initial path is that the first two segments intersect with Obstacle 2. To avoid this, we need to modify the path to go around the obstacle.

Here's my thought process and the corrected path:

1. The start set is in the bottom-left corner, and the goal set is in the top-right corner.
2. Obstacle 1 is located in the middle, and Obstacle 2 is in the top-left area.
3. To avoid both obstacles, we can plan a path that starts in the bottom-left corner of the start set, moves up along the left side of Obstacle 1, then turns right to pass between the two obstacles, and finally moves diagonally to the top-right corner of the goal set.

new_path = [
    (0.75, 0.75),  # Start in the bottom-left corner of the start set
    (0.75, 3.0),   # Move up along the left side of Obstacle 1
    (3.0, 3.0),    # Move right to pass between the two obstacles
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Move diagonally to the top-right corner of the goal set
]

This new path avoids both obstacles and starts within the start set and ends within the goal set. The path segments do not intersect with any of the obstacles, and the path is constructed by connecting the waypoints linearly.

## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]

        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

[09/06/2024 07:59:32 PM] Analyzing the provided path and obstacles, I can see that the current path intersects with Obstacle 2 in multiple segments. To avoid these obstacles, I will modify the path to go around them.

Here is the revised path:

new_path = [
    (0.75, 0.75), # Start in the start set 
    (0.75, 2.0), # Move up to avoid Obstacle 2
    (2.0, 2.0), # Move right to reach the gap between Obstacle 1 and 2
    (2.0, 4.0), # Move up to reach the goal set
    (4.5, 4.5) # End in the goal set
]

This new path avoids intersecting any of the obstacles by:

1. Starting at (0.75, 0.75) within the start set.
2. Moving vertically to (0.75, 2.0) to go over the lower part of Obstacle 2.
3. Moving horizontally to (2.0, 2.0) to reach the gap between Obstacle 1 and 2.
4. Moving vertically to (2.0, 4.0) to reach the upper part of the goal set.
5. Moving diagonally to (4.5, 4.5) to end within the goal set.

By adjusting the waypoints, the path now successfully avoids all obstacles and connects the start and goal sets without any intersections.

To avoid the obstacles while keeping the path as direct as possible, I propose the following revised path:

    (1.0, 2.0), # move upwards to clear Obstacle 1

    (2.5, 4.0), # move upwards to reach the goal set
    (4.5, 4.5) # end in the goal set
]

The key changes I made are:

1. Starting at (1.0, 1.0) within the start set.
2. Moving the path upwards to (1.0, 2.0) to clear the first obstacle.
3. Shifting the path rightwards to (2.5, 2.0) to bypass the second obstacle.
4. Moving the path upwards to (2.5, 4.0) to reach the goal set.
5. Ending the path at (4.5, 4.5) within the goal set.

This revised path avoids intersecting with any of the obstacles and satisfies the non-crossing requirement. It also starts within the start set and ends within the goal set, meeting all the path requirements.

[09/06/2024 07:59:40 PM] Analyzing the provided path and obstacle information, I can see that the initial path you proposed intersects with several obstacles, making it an invalid solution. Let me walk through the path step-by-step and suggest changes to avoid the obstacles while maintaining the start and end constraints:

1. The first segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (1.0, 2.0) intersects with Obstacle 2. To avoid this, we can adjust the path to go up and over the obstacle.

2. The second segment from (1.0, 2.0) to (2.5, 2.0) also intersects with Obstacle 2. We need to find a way to go around the right side of the obstacle.

3. The third segment from (2.5, 2.0) to (2.5, 4.0) intersects with Obstacle 2 again. We need to continue going around the right side of the obstacle.

4. The fourth segment from (2.5, 4.0) to (4.5, 4.5) intersects with Obstacle 2 one more time. We need to find a path that avoids the right side of the obstacle and reaches the goal set.

Taking these observations into account, I propose the following revised path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), # Start in the start set
    (1.0, 2.5), # Go up to avoid Obstacle 2
    (2.0, 2.5), # Move to the right to get around Obstacle 2
    (2.0, 4.0), # Move up to reach the top of Obstacle 2
    (4.0, 4.0), # Move to the right to reach the goal set
    (4.5, 4.5)  # End in the goal set
]

This revised path avoids intersecting with any of the obstacles while starting within the start set and ending within the goal set. The key changes are:

1. Adding an additional waypoint at (1.0, 2.5) to go up and over the first part of Obstacle 2.
2. Moving the next waypoint to (2.0, 2.5) to go around the right side of Obstacle 2.
3. Adding a waypoint at (2.0, 4.0) to reach the top of Obstacle 2.
4. Finally, moving the last waypoint to (4.0, 4.0) to reach the goal set without intersecting Obstacle 2.

By carefully analyzing the spatial relationships between the obstacles and the start/goal sets, I was able to construct a valid path that satisfies all the requirements. Please let me know if you have any further questions or feedback.

[09/06/2024 07:59:43 PM] Analyzing the provided path and the obstacles, I can see that the current path intersects with several of the obstacles, which is not allowed. Let me propose a revised path that avoids the obstacles while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set.

The key issues with the current path are:
1. The segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (1.0, 2.5) intersects with Obstacle 2.
2. The segment from (1.0, 2.5) to (2.0, 2.5) also intersects with Obstacle 2.
3. The segment from (2.0, 2.5) to (2.0, 4.0) intersects with Obstacle 2.
4. The segment from (2.0, 4.0) to (4.0, 4.0) intersects with Obstacle 2.

To avoid these obstacles, I will modify the path as follows:

1. Start at (1.0, 1.0) in the start set.
2. Move upwards to (1.0, 2.0) to clear Obstacle 2 from the bottom.
3. Move diagonally to (2.5, 3.5) to avoid the top of Obstacle 2.
4. Move horizontally to (4.5, 3.5) to reach the goal set.
5. Move diagonally to (5.0, 4.0) to end in the goal set.

The new proposed path is:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (1.0, 2.0),
    (2.5, 3.5),
    (4.5, 3.5),
    (5.0, 4.0)
]

This new path successfully navigates around the obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set.

[09/06/2024 07:59:47 PM] Alright, let's analyze the provided path and identify the issues with obstacle avoidance. The path starts correctly within the start set, but there are some problematic segments that intersect with the obstacles.

The first segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (1.0, 2.0) intersects with Obstacle 2, which is not acceptable. We need to find a way to avoid this obstacle.

The second segment from (1.0, 2.0) to (2.5, 3.5) also intersects with Obstacle 2, so we need to adjust this part of the path as well.

The third segment from (2.5, 3.5) to (4.5, 3.5) intersects with Obstacle 2 again, which is another issue we need to address.

To avoid these obstacles, we can modify the path by adding additional waypoints to create a smoother trajectory that navigates around the obstacles. Let's try the following path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), # Start in the start set
    (1.0, 2.0), # Move up to avoid Obstacle 2
    (2.0, 3.0), # Move diagonally to climb above Obstacle 2
    (4.0, 3.0), # Move horizontally to reach the gap between Obstacle 2 and the goal set
    (4.5, 4.0) # Move up to end in the goal set
]

This new path avoids intersecting with any of the obstacles. The key changes are:
1. Adding a waypoint at (2.0, 3.0) to climb above Obstacle 2 after starting at (1.0, 1.0).
2. Moving horizontally from (2.0, 3.0) to (4.0, 3.0) to reach the gap between Obstacle 2 and the goal set.
3. Finally, moving up to (4.5, 4.0) to end in the goal set.

By adjusting the path in this way, we can ensure that the entire trajectory avoids the obstacles and satisfies the requirements.

[09/06/2024 07:59:50 PM] Analyzing the path provided and the obstacles, I can see that there are several segments that intersect with the obstacles, making the path invalid. To avoid the obstacles, I will reconstruct the path with additional waypoints to navigate around them.

The first segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (1.0, 2.0) intersects with Obstacle 2. To avoid this, I will add an additional waypoint at (1.0, 3.0) to go over the obstacle.

The second segment from (1.0, 2.0) to (2.0, 3.0) also intersects with Obstacle 2. To avoid this, I will add another waypoint at (3.0, 3.0) to go around the right side of the obstacle.

The third segment from (2.0, 3.0) to (4.0, 3.0) still intersects with Obstacle 2. To avoid this, I will add a final waypoint at (4.0, 4.0) to go over the top of the obstacle.

The new path that avoids all the obstacles is:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (1.0, 3.0),
    (3.0, 3.0),
    (4.0, 4.0),
    (4.5, 4.0)
]

This path starts within the start set, navigates around the obstacles, and ends within the goal set, while ensuring that no segment intersects with any of the obstacles.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]

[09/06/2024 07:59:53 PM] Analyzing the provided path and the obstacles, I see that there are several segments of the path that intersect with the obstacles, which is not allowed. Let me think through how to adjust the path to avoid these collisions while still starting within the start set and ending within the goal set.

The first segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (1.0, 3.0) intersects with Obstacle 2. To avoid this, I can modify the path to go around the obstacle. One way to do this would be to add an additional waypoint at (1.0, 2.0) that allows the path to go above Obstacle 2.

The second segment from (1.0, 3.0) to (3.0, 3.0) also intersects with Obstacle 2. To avoid this, I can add another waypoint at (2.0, 3.0) that moves the path to the right of the obstacle.

The third segment from (3.0, 3.0) to (4.0, 4.0) intersects with Obstacle 2 as well. To avoid this, I can add a waypoint at (3.5, 3.5) that allows the path to go around the top right corner of the obstacle.

With these changes, the new path would be:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), # start in the start set
    (1.0, 2.0),
    (2.0, 3.0),
    (3.5, 3.5),
    (4.5, 4.0) # end in the goal set
]

This new path avoids all the obstacles while still starting within the start set and ending within the goal set.

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), # Start in the start set
    (1.0, 2.0), # Move up to avoid Obstacle 2
    (2.0, 3.0), # Move diagonally up and right to clear Obstacle 2
    (3.0, 4.0), # Move up to the top of Obstacle 2
    (4.0, 4.0), # Move right to the edge of Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5) # Move diagonally up and right to reach the goal set
]

Explanation:
- The initial segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (1.0, 2.0) avoids the lower part of Obstacle 2.
- The next segment from (1.0, 2.0) to (2.0, 3.0) moves diagonally up and right to clear the top of Obstacle 2.
- The subsequent segment from (2.0, 3.0) to (3.0, 4.0) moves up to the top of Obstacle 2.
- The segment from (3.0, 4.0) to (4.0, 4.0) moves right to the edge of Obstacle 2.
- The final segment from (4.0, 4.0) to (4.5, 4.5) moves diagonally up and right to reach the goal set.

This revised path successfully avoids all the obstacles and connects the start and goal sets as required.

The key steps I will take are:

1. Analyze the spatial relationships between the path segments and the obstacles.
2. Identify the problematic segments that intersect with the obstacles.
3. Adjust the waypoints to create a new path that avoids the obstacles while still starting within the start set and ending within the goal set.

Analysis of the path and obstacles:
- The first segment between (1.0, 1.0) and (1.0, 2.0) intersects with Obstacle 2.
- The second segment between (1.0, 2.0) and (2.0, 3.0) also intersects with Obstacle 2.
- The third segment between (2.0, 3.0) and (3.0, 4.0) intersects with Obstacle 2.
- The fourth segment between (3.0, 4.0) and (4.0, 4.0) intersects with Obstacle 2.

To avoid these obstacles, I will modify the path by adding additional waypoints to create a new path that goes around the obstacles.

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), # Start in the start set
    (1.0, 2.0),
    (2.0, 3.0),
    (3.0, 3.0), # Adjust the path to go above Obstacle 2
    (4.0, 3.0),
    (4.5, 4.0), # Move diagonally to approach the goal set
    (4.5, 4.5) # End in the goal set
]

This new path avoids all the obstacles and still starts within the start set and ends within the goal set. The key changes are:
- Adding a waypoint at (3.0, 3.0) to go above Obstacle 2
- Adjusting the path between (3.0, 4.0) and (4.0, 4.0) to go diagonally and avoid the intersection with Obstacle 2

By modifying the waypoints and adjusting the path, I have created a new path that meets all the requirements and avoids the obstacles.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]

[09/06/2024 08:00:07 PM] Analyzing the provided path and the obstacles, I can see that the path is intersecting with Obstacle 2 in multiple segments. To avoid these intersections, I will modify the path to go around the obstacle.

The key steps I will take are:

1. Start the path at the top left corner of the start set, at (1.0, 1.0).
2. Move up to (1.0, 2.5) to clear the top of Obstacle 2.
3. Move right to (3.0, 2.5) to reach the gap between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2.
4. Move down to (3.0, 3.0) to enter the gap.
5. Move up to (4.0, 4.0) to reach the top of the goal set.
6. Move right to (4.5, 4.5) to end the path in the goal set.

The new path would be:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (1.0, 2.5),
    (3.0, 2.5),
    (3.0, 3.0),
    (4.0, 4.0),
    (4.5, 4.5)
]

This path should now avoid all the obstacles and start in the start set and end in the goal set.

[09/06/2024 08:00:10 PM] To avoid the obstacles and create a valid path, I will analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and make adjustments to the original path.

The first segment of the original path, from (1.0, 1.0) to (1.0, 2.5), intersects with Obstacle 2. This segment needs to be adjusted to avoid the obstacle.

Looking at the obstacle locations, I see a clear gap between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2 that the path can pass through. I can modify the path to take advantage of this gap.

The new path will be:
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start in the start set
    (1.0, 2.0),    # Move up to get level with the gap
    (2.5, 2.0),    # Move horizontally to reach the gap
    (2.5, 3.0),    # Move up through the gap
    (4.0, 4.0),    # Move up and right to the goal set
    (4.5, 4.5)     # End in the goal set
]

By adjusting the path to go through the gap between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2, I have ensured that the entire path avoids intersecting with any of the obstacles. The path starts in the start set, traverses through the gap, and ends in the goal set, meeting all the requirements.
