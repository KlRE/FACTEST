[09/06/2024 08:58:00 PM] Based on the provided information, I can suggest the following path that satisfies the given requirements:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), # Start within the start set
    (1.0, -0.0), # Move downward along the left edge of the start set
    (5.0, -0.0), # Move horizontally to the right, avoiding the obstacle
    (8.0, 1.0) # Move upward to end within the goal set
]

This path starts at the bottom-left corner of the start set, moves horizontally to the right to avoid the obstacle, and then moves upward to end within the goal set. The path avoids crossing any obstacles and connects the start and goal sets as required.

[09/06/2024 08:58:03 PM] Based on the provided feedback, it seems the original path you generated intersects with some obstacles, which is not allowed. Let's think through the steps to adjust the path to avoid the obstacles while still meeting the requirements.

First, let's look at the problematic segments:
- Segment 2 between points (1.0, -0.0) and (5.0, -0.0) intersects with Obstacle 1.
- Segment 3 between points (5.0, -0.0) and (8.0, 1.0) also intersects with Obstacle 1.

To avoid these intersections, we need to modify the path to go around the obstacle. One way to do this would be to add an additional waypoint at the edge of the obstacle, then continue towards the goal set.

The new path could look like this:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start in the start set
    (1.0, 0.0),  # Move downwards to avoid the obstacle
    (2.0, 0.0),  # Move horizontally to the edge of the obstacle
    (7.0, 0.0),  # Move horizontally to the other side of the obstacle
    (8.0, 1.0)   # Move upwards to the goal set
]

This new path avoids the obstacle by going around it. The key points are:
1. Start at (1.0, 1.0) within the start set.
2. Move downwards to (1.0, 0.0) to get below the obstacle.
3. Move horizontally to (2.0, 0.0) to reach the edge of the obstacle.
4. Move horizontally to (7.0, 0.0) to get past the obstacle.
5. Move upwards to (8.0, 1.0) to reach the goal set.

By adding the additional waypoint at (2.0, 0.0), the path is able to navigate around the obstacle and reach the goal set without intersecting any obstacles.

Please let me know if this revised path looks good or if you have any other feedback.

[09/06/2024 08:58:06 PM] To avoid the obstacle, we can modify the path as follows:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start in the start set
    (1.0, 0.0),   # Move down to avoid the obstacle
    (2.0, 0.0),   # Move right
    (6.0, 0.0),   # Move right to avoid the obstacle
    (8.0, 1.0)    # End in the goal set
]

Here's the thought process:

1. The initial path from (1.0, 1.0) to (2.0, 0.0) is valid as it does not intersect the obstacle.
2. However, the segment from (2.0, 0.0) to (7.0, 0.0) intersects with Obstacle 1, which is not allowed.
3. To avoid the obstacle, we need to adjust the path. We can move the waypoint at (7.0, 0.0) further to the right, to (6.0, 0.0), so that the path segment from (2.0, 0.0) to (6.0, 0.0) avoids the obstacle.
4. Finally, we can connect the last waypoint at (6.0, 0.0) to the goal set at (8.0, 1.0) to complete the path.

This modified path avoids the obstacle while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set.

[09/06/2024 08:58:08 PM] Understood. Let's analyze the path and make adjustments to avoid the obstacle.

From the provided path, the segment between the points (2.0, 0.0) and (6.0, 0.0) intersects with Obstacle 1. This segment needs to be modified to avoid the obstacle.

The key is to find a path that goes around the obstacle while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. We can add additional waypoints to create a detour around the obstacle.

Based on the spatial relationships, the following modified path should avoid the obstacle:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start in the start set
    (1.0, 0.0),
    (2.0, 0.0),
    (2.0, 2.0),  # Adjust the path to go above the obstacle
    (6.0, 2.0),
    (6.0, 0.0),
    (8.0, 1.0)   # End in the goal set
]

By adding the waypoints at (2.0, 2.0) and (6.0, 2.0), the path can now go above the obstacle without intersecting it. This ensures the path avoids the obstacle while still meeting the start and end requirements.

[09/06/2024 08:58:14 PM] Analyzing the provided path and the obstacles in the environment, I see that the segment between the waypoints (4.0, 2.0) and (6.0, 1.0) intersects with Obstacle 1, which is defined by the clockwise coordinates [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]. 

To avoid this obstacle, I will modify the path by adding additional waypoints to go around it. The idea is to climb up, move horizontally across the gap, and then descend down to the goal region.

The new path I propose is:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), # Start in the start set
    (1.0, 2.0), # Climb up
    (3.0, 2.0), # Move horizontally across the gap
    (7.0, 2.0), # Continue moving horizontally
    (8.0, 1.0) # Descend down to the goal set
]

This new path avoids the obstacle by going up to 2.0 on the y-axis, moving across the horizontal gap, and then descending down to the goal region. The waypoints are positioned such that the linear segments connecting them do not intersect with the obstacle.

By adding these extra waypoints, the path is able to navigate around the obstacle while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set, as required.

[09/06/2024 08:58:17 PM] Analyzing the provided path and the obstacles in the environment, I can see that the segment between the waypoints (3.0, 2.0) and (7.0, 2.0) intersects with the obstacle 1. To avoid this obstacle, I will adjust the path by adding additional waypoints to guide the path around the obstacle.

The new path will be as follows:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (1.0, 3.0),
    (5.0, 3.0),
    (5.0, 1.0),
    (8.0, 1.0)
]

Here's the reasoning behind this new path:

1. The path starts at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start set.
2. The second waypoint at (1.0, 3.0) lifts the path up and away from the obstacle.
3. The third waypoint at (5.0, 3.0) moves the path horizontally to the right, allowing it to clear the obstacle.
4. The fourth waypoint at (5.0, 1.0) brings the path down to the goal set level.
5. The final waypoint at (8.0, 1.0) places the path within the goal set.

By adjusting the path with these additional waypoints, the path now successfully avoids the obstacle and connects the start set to the goal set without any intersections.

[09/06/2024 08:58:21 PM] To avoid the obstacles, I propose the following revised path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (1.0, 3.0),
    (4.0, 3.0),
    (4.0, 1.0),
    (8.0, 1.0)
]

Here's the thought process behind this revised path:

1. The initial path segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (1.0, 3.0) is valid as it does not intersect any obstacles.

2. The next segment from (1.0, 3.0) to (5.0, 3.0) intersects with Obstacle 1. To avoid this, I adjusted the path to go through the gap between the obstacle and the goal set, by turning the path to the left and reaching (4.0, 3.0).

3. The segment from (4.0, 3.0) to (4.0, 1.0) is valid as it does not intersect any obstacles.

4. The final segment from (4.0, 1.0) to (8.0, 1.0) is also valid, as it passes through the gap between the obstacle and the goal set.

By adjusting the path to go through the available gaps between the obstacle and the goal set, I was able to generate a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids all obstacles.

[09/06/2024 08:58:26 PM] Okay, let's analyze the provided path and see how we can modify it to avoid the obstacle.

The initial path you provided was:
path = [(1.0, 1.0), (1.0, 3.0), (4.0, 3.0), (4.0, 1.0), (6.0, 1.0), (8.0, 1.0)]

Looking at the environment, we can see that the segment between the points (4.0, 1.0) and (6.0, 1.0) intersects with the obstacle. To avoid this, we need to modify the path to go around the obstacle.

One approach could be to go up and around the obstacle, maintaining a safe distance from it. Here's a possible revised path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start in the start set
    (1.0, 3.0),
    (4.0, 3.0),
    (4.0, 4.0),  # Go up to avoid the obstacle
    (5.0, 4.0),
    (5.0, 2.0),  # Go down to reach the goal set
    (8.0, 2.0),
    (8.0, 1.0)   # End in the goal set
]

This path avoids the obstacle by going up and around it, maintaining a safe distance. The key steps are:

1. Start at (1.0, 1.0) in the start set.
2. Move up to (4.0, 4.0) to get above the obstacle.
3. Move horizontally to (5.0, 4.0) to continue around the obstacle.
4. Move down to (5.0, 2.0) to reach the goal set.
5. Move horizontally to (8.0, 2.0) and then down to (8.0, 1.0) to end in the goal set.

This revised path ensures that the path and its segments do not intersect with the obstacle, while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set.

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

[09/06/2024 08:58:29 PM] Analyzing the provided path and the obstacles, I can see that the path intersects with Obstacle 1 in two segments:

1. The segment between the waypoints (5.0, 4.0) and (5.0, 2.0) intersects with Obstacle 1.
2. The segment between the waypoints (5.0, 2.0) and (8.0, 2.0) also intersects with Obstacle 1.

To avoid these intersections, I will modify the path to go around the obstacle. The new path will have the following waypoints:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start in the start set
    (1.0, 3.0),   # Move up to avoid the obstacle
    (4.0, 3.0),   # Move right to approach the goal
    (4.0, 4.0),   # Move up to clear the top of the obstacle
    (7.0, 4.0),   # Move right to the side of the obstacle
    (7.0, 2.0),   # Move down to the desired height
    (8.0, 2.0),   # Move right to the goal set
    (8.0, 1.0)    # End in the goal set
]

This new path avoids intersecting with Obstacle 1 by going over the top of it and then moving along the side. The waypoints are carefully chosen to maintain a safe distance from the obstacle and ensure the path stays within the start and goal sets.

[09/06/2024 08:58:32 PM] Analyzing the provided path and obstacles, I can see that there are a few issues with the current path. The path intersects with Obstacle 1 on two segments, which is not allowed as the path must avoid all obstacles.

To rectify this, I will modify the path to go around Obstacle 1 while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set.

The modified path will be:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), # Start in the start set
    (1.0, 3.0), # Move up to avoid Obstacle 1
    (4.0, 3.0), # Move right to reach the gap between Obstacle 1 and 2
    (4.0, 1.0), # Move down to lower altitude
    (8.0, 1.0)  # Move right to end in the goal set
]

This new path avoids all obstacles by:
1. Starting at (1.0, 1.0) within the start set.
2. Moving up to (1.0, 3.0) to get above Obstacle 1.
3. Moving right to (4.0, 3.0) to reach the gap between Obstacle 1 and 2.
4. Moving down to (4.0, 1.0) to lower the altitude.
5. Moving right to (8.0, 1.0) to end within the goal set.

The key changes are adding the waypoints at (1.0, 3.0) and (4.0, 1.0) to navigate around Obstacle 1 without intersecting it. This ensures the path is valid and meets all the requirements.

[09/06/2024 08:58:36 PM] Thank you for providing the path evaluation task. Let's analyze the current path and make the necessary adjustments to avoid the obstacle.

The initial path provided is:
path = [(1.0, 1.0), (1.0, 3.0), (4.0, 3.0), (4.0, 1.0), (8.0, 1.0)]

The feedback indicates that the segment between (4.0, 1.0) and (8.0, 1.0) intersects with Obstacle 1, which is defined by the coordinates [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]].

To avoid this obstacle, we need to adjust the path by adding additional waypoints to guide the path around the obstacle. Let's think through the process step-by-step:

1. The path starts correctly within the start set, so no change is needed for the initial waypoint.
2. The second waypoint at (1.0, 3.0) is also valid, as it avoids the obstacle.
3. The third waypoint at (4.0, 3.0) is also valid, as it continues the path without intersecting the obstacle.
4. The fourth waypoint at (4.0, 1.0) is the problematic one, as it intersects with the obstacle.
5. To avoid the obstacle, we can add an additional waypoint that guides the path around the obstacle. A suitable waypoint would be (6.0, 1.0), which is just outside the obstacle's bounds.
6. From (6.0, 1.0), we can continue the path to the final goal set by adding a waypoint at (8.0, 1.0).

The new, corrected path would be:
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (1.0, 3.0),
    (4.0, 3.0),
    (6.0, 1.0),
    (8.0, 1.0)
]

This new path starts in the start set, avoids the obstacle, and ends in the goal set, as required.

[09/06/2024 08:58:39 PM] Understood. Here is my analysis and the adjusted path that avoids the obstacle:

Based on the provided feedback, the original path intersects with Obstacle 1, which is not allowed. To avoid this obstacle, I will modify the path by adding additional waypoints to guide the path around the obstacle.

Chain of Thought:
1. The first three waypoints ((1.0, 1.0), (1.0, 3.0), (4.0, 3.0)) are all clear of obstacles.
2. The segment between (4.0, 3.0) and (6.0, 1.0) intersects with Obstacle 1, which needs to be avoided.
3. To go around Obstacle 1, I can add a waypoint at the top-right corner of the obstacle at (6.0, 4.0). This will allow the path to go over the obstacle.
4. From (6.0, 4.0), I can then descend down to the goal set at (8.0, 1.0).

New Path:
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (1.0, 3.0),
    (4.0, 3.0),
    (6.0, 4.0),
    (8.0, 1.0)
]

This new path avoids the obstacle and connects the start set to the goal set without intersecting any obstacles.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]

[09/06/2024 08:58:43 PM] Analyzing the provided path and obstacles, I can see that the path intersects with two of the obstacles, specifically the segments between the points (4.0, 3.0) and (6.0, 4.0), as well as the segment between (6.0, 4.0) and (8.0, 1.0). To avoid these obstacles, I will modify the path to go around them.

The first obstacle that the path intersects is defined by the vertices [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]. To avoid this obstacle, I can add an additional waypoint at (5.0, 3.0) between the points (4.0, 3.0) and (6.0, 4.0). This will allow the path to turn and go around the obstacle.

The second obstacle that the path intersects is the same as the first one. To avoid this obstacle, I can add another waypoint at (7.0, 2.0) between the points (6.0, 4.0) and (8.0, 1.0). This will allow the path to turn and go around the obstacle.

With these modifications, the new path that avoids the obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set is:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (1.0, 3.0),
    (4.0, 3.0),
    (5.0, 3.0),
    (6.0, 4.0),
    (7.0, 2.0),
    (8.0, 1.0)
]

This new path starts within the start set, avoids all obstacles, and ends within the goal set.

[09/06/2024 08:58:47 PM] Thank you for providing the path evaluation for iteration 15. Based on the feedback, it seems the path has some segments that intersect with the obstacles, so we need to adjust the path to avoid those obstacles.

Let's analyze the path step-by-step and see where the issues are:

1. The start point at (1.0, 1.0) is within the start set, which is good.
2. The next waypoint at (1.0, 3.0) is still clear of the obstacles.
3. The waypoint at (4.0, 3.0) is also clear of obstacles.
4. However, the segment between (5.0, 3.0) and (6.0, 4.0) intersects with Obstacle 1.
5. Similarly, the segment between (6.0, 4.0) and (7.0, 2.0) also intersects with Obstacle 1.
6. The final waypoint at (8.0, 1.0) is within the goal set, which is correct.

To avoid the obstacle intersections, we need to modify the path to go around Obstacle 1. A possible solution could be:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (1.0, 3.0),
    (4.0, 3.0),
    (5.0, 4.0),
    (7.0, 4.0),
    (7.5, 3.0),
    (8.0, 1.0)
]

The changes I made are:
1. Added a waypoint at (5.0, 4.0) to go above Obstacle 1.
2. Added a waypoint at (7.0, 4.0) to continue going around the obstacle.
3. Added a waypoint at (7.5, 3.0) to descend towards the goal set.

This new path should avoid intersecting with any of the obstacles and still start within the start set and end within the goal set.

[09/06/2024 08:58:50 PM] Based on the provided information and the identified issues with the original path, here is the revised path that avoids intersecting with the obstacles:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (1.0, 3.0),
    (4.0, 3.0),
    (5.0, 2.0),
    (7.0, 2.0),
    (8.0, 1.0)
]

Explanation:
1. The path starts at the (1.0, 1.0) point within the start set.
2. The path moves up to (1.0, 3.0) to avoid the obstacle.
3. The path then moves horizontally to (4.0, 3.0) to get closer to the goal set.
4. At this point, the path needs to navigate around the obstacle. Instead of going directly up to (5.0, 4.0) which intersects the obstacle, the path moves diagonally up and to the left to (5.0, 2.0).
5. The path then moves horizontally to (7.0, 2.0) to continue avoiding the obstacle.
6. Finally, the path moves diagonally up and to the right to (8.0, 1.0), which is within the goal set.

By adjusting the waypoints and avoiding direct movements that would intersect the obstacles, the revised path is able to navigate through the environment and reach the goal set without crossing any obstacles.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.0, 1.0], [8.0, 1.0], [8.0, -0.0], [9.0, -0.0]]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.0, 1.0), (1.0, 3.0), (4.0, 3.0), (5.0, 2.0), (7.0, 2.0), (8.0, 1.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    Obstacle Avoidance (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
		Segment 3 between points (4.0, 3.0) and (5.0, 2.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]

[09/06/2024 08:58:53 PM] Based on the provided feedback, the initial path you generated intersects with the obstacle, so it needs to be adjusted to avoid the obstacle. Here is my thought process and the new path that avoids the obstacle:

The main issue with the initial path is that the segments between the points (4.0, 3.0) and (5.0, 2.0), as well as the segment between (5.0, 2.0) and (7.0, 2.0), intersect with the obstacle defined by the coordinates [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]].

To avoid this obstacle, I will need to add additional waypoints to the path to create a path that goes around the obstacle. The key is to find a way to get from the point (4.0, 3.0) to the point (7.0, 2.0) without intersecting the obstacle.

One possible solution is to add a waypoint at (5.0, 3.0) and then another waypoint at (6.0, 2.0). This would allow the path to go around the obstacle by going up and to the right, rather than trying to cut through the middle of it.

Here is the new path that avoids the obstacle:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (1.0, 3.0),
    (4.0, 3.0),
    (5.0, 3.0),
    (6.0, 2.0),
    (7.0, 2.0),
    (8.0, 1.0)
]

This new path starts in the start set, goes up to (1.0, 3.0), then turns right to (4.0, 3.0). It then goes up to (5.0, 3.0) to get above the obstacle, then turns right to (6.0, 2.0) and finally down to (7.0, 2.0) to reach the goal set, avoiding the obstacle along the way.

[09/06/2024 08:58:56 PM] After analyzing the path, I see that the segments between points (5.0, 3.0) and (6.0, 2.0), as well as the segment between (6.0, 2.0) and (7.0, 2.0), intersect with the obstacle defined by the coordinates [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]. To avoid this obstacle, I will modify the path to go around it.

The new path will be:

    (1.0, 1.0),
    (1.0, 3.0),
    (4.0, 3.0),
    (4.0, 1.0),
    (7.0, 1.0),
    (8.0, 1.0)
]

The key changes are:
1. The path now goes up to (1.0, 3.0) and then across to (4.0, 3.0) to avoid the obstacle on the right side.
2. The path then descends to (4.0, 1.0) to avoid the obstacle on the left side.
3. The path then goes across to (7.0, 1.0) and up to the goal set at (8.0, 1.0).

This new path avoids intersecting with the obstacle while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set.

This means the path is not valid as it intersects with an obstacle.

To avoid the obstacle, I will modify the path by adding an additional waypoint to go around the obstacle. The new path will be:

The key changes are:
1. Added a waypoint at (1.0, 3.0) to move the path above the obstacle.
2. Added a waypoint at (4.0, 3.0) to move the path to the right side of the obstacle.
3. Directly connected the last two waypoints at (4.0, 3.0) and (8.0, 1.0) to reach the goal set, avoiding the obstacle.

    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.0, 1.0), (1.0, 3.0), (4.0, 3.0), (8.0, 1.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    Obstacle Avoidance (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
		Segment 3 between points (4.0, 3.0) and (8.0, 1.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/06/2024 08:59:02 PM] Analyzing the provided path and obstacles, I see that the segment between the points (4.0, 3.0) and (8.0, 1.0) intersects with Obstacle 1. To avoid this obstacle, I propose the following adjusted path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (1.0, 3.0), 
    (4.0, 3.0),
    (4.0, 1.0),
    (7.0, 1.0),
    (8.0, 1.0)
]

The key changes are:

1. The path continues straight up from (4.0, 3.0) to (4.0, 1.0), avoiding the obstacle.
2. Then, the path turns and moves horizontally to (7.0, 1.0) to bypass the obstacle.
3. Finally, the path turns and moves to the goal position at (8.0, 1.0).

This new path avoids intersecting with Obstacle 1 while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. The waypoints have been adjusted to create a collision-free path.
