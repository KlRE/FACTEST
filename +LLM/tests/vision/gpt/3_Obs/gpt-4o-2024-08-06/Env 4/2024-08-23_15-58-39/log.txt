# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

[08/23/2024 03:58:51 PM] ### Analysis:

1. **Initial Path and Issues:**
   - The original path starts at (1.0, 1.0) and goes through (9.0, 7.24), which is a valid breakpoint set.
   - The path segment from (15.0, 11.0) to (19.0, 19.0) intersects with Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3. Thus, this segment needs adjustment.
  
2. **Obstacle Avoidance:**
   - To avoid Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3, we can add a waypoint that navigates around them.
   - Ensure the path remains within the valid boundaries and moves around the obstacles while still heading towards the goal.

### Path Adjustment:

1. **Preserve Valid Subpath:**
   - Keep the valid subpath: [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 7.24), (15.0, 11.0)].

2. **New Waypoint Addition:**
   - Add a waypoint to navigate between Obstacles 1 and 3:
     - From (15.0, 11.0), head upwards and slightly to the right to avoid the intersection.
     - Choose a point that is clear from both obstacles, e.g., (16.5, 16.0).
  
3. **Connect to Goal:**
   - Finally, move from the new waypoint to the goal region, ending at (19.0, 19.0) as planned.

### New Path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),       # Start
    (9.0, 7.24),      # Breakpoint 1
    (15.0, 11.0),     # Before obstacle area
    (16.5, 16.0),     # New waypoint around obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)      # End in the goal set
] 

This path ensures that we avoid obstacles while still achieving the task requirements.

[08/23/2024 03:58:58 PM] ### Path Adjustment Process

1. **Starting Point:**
   - Our path starts at (1.0, 1.0), inside the start set, which is correct.

2. **Following the Valid Subpath:**
   - The longest valid subpath provided is:
     - Point A: (1.0, 1.0) – Starting Point
     - Point B: (9.0, 7.24) – Breakpoint

3. **Identifying and Avoiding the Obstacle:**
   - The segment between (15.0, 11.0) and (16.5, 16.0) intersects Obstacle 3.
   - We need to avoid this intersection and choose a waypoint that helps maneuver around the obstacle.

4. **Obstacle and Environment Analysis:**
   - Obstacle 3 is located close to the line connecting (15.0, 11.0) and (16.5, 16.0).
   - The goal is to navigate around this obstacle without contacting its boundaries.

5. **Path Adjustment:**
   - Introduce a waypoint that curves the path around Obstacle 3.
   - Once clear of the obstacle region, adjust the path to move towards the goal.

6. **New Waypoints:**
   - Start from the valid subpath, and adjust subsequent points:
   - Point C: After (15.0, 11.0), move upwards slightly to avoid Obstacle 3.
   - Point D: Navigate around the obstacle, ensuring a clear path.
   - Point E: End inside the goal set.

### New Path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),       # Start in the start set
    (9.0, 7.24),      # Pass through the first breakpoint
    (15.0, 11.0),     # Continue on the valid path
    (15.5, 15.0),     # Adjust path to curve around Obstacle 3
    (16.5, 17.5),     # Further adjust path to stay clear of Obstacle 3
    (19.0, 19.0)      # End in the goal set
]
```

### Summary:

The new path includes adjusted waypoints to bypass Obstacle 3 effectively. This ensures the path remains clear of obstacles while fulfilling all path requirements, starting at the required set, passing through a breakpoint, and ending inside the goal set.

[08/23/2024 03:59:06 PM] To adjust the path to avoid crossing obstacles, I'll consider the feedback provided, especially focusing on the segment that intersects with Obstacle 3. 

### Analysis:
1. **Valid Subpath**: The longest valid subpath suggested was [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 7.24), (15.0, 11.0), (15.5, 15.0)].
   
2. **Obstacle Intersection**: The problematic segment is between (15.5, 15.0) and (16.5, 17.5), as it crosses Obstacle 3.

3. **Path Correction**:
   - Start from the valid subpath [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 7.24), (15.0, 11.0), (15.5, 15.0)].
   - Instead of going directly to (16.5, 17.5), find a way around Obstacle 3.
   - Add a waypoint before the obstacle and navigate around the obstacle's vertices.
   - Finally, continue to the goal set.

### New Path Strategy:
1. **Start**: Begin at (1.0, 1.0) within the start set.
2. **First Breakpoint**: Proceed to the breakpoint (9.0, 7.24).
3. **Navigate Around Obstacle 3**:
   - Move from (9.0, 7.24) to (15.0, 11.0).
   - Then from (15.0, 11.0) to (15.5, 15.0).
   - Add a waypoint at (15.5, 18.0) to navigate above the obstacle.
4. **End at Goal Set**: Move to (19.0, 19.0) to reach the goal set.

### New Path:
```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),         # Start point
    (9.0, 7.24),        # First breakpoint
    (15.0, 11.0),       # Navigate upwards
    (15.5, 15.0),       # Continue upwards
    (15.5, 18.0),       # Waypoint above obstacle 3
    (19.0, 19.0)        # End point in the goal set
]
```

This path maintains the avoidance of obstacles and adheres to the provided requirements.

[08/23/2024 03:59:13 PM] ### Analysis and Path Adjustment

1. **Initial Path Review**:
   - The path starts at (1.0, 1.0) which is correctly placed within the start set.
   - The path ends at (19.0, 19.0) which appropriately lies within the goal set.

2. **Obstacle Crossing**:
   - The segment between (15.5, 18.0) and (19.0, 19.0) crossed Obstacle 3. Hence, this segment requires adjustment to navigate around the mentioned obstacle.

3. **Path Planning Strategy**:
   - Prior segments up to (15.5, 18.0) are valid and should be retained.
   - From (15.5, 18.0), we need to adjust the path to avoid Obstacle 3. This involves rerouting that segment to steer clear of the obstacle.

4. **Obstacle Avoidance**:
   - We can consider steering the path horizontally to avoid the obstacle, then vertically or diagonally towards the goal position. Evaluate the environment considering the obstacle layout and available space.

5. **Proposed Path Adjustments**:
   - From (15.5, 18.0), navigate slightly downward or to the side to create a buffer from the obstacle, such as (15.5, 17.5).
   - Continue the path towards the goal while avoiding obstacles, e.g., (17.0, 18.0) before moving to (19.0, 19.0).

### Analysis of Issues

- **Obstacle Intersection:** The issue occurs in Segment 6, which intersects with Obstacle 3. This segment is between the points (15.5, 17.5) and (17.0, 18.0).

- **Path Strategy:** Since the longest valid subpath ends at (15.5, 17.5), we need to divert around Obstacle 3. 

### Adjustments

1. **Diversion Points:** To avoid Obstacle 3, we can add a waypoint that moves horizontally or vertically around it, maintaining a safe distance.

2. **Adjust the Path:** Ensure it bypasses Obstacle 3 and continues to the goal.

### Proposed Solution

- **New Waypoints:**
  - Instead of heading directly northeast, divert the path to move horizontally/vertically around the obstacle.

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start in the start set
    (9.0, 7.24),   # Go through the breakpoint
    (15.0, 11.0),  # Continue upwards
    (15.5, 15.0),  # A bit further up
    (15.5, 17.5),  # The previous safe point before the obstacle
    (15.5, 19.0),  # Go around the obstacle by moving upwards
    (18.0, 19.0),  # Move horizontally to position above the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End in the goal set
]
```

### Explanation

- **Path Diversion:** By moving upwards to (15.5, 19.0) and then right to (18.0, 19.0), the path bypasses Obstacle 3 while ensuring no intersection occurs.
- **Continuing to Goal:** Finally, adjust to move towards the goal set ensuring the final waypoint is within the goal's bounds.

This new path efficiently avoids obstacles while utilizing the space around them, maintaining the constraints of the task.
