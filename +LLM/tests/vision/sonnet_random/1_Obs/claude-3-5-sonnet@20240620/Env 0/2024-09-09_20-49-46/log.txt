# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[16.5, 17.7], [13.3, 16.2], [16.5, 8.4], [17.1, 8.6]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 10.0)]

## Provided Image

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.

### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

[09/09/2024 08:49:52 PM] Based on the provided information and image, I'll propose a path that meets the requirements:

1. The path starts within the blue start set.
2. It avoids the red obstacle.
3. It passes through the required breakpoint.
4. It ends within the green goal set.
5. The path maintains a safe distance from the obstacle.

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start point within the start set
    (5.0, 5.0),     # Move diagonally to avoid the obstacle
    (9.0, 10.0),    # Pass through the required breakpoint
    (14.0, 14.0),   # Continue moving diagonally towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End point within the goal set
]

This path:
1. Begins at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the blue start set.
2. Moves diagonally to (5.0, 5.0) to start avoiding the obstacle.
3. Continues to (9.0, 10.0), which is the required breakpoint.
4. Proceeds to (14.0, 14.0), maintaining a safe distance from the obstacle.
5. Ends at (19.0, 19.0), which is within the green goal set.

The path maintains a diagonal trajectory, which allows it to efficiently move from start to goal while avoiding the obstacle. It also passes through the required breakpoint (9.0, 10.0). The waypoints are chosen to keep a safe distance from the obstacle, ensuring the path doesn't intersect or touch it at any point.

		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.

[09/09/2024 08:50:00 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and the current situation. I'll analyze the environment and suggest a new path that avoids the obstacle while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the current path are correct, being within the start and goal sets respectively.
2. The path correctly passes through the required breakpoint (9.0, 10.0).
3. The issue occurs in the final segment between (14.0, 14.0) and (19.0, 19.0), which intersects with Obstacle 1.

To correct this, we need to modify the path to go around Obstacle 1. Let's consider the spatial relationships:

1. Obstacle 1 is positioned in the upper-right quadrant of the graph, between our last valid point (14.0, 14.0) and the goal set.
2. The obstacle appears to be elongated vertically, with its narrower dimension horizontally.
3. There seems to be more space below the obstacle than above it.

Based on this analysis, I suggest modifying the path to go underneath the obstacle. Here's the thought process for the new path:

1. Keep the first four waypoints as they are valid: (1.0, 1.0), (5.0, 5.0), (9.0, 10.0), (14.0, 14.0)
2. From (14.0, 14.0), move to a point below the obstacle, around (16.0, 8.0). This should clear the lower edge of the obstacle.
3. Then move horizontally past the obstacle to around (18.0, 8.0).
4. Finally, move diagonally up to the goal set, aiming for a point like (19.0, 19.0).

Here's the suggested new path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (5.0, 5.0),
    (9.0, 10.0),
    (14.0, 14.0),
    (16.0, 8.0),
    (18.0, 8.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]

This path should:
1. Start in the correct start set
2. Pass through the required breakpoint (9.0, 10.0)
3. Avoid intersecting with Obstacle 1 by going underneath it
4. End in the correct goal set

The additional waypoints allow the path to navigate around the obstacle while maintaining a safe distance. This solution keeps the valid parts of the original path and adds new points to avoid the collision, resulting in a path that meets all the given requirements.
