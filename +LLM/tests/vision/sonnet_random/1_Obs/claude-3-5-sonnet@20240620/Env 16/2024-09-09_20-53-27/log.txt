# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[16.9, 17.4], [16.0, 17.9], [16.1, 16.1], [16.7, 13.1]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 10.0)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

[09/09/2024 08:53:53 PM] Based on the provided information and the image, I'll plan a path that meets the requirements. Here's my analysis and proposed path:

1. The start set is in the bottom-left corner (blue square).
2. The goal set is in the top-right corner (green square).
3. There's one obstacle near the top-right corner.
4. There's one breakpoint at (9.0, 10.0) that the path must pass through.

The path should start in the blue square, avoid the obstacle, pass through the breakpoint, and end in the green square. Here's a suitable path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start point within the start set
    (5.0, 5.0),     # Move diagonally away from the start
    (9.0, 10.0),    # Pass through the required breakpoint
    (15.0, 15.0),   # Move towards the goal while avoiding the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End point within the goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set at (1.0, 1.0)
2. Moves diagonally to (5.0, 5.0) to get away from the start area
3. Passes through the required breakpoint at (9.0, 10.0)
4. Continues moving towards the goal while staying clear of the obstacle by going to (15.0, 15.0)
5. Ends within the goal set at (19.0, 19.0)

The path avoids the obstacle by maintaining a safe distance from it. The linear segments between these waypoints do not intersect with the obstacle, and the path fulfills all the given requirements.

    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

[09/09/2024 08:54:01 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and suggest a new path that avoids the obstacle while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The current path intersects with Obstacle 1 between points (15.0, 15.0) and (19.0, 19.0).
2. The longest valid subpath is [(1.0, 1.0), (5.0, 5.0), (9.0, 10.0), (15.0, 15.0)].
3. We need to adjust the path after (15.0, 15.0) to avoid Obstacle 1.
4. The obstacle is positioned in a way that blocks a direct path to the goal, so we need to go around it.
5. We'll add waypoints to navigate around the obstacle while maintaining a safe distance.
6. The breakpoint (9.0, 10.0) is already included in the valid subpath, so we don't need to modify that part.

Path Adjustment:
1. Keep the valid subpath up to (15.0, 15.0).
2. Add a waypoint to move horizontally to avoid the left edge of the obstacle.
3. Add another waypoint to move vertically above the obstacle.
4. Add a final waypoint to reach the goal set safely.

New path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 5.0),    # Intermediate point (unchanged)
    (9.0, 10.0),   # Breakpoint (unchanged)
    (15.0, 15.0),  # Last valid point from previous path
    (15.5, 15.0),  # Move slightly right to avoid the left edge of the obstacle
    (15.5, 18.5),  # Move upward to clear the top of the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Final point in the goal set
]

This new path maintains the valid portions of the original path, including the start point, breakpoint, and the approach to the obstacle. It then adds waypoints to safely navigate around Obstacle 1 before reaching the goal set. The path avoids intersecting with the obstacle while maintaining a safe distance, and it meets all the requirements specified in the task.
