# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[13.9, 19.6], [15.8, 13.9], [16.4, 14.6], [15.5, 19.4]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 10.0)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

[09/09/2024 08:50:57 PM] Based on the provided information and the image, I'll plan a path that meets the requirements:

1. The path starts in the blue start set (lower left corner).
2. It ends in the green goal set (upper right corner).
3. It avoids the red obstacle.
4. It passes through the given breakpoint (9.0, 10.0).

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start point within the start set
    (5.0, 5.0),     # Move diagonally up and right
    (9.0, 10.0),    # Pass through the required breakpoint
    (14.0, 12.0),   # Move further up and right, avoiding the obstacle
    (17.0, 16.0),   # Continue moving up and right
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End point within the goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the blue start set at (1.0, 1.0).
2. Moves diagonally up and to the right, staying clear of the obstacle.
3. Passes through the required breakpoint at (9.0, 10.0).
4. Continues moving upward and to the right, giving a wide berth to the red obstacle.
5. Ends within the green goal set at (19.0, 19.0).

The path avoids the obstacle by staying well below and to the left of it. It takes a smooth, diagonal route that efficiently connects the start and goal sets while satisfying all the given constraints.

[09/09/2024 08:51:05 PM] Thank you for providing the detailed information about the motion planning task and the feedback on the previous path. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacle while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the previous path were correct.
2. The path correctly passed through the required breakpoint (9.0, 10.0).
3. The issue occurs between points (14.0, 12.0) and (17.0, 16.0), where the path intersects with Obstacle 1.

To correct this, we need to adjust the path after the point (14.0, 12.0) to avoid Obstacle 1. Let's consider the shape and position of Obstacle 1:
[[13.9, 19.6], [15.8, 13.9], [16.4, 14.6], [15.5, 19.4]]

We can see that the obstacle is angled and extends from about y=14 to y=20. To avoid it, we should plan a path that goes either below or around it.

New path planning:
1. Keep the first four points of the valid subpath: (1.0, 1.0), (5.0, 5.0), (9.0, 10.0), (14.0, 12.0)
2. From (14.0, 12.0), we'll move slightly to the right and up, but staying below the obstacle: (15.0, 13.5)
3. Then, we'll move further right and up, passing to the right of the obstacle: (17.0, 15.0)
4. Finally, we'll move to the goal set: (19.0, 19.0)

This path should avoid the obstacle while still reaching the goal set. Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (5.0, 5.0),
    (9.0, 10.0),
    (14.0, 12.0),
    (15.0, 13.5),
    (17.0, 15.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]

This new path maintains the correct start and end points, passes through the required breakpoint (9.0, 10.0), and should avoid intersecting with Obstacle 1 by passing below and to the right of it. The additional waypoints provide more control over the path's trajectory, allowing it to navigate around the obstacle more precisely.

[09/09/2024 08:51:14 PM] Thank you for providing the detailed information and feedback. I'll analyze the situation and suggest a new path that avoids the obstacle intersection.

Looking at the feedback, we can see that the path was valid up to the point (15.0, 13.5). The next segment from (15.0, 13.5) to (17.0, 15.0) intersects with Obstacle 1. Let's adjust the path to avoid this intersection while still reaching the goal and passing through the required breakpoint.

Analyzing the spatial relationships:
1. The breakpoint (9.0, 10.0) is already included in the valid subpath, so we don't need to worry about that.
2. Obstacle 1 is positioned in the upper-right quadrant of the space, roughly between (13.9, 13.9) and (16.4, 19.6).
3. We need to find a way around this obstacle to reach the goal set at (18-20, 18-20).

Let's adjust the path:

1. We'll keep the valid subpath up to (15.0, 13.5).
2. Instead of going directly to (17.0, 15.0), we'll add a waypoint to go around the bottom of the obstacle.
3. Then we'll add another waypoint to move upwards, clearing the obstacle.
4. Finally, we'll add a point to reach the goal set.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 5.0),    # Intermediate point (unchanged)
    (9.0, 10.0),   # Breakpoint (unchanged)
    (14.0, 12.0),  # Intermediate point (unchanged)
    (15.0, 13.5),  # Last valid point from previous path
    (16.5, 13.5),  # New point to go around the bottom of the obstacle

This new path should avoid intersecting with Obstacle 1 by going around its bottom edge and then moving upwards to reach the goal set. The path still starts in the start set, passes through the required breakpoint, and ends in the goal set. It also maintains a safe distance from the obstacle to avoid any potential touching or crossing.
