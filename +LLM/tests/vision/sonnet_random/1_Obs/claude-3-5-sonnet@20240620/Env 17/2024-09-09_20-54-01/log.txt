# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[17.1, 18.0], [16.7, 14.7], [18.1, 13.8], [19.2, 15.9]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 10.0)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

[09/09/2024 08:54:08 PM] Based on the provided information and image, I'll devise a path that meets the requirements. Let's analyze the environment:

1. The start set is a blue square in the bottom-left corner.
2. The goal set is a green square in the top-right corner.
3. There's one obstacle (red quadrilateral) near the top-right, but it doesn't block the direct path between start and goal.
4. There's one breakpoint at (9.0, 10.0) that the path must pass through.

Considering these factors, here's a suitable path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start set
    (5.0, 5.0),  # Move diagonally towards the breakpoint
    (9.0, 10.0),  # Pass through the required breakpoint
    (14.0, 14.0),  # Move towards the goal, avoiding the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End within the goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the blue start set.
2. Passes through the required breakpoint at (9.0, 10.0).
3. Avoids the obstacle by staying well below and to the left of it.
4. Ends within the green goal set.
5. Uses arbitrary waypoints that aren't always parallel to an axis, allowing for diagonal movements.
6. Maintains a safe distance from the obstacle to ensure no intersection or touching occurs.

The path takes a fairly direct route while satisfying all the given constraints. It starts from the bottom-left of the start set, moves diagonally to approach the breakpoint, passes through it, then continues diagonally towards the goal while giving a wide berth to the obstacle, and finally ends in the top-left of the goal set.

[09/09/2024 08:54:15 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacle while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The current path is valid up to the point (14.0, 14.0).
2. The last segment from (14.0, 14.0) to (19.0, 19.0) intersects with Obstacle 1.
3. We need to adjust the path to go around Obstacle 1 while still reaching the goal set.
4. The breakpoint (9.0, 10.0) is already included in the valid part of the path, so we don't need to modify that.

Proposed solution:
1. Keep the first four waypoints of the original path as they are valid.
2. Add new waypoints to navigate around Obstacle 1.
3. End the path within the goal set.

Here's my thought process for adjusting the path:

1. From (14.0, 14.0), we need to move more to the left to avoid Obstacle 1.
2. We can add a point at (15.5, 16.0) which is to the left of the obstacle.
3. Then, we can add another point at (17.5, 17.5) to move above the obstacle.
4. Finally, we can reach the goal set with a point at (19.0, 19.0).

New path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (5.0, 5.0),
    (9.0, 10.0),
    (14.0, 14.0),
    (15.5, 16.0),
    (17.5, 17.5),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]

This new path should:
1. Start in the correct start set
2. End in the correct goal set
3. Pass through the required breakpoint (9.0, 10.0)
4. Avoid intersecting with Obstacle 1 by going around its left side
5. Maintain a safe distance from the obstacle

This solution keeps the valid part of the original path and adds new waypoints to navigate around the obstacle, ensuring a collision-free path to the goal.

[09/09/2024 08:54:24 PM] Thank you for providing the detailed information and feedback. I'll analyze the situation and suggest a new path that avoids the obstacle intersection.

Analyzing the environment:
1. The path was correct up to the point (15.5, 16.0).
2. The segment between (15.5, 16.0) and (17.5, 17.5) intersects with Obstacle 1.
3. We need to adjust the path to go around Obstacle 1 while still reaching the goal set.
4. The breakpoint at (9.0, 10.0) is already included in the valid part of the path, so we don't need to worry about that.

Adjusting the path:
1. We'll keep the valid part of the path up to (15.5, 16.0).
2. To avoid Obstacle 1, we'll add a waypoint to go around its left side, as there seems to be more space there.
3. After avoiding the obstacle, we'll add another waypoint to approach the goal set.
4. Finally, we'll end the path inside the goal set.

Here's the new suggested path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 5.0),    # Waypoint 1 (unchanged)
    (9.0, 10.0),   # Breakpoint (unchanged)
    (14.0, 14.0),  # Waypoint 3 (unchanged)
    (15.5, 16.0),  # Last valid point before obstacle
    (16.0, 17.5),  # New waypoint to avoid Obstacle 1 (left side)
    (17.0, 18.5),  # New waypoint to approach goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point inside goal set
]

This new path should:
1. Start in the correct start set
2. Pass through the required breakpoint (9.0, 10.0)
3. Avoid intersecting with Obstacle 1 by going around its left side
4. End inside the goal set

The adjustment between (15.5, 16.0) and (16.0, 17.5) should provide enough clearance to avoid Obstacle 1, while the following waypoint at (17.0, 18.5) helps to navigate towards the goal set without intersecting the obstacle. The final segment to (19.0, 19.0) ensures the path ends within the goal set.

This path maintains a safe distance from the obstacle while efficiently reaching the goal. If this path still intersects with the obstacle or doesn't meet any other requirements, please provide feedback, and I'll make further adjustments.
