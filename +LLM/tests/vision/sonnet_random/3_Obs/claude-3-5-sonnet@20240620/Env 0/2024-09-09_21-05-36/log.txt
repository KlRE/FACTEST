# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 17.1], [8.2, 10.8], [6.9, 14.8], [2.5, 19.5]]
			Obstacle 2: [[17.1, 17.3], [5.8, 18.9], [5.9, 17.6], [8.0, 16.3]]
			Obstacle 3: [[12.0, 15.2], [18.2, 13.8], [17.8, 19.6], [12.9, 17.9]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 7.2), (9.0, 20.22)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

[09/09/2024 09:05:55 PM] Based on the provided information and the image, I'll plan a path that meets the requirements. Let's analyze the environment:

1. The start set is a blue square in the bottom-left corner.
2. The goal set is a green square in the top-right corner.
3. There are three red obstacles forming a complex shape in the upper half of the image.
4. There's a breakpoint set with two points: (9.0, 7.2) and (9.0, 20.22).

Here's a path that avoids obstacles, starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and passes through one of the breakpoints:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (1.0, 5.0),    # Move up to avoid the lower part of obstacles
    (9.0, 7.2),    # Move to the lower breakpoint, avoiding obstacles
    (15.0, 7.2),   # Move right, staying below obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set at (1.0, 1.0).
2. Moves upward to avoid the lower parts of the obstacles.
3. Navigates to the lower breakpoint at (9.0, 7.2), which is required.
4. Moves right while staying below the obstacles.
5. Finally, moves up and slightly right to end within the goal set at (19.0, 19.0).

This path should successfully avoid all obstacles while meeting all the stated requirements.

[09/09/2024 09:06:03 PM] Thank you for providing the detailed information and feedback. Let's analyze the situation and develop a new path that meets all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The current path is valid up to the point (15.0, 7.2).
2. The last segment from (15.0, 7.2) to (19.0, 19.0) intersects with Obstacle 3.
3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 3 to reach the goal set.
4. The breakpoint (9.0, 7.2) is already included in the valid part of the path.

Let's devise a new path:

1. We'll keep the valid part of the path up to (15.0, 7.2).
2. From there, we need to navigate around Obstacle 3.
3. Looking at the image, it appears there's a gap between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3 that we can utilize.
4. We'll add a waypoint to move slightly upwards to avoid Obstacle 3.
5. Then, we'll move towards the goal set while staying clear of all obstacles.

Here's the revised path with explanations:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start point within the start set
    (1.0, 5.0),  # Move upwards to avoid potential obstacles
    (9.0, 7.2),  # Use the required breakpoint
    (15.0, 7.2), # Continue on the valid part of the previous path
    (16.0, 10.0), # Move upwards to avoid Obstacle 3
    (17.5, 15.0), # Navigate through the gap between Obstacle 2 and 3
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End point within the goal set
]

Explanation of changes:
1. The first four waypoints remain the same as they were valid.
2. We added (16.0, 10.0) to move upwards and avoid Obstacle 3.
3. The point (17.5, 15.0) helps us navigate through the gap between Obstacle 2 and 3.
4. Finally, we reach (19.0, 19.0) which is within the goal set.

This path should avoid all obstacles while still meeting the requirements of starting in the start set, ending in the goal set, and passing through the required breakpoint. The added waypoints create a smoother curve around the obstacles, reducing the risk of intersection.

Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/09/2024 09:06:13 PM] Thank you for providing the detailed information and feedback on the previous path attempt. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the previous path were correct.
2. The path successfully passed through the required breakpoint (9.0, 7.2).
3. The main issue was the intersection with Obstacle 3 between points (16.0, 10.0) and (17.5, 15.0).

Let's adjust the path to avoid this intersection:

1. We'll keep the initial part of the path up to (15.0, 7.2) as it's valid.
2. From there, we need to navigate around Obstacle 3 to reach the goal.
3. We can move slightly upwards and then to the right to avoid Obstacle 3.
4. Then, we'll curve around the top-right corner of Obstacle 3 to reach the goal area.

Here's the revised path with explanations:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point within the start set
    (1.0, 5.0),    # Move upward to avoid potential obstacles
    (9.0, 7.2),    # Pass through the required breakpoint
    (15.0, 7.2),   # Continue to the right
    (16.5, 8.5),   # Move slightly upward and right to start avoiding Obstacle 3
    (18.5, 13.0),  # Continue moving up and right, staying clear of Obstacle 3
    (19.0, 16.0),  # Move further up, preparing to enter the goal area
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Enter the goal area
]

Reasoning:
1. The path starts at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start set.
2. It moves upward to (1.0, 5.0) to gain some clearance from potential obstacles.
3. The path then goes through the required breakpoint at (9.0, 7.2).
4. From (15.0, 7.2), instead of going straight up (which caused the previous intersection), we now move slightly upward and to the right to (16.5, 8.5). This helps us start avoiding Obstacle 3.
5. We continue moving up and right to (18.5, 13.0), which keeps us clear of Obstacle 3's top-right corner.
6. The path then moves further up to (19.0, 16.0), preparing to enter the goal area.
7. Finally, it reaches (19.0, 19.0), which is within the goal set.

This revised path should avoid all obstacles while meeting the requirements of starting in the start set, ending in the goal set, and passing through the specified breakpoint. The gradual curve around Obstacle 3 ensures that we maintain a safe distance from it throughout the path.
