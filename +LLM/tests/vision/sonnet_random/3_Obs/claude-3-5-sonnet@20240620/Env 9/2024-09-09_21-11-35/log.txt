# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[14.1, 17.2], [10.7, 6.0], [18.4, 10.0], [19.4, 12.6]]
			Obstacle 2: [[5.9, 8.9], [9.9, 1.2], [14.8, 11.3], [13.5, 12.1]]
			Obstacle 3: [[5.6, 9.0], [14.0, 9.4], [15.7, 16.4], [6.5, 12.7]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 0.47), (9.0, 17.85)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[09/09/2024 09:11:54 PM] After analyzing the environment and the given constraints, I propose the following path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start set
    (5.0, 1.0),  # Move right to avoid the lower obstacle
    (9.0, 0.47),  # Pass through the first breakpoint
    (15.0, 5.0),  # Move up and right to avoid the middle obstacle
    (17.0, 14.0),  # Continue moving up and slightly right to avoid the upper obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set
]

This path satisfies the requirements:

1. It starts within the start set at (1.0, 1.0).
2. It ends within the goal set at (19.0, 19.0).
3. It passes through one of the breakpoints (9.0, 0.47) from the given breakpoint set.
4. It avoids all obstacles by maintaining a safe distance from them.
5. The path doesn't cross any obstacles.

The path first moves to the right to avoid the lower obstacle, then passes through the required breakpoint. It then moves upwards and to the right, navigating between the obstacles. Finally, it moves towards the upper-right corner to reach the goal set.

This path provides a smooth trajectory that satisfies all the given constraints while maintaining a safe distance from the obstacles.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[09/09/2024 09:12:02 PM] Thank you for providing the detailed information and feedback on the previous path. Let's analyze the situation and create a new path that avoids obstacles and meets all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The valid subpath [(1.0, 1.0), (5.0, 1.0), (9.0, 0.47), (15.0, 5.0)] provides a good start, but we need to adjust the route after this point.
2. The main issue is that the path intersects with Obstacle 1 between (15.0, 5.0) and (17.0, 14.0).
3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 1 while also avoiding Obstacles 2 and 3.
4. The breakpoint (9.0, 0.47) is already included in the valid subpath, so we don't need to worry about that requirement.

Path Adjustment Strategy:
1. Keep the valid subpath up to (15.0, 5.0).
2. From (15.0, 5.0), we need to move towards the goal while avoiding Obstacle 1.
3. We can try to go around Obstacle 1 by moving to the right and then up.
4. After clearing Obstacle 1, we can move towards the goal set.

New Path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 1.0),    # Second point (unchanged)
    (9.0, 0.47),   # Breakpoint (unchanged)
    (15.0, 5.0),   # Last valid point from previous path
    (19.5, 5.0),   # Move right to clear Obstacle 1
    (19.5, 13.0),  # Move up, staying clear of Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move to the goal set
]

Explanation:
1. The first four points remain unchanged as they form a valid subpath.
2. From (15.0, 5.0), we move right to (19.5, 5.0) to clear Obstacle 1 on its right side. The x-coordinate 19.5 is chosen to provide a safe distance from both Obstacle 1 and the right edge of the environment.
3. We then move upwards to (19.5, 13.0), which should clear the top of Obstacle 1 while staying within the environment boundaries.
4. Finally, we move diagonally to (19.0, 19.0), which is within the goal set.

This path should avoid all obstacles while meeting the start and end position requirements, as well as including the necessary breakpoint. The path takes a wider route around Obstacle 1 to ensure it doesn't intersect with any obstacles.
