# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[0.9, 18.5], [-0.0, 7.5], [5.8, 10.7], [9.8, 18.1]]
			Obstacle 2: [[13.0, 18.2], [6.8, 15.3], [8.9, 15.2], [11.7, 16.1]]
			Obstacle 3: [[12.5, 8.3], [15.3, 5.5], [15.7, 14.9], [14.9, 16.1]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 6.62), (9.0, 16.47), (9.0, 20.06)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[09/09/2024 09:07:38 PM] Based on the provided information and image, I'll plan a path that meets the requirements:

1. The path starts in the blue start set at the bottom left.
2. It needs to avoid the red obstacle areas.
3. It must pass through one of the breakpoints in the given set.
4. The path ends in the green goal set at the top right.

Here's a proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the blue start set
    (3.0, 4.0),    # Move diagonally up and right to avoid the first obstacle
    (6.0, 5.0),    # Continue moving up and right
    (9.0, 6.62),   # Pass through one of the provided breakpoints
    (12.0, 10.0),  # Move up and right to avoid the middle obstacle
    (16.0, 15.0),  # Continue moving towards the goal while avoiding the upper obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the green goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the blue start set at (1.0, 1.0).
2. Avoids all red obstacle areas by maintaining a safe distance.
3. Passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 6.62) from the provided set.
4. Ends within the green goal set at (19.0, 19.0).

The path takes a diagonal route from the start, curving slightly to pass through the required breakpoint, then continues diagonally towards the goal while avoiding obstacles. It maintains a safe distance from all obstacles throughout its trajectory.

		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[09/09/2024 09:07:56 PM] Thank you for providing the detailed information about the path planning task and the feedback on the previously generated path. I'll analyze the situation and suggest a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the previous path were correct.
2. The path successfully passed through one of the breakpoints (9.0, 6.62).
3. The issue occurred in the segment between (12.0, 10.0) and (16.0, 15.0), which intersected with Obstacle 3.

To correct this, we need to adjust the path after the point (12.0, 10.0) to avoid Obstacle 3. We'll try to go around the obstacle while maintaining a safe distance.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Keep the initial part of the path up to (12.0, 10.0) as it was valid.
2. To avoid Obstacle 3, we'll curve the path to the left, going around its western edge.
3. After passing the obstacle, we'll adjust the path towards the goal set.
4. We'll maintain the use of the breakpoint (9.0, 6.62) as it worked well in the previous attempt.

Here's the suggested new path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point in the start set
    (3.0, 4.0),    # Initial waypoint
    (6.0, 5.0),    # Second waypoint
    (9.0, 6.62),   # Breakpoint from Set 1
    (12.0, 10.0),  # Last valid point from previous path
    (11.0, 13.0),  # New point to curve left around Obstacle 3
    (12.0, 16.0),  # Point to pass north of Obstacle 3
    (15.0, 17.5),  # Point to start approaching the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point in the goal set
]

This new path should:
1. Start in the correct start set
2. End in the correct goal set
3. Pass through the required breakpoint (9.0, 6.62)
4. Avoid all obstacles, particularly by curving around Obstacle 3
5. Provide a smooth and feasible trajectory from start to goal

The adjustment between points (12.0, 10.0) and (11.0, 13.0) allows the path to move left and upward, avoiding the western edge of Obstacle 3. The subsequent points guide the path safely around the obstacle and towards the goal set. This new path should resolve the intersection issue while maintaining all other requirements of the task.
