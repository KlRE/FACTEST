# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[13.9, 6.0], [16.8, 7.1], [16.4, 16.0], [14.1, 11.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[19.7, 17.5], [17.2, 17.5], [18.2, 17.3], [19.3, 17.3]]
			Obstacle 3: [[10.7, 8.3], [16.3, 0.8], [17.5, 12.2], [16.4, 14.6]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 10.0)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[09/09/2024 09:16:38 PM] Based on the provided information and image, I'll plan a path that meets the requirements. Here's my analysis and proposed path:

1. The start set is a blue square in the bottom-left corner.
2. The goal set is a green square in the top-right corner.
3. There are two large red obstacles: one in the middle-left and another in the top-middle of the image.
4. There's a small red obstacle near the goal set.
5. There's a breakpoint at (9.0, 10.0) that the path must pass through.

Considering these factors, here's a path that avoids obstacles, starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and passes through the required breakpoint:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start set
    (3.0, 3.0),  # Move diagonally up and right to avoid the lower obstacle
    (9.0, 10.0),  # Pass through the required breakpoint
    (17.0, 13.0),  # Move up and right to avoid the upper obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the blue start set
2. Moves diagonally to avoid the lower-left part of the first large obstacle
3. Passes through the required breakpoint at (9.0, 10.0)
4. Curves around the upper-right part of the second large obstacle
5. Approaches the goal set from above to avoid the small obstacle near it
6. Ends within the green goal set

The path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles while meeting all the specified requirements.

    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[09/09/2024 09:16:55 PM] Thank you for providing the detailed information and feedback. Let's analyze the situation and create a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct.
2. The path correctly passed through the breakpoint (9.0, 10.0).
3. The issue occurs between points (9.0, 10.0) and (17.0, 13.0), intersecting with Obstacles 1 and 3.

Let's create a new path that avoids these obstacles:

1. We'll keep the first three waypoints as they are valid: (1.0, 1.0), (3.0, 3.0), and (9.0, 10.0).
2. From (9.0, 10.0), we need to navigate around Obstacles 1 and 3.
3. We can go above Obstacle 1 by moving to a point like (12.0, 16.5).
4. From there, we can move towards the goal while staying above Obstacles 1 and 3.
5. Finally, we'll enter the goal set from above.

Here's the new path with explanations:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start point (unchanged)
    (3.0, 3.0),  # Intermediate point (unchanged)
    (9.0, 10.0),  # Breakpoint (unchanged)
    (12.0, 16.5),  # New point to avoid Obstacles 1 and 3 by going above them
    (17.0, 17.5),  # New point to approach the goal set while staying clear of obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point in the goal set (unchanged)
]

This new path should satisfy all the requirements:
1. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
2. It passes through the required breakpoint (9.0, 10.0).
3. It avoids all obstacles by maintaining a safe distance from them.
4. The path is represented as an array of waypoints that can be connected linearly without crossing any obstacles.

The key adjustment was adding two new waypoints to navigate around the obstacles in the center of the map. By going above the obstacles, we create a clear path to the goal set without any intersections.
