# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[0.7, 18.1], [2.7, 15.1], [11.8, 13.8], [8.3, 18.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[19.9, 14.3], [14.8, 9.5], [14.9, 7.7], [19.0, 2.3]]
			Obstacle 3: [[17.9, 6.2], [20.0, 5.8], [19.4, 14.6], [19.2, 13.5]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 6.1), (9.0, 19.58)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/09/2024 09:11:35 PM] Based on the provided information and image, I'll plan a path that meets the requirements. Let's analyze the environment:

1. The start set is in the bottom-left corner (blue rectangle).
2. The goal set is in the top-right corner (green rectangle).
3. There are three obstacles (red shapes) to avoid.
4. We need to pass through one of the breakpoints in the given set.

Considering these factors, here's a proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start set
    (3.0, 3.0),  # Move diagonally to avoid the first obstacle
    (9.0, 6.1),  # Pass through the first breakpoint
    (13.0, 10.0),  # Navigate between obstacles
    (16.0, 15.0),  # Continue moving towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the blue start set.
2. Avoids the first large triangular obstacle by moving diagonally.
3. Passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 6.1) as required.
4. Navigates between the obstacles, maintaining a safe distance.
5. Approaches the goal set from a direction that avoids the nearby obstacles.
6. Ends within the green goal set.

The path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles and does not intersect with any of them. It also fulfills the requirement of passing through one of the given breakpoints. The waypoints are chosen to create a smooth path that efficiently navigates the environment while meeting all the specified criteria.
