# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[12.5, 14.1], [12.8, 11.4], [17.3, 18.1], [12.6, 17.7]]
			Obstacle 2: [[1.0, 19.5], [5.8, 16.4], [12.9, 16.6], [10.9, 19.2]]
			Obstacle 3: [[18.6, 8.2], [17.1, 5.7], [19.0, 6.0], [19.9, 7.0]]
			Obstacle 4: [[11.1, 19.9], [10.2, 16.5], [10.3, 16.2], [18.3, 12.3]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 7.24), (9.0, 20.62)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

[09/09/2024 09:28:53 PM] Based on the provided image and data, I'll devise a path that meets the requirements. Let's analyze the environment:

1. The start set is a small blue square in the bottom-left corner.
2. The goal set is a small green square in the top-right corner.
3. There are several red obstacles, with a large one in the center-right area.
4. There's a breakpoint set with two points, one of which we need to pass through.

Let's plan a path that avoids obstacles and meets all requirements:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the blue start set
    (4.0, 3.0),  # Move diagonally up and right to avoid the first obstacle
    (9.0, 7.24),  # Pass through the lower breakpoint of Set 1
    (13.0, 5.0),  # Navigate around the large central obstacle
    (16.0, 7.0),  # Continue moving right and slightly up
    (18.0, 10.0),  # Move upwards to avoid the top obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the green goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set
2. Ends within the goal set
3. Passes through one of the breakpoints (9.0, 7.24)
4. Avoids all obstacles by maintaining a safe distance
5. Uses arbitrary waypoints that aren't always parallel to an axis
6. Doesn't cross any obstacles

The path takes a somewhat curved route to avoid the obstacles, going under the large central obstacle and then curving up towards the goal. It maintains a safe distance from all obstacle edges to ensure no accidental crossings or touchings occur.

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 6 between points (18.0, 10.0) and (19.0, 19.0) intersects with obstacle(s):

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

[09/09/2024 09:29:02 PM] Thank you for providing the detailed information and feedback. I'll analyze the environment and suggest a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The current path intersects with Obstacle 4 in its final segment.
2. The valid subpath reaches (18.0, 10.0), which is close to the goal but needs careful navigation around the obstacles.
3. We need to pass through one of the breakpoints: (9.0, 7.24) or (9.0, 20.62). The current path uses (9.0, 7.24), which seems to be a good choice as it's lower and allows for more maneuvering room.
4. The space between Obstacles 1, 2, and 4 is quite constrained, requiring careful path planning.

Path Adjustment:
1. We'll keep the first part of the path up to (18.0, 10.0) as it's valid.
2. From (18.0, 10.0), we need to navigate around Obstacle 4 to reach the goal.
3. We'll add waypoints to curve around the bottom-right corner of Obstacle 4.
4. Finally, we'll approach the goal from the right side to avoid intersecting with any obstacles.

New path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (4.0, 3.0),    # Waypoint 1 (unchanged)
    (9.0, 7.24),   # Breakpoint (unchanged)
    (13.0, 5.0),   # Waypoint 2 (unchanged)
    (16.0, 7.0),   # Waypoint 3 (unchanged)
    (18.0, 10.0),  # Waypoint 4 (unchanged)
    (19.5, 11.5),  # New waypoint to start curving around Obstacle 4
    (19.8, 13.0),  # New waypoint to continue curving
    (20.0, 15.0),  # New waypoint to move upwards
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Final point in the goal set
]

Explanation of changes:
1. The path now curves around the bottom-right corner of Obstacle 4 by adding two new waypoints (19.5, 11.5) and (19.8, 13.0).
2. It then moves upwards to (20.0, 15.0) to clear the top edge of Obstacle 4.
3. Finally, it moves to (19.0, 19.0), which is within the goal set.

This new path should avoid all obstacles while still meeting the requirements of starting in the start set, ending in the goal set, and passing through the chosen breakpoint. The added waypoints ensure a smoother curve around Obstacle 4, maintaining a safe distance from its edges.
