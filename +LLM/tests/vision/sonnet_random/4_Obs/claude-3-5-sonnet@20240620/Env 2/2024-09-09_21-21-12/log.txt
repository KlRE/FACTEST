# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[17.8, 20.0], [11.9, 14.6], [14.3, 13.0], [16.2, 14.5]]
			Obstacle 2: [[17.5, 19.5], [5.5, 19.3], [9.2, 12.8], [9.6, 12.6]]
			Obstacle 3: [[7.3, 15.4], [8.3, 8.2], [11.4, 15.9], [9.9, 18.1]]
			Obstacle 4: [[15.3, 19.5], [17.3, 16.6], [17.4, 16.6], [17.4, 19.3]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 3.96), (9.0, 20.68)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/09/2024 09:21:17 PM] Based on the provided image and data, I'll propose a path that meets the requirements:

1. The path starts within the blue start set at the bottom left.
2. It avoids all red obstacle areas.
3. It passes through one of the breakpoints (9.0, 3.96).
4. It ends within the green goal set at the top right.

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start within the start set
    (4.0, 2.0),     # Move right and slightly up to avoid obstacles
    (9.0, 3.96),    # Pass through the required breakpoint
    (13.0, 8.0),    # Navigate between obstacles
    (16.0, 12.0),   # Continue moving up and right
    (18.5, 16.0),   # Approach the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End within the goal set
]

This path:
1. Begins in the start set at (1.0, 1.0)
2. Moves diagonally to avoid the lower obstacles
3. Passes through the required breakpoint at (9.0, 3.96)
4. Navigates between the obstacles, keeping a safe distance
5. Approaches the goal set from the left to avoid the uppermost obstacles
6. Ends within the goal set at (19.0, 19.0)

The path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles while meeting all the specified requirements. It uses arbitrary waypoints that are not always parallel to one axis, providing a smooth and efficient route through the environment.
