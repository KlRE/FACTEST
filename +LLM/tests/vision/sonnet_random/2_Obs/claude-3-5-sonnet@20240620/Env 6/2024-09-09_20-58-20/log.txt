# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[5.2, 6.1], [14.0, 9.4], [10.9, 12.2], [9.7, 11.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[15.7, 7.5], [17.8, 0.1], [18.1, 10.5], [16.2, 14.8]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 2.76), (9.0, 16.45)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[09/09/2024 08:58:26 PM] Based on the provided information and image, I'll create a path that meets the requirements. Let's analyze the environment:

1. The start set is a blue square in the bottom-left corner.
2. The goal set is a green square in the top-right corner.
3. There are two red obstacles: a quadrilateral in the center and an irregular shape on the right side.
4. There's a breakpoint set with two points: (9.0, 2.76) and (9.0, 16.45).

Considering these elements, here's a path that avoids obstacles, starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and passes through one of the breakpoints:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the blue square
    (5.0, 1.0),  # Move right to avoid the central obstacle
    (9.0, 2.76),  # Move to the lower breakpoint
    (9.0, 16.45),  # Move up to the higher breakpoint
    (15.0, 16.45),  # Move right, staying above the central obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the green square
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set.
2. Moves to the right to avoid the central obstacle.
3. Passes through both breakpoints (9.0, 2.76) and (9.0, 16.45).
4. Moves to the right, staying above the central obstacle and to the left of the right-side obstacle.
5. Ends within the goal set.

The path avoids all obstacles by maintaining a safe distance from them. It uses arbitrary waypoints that aren't always parallel to an axis, providing a more flexible route through the environment.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[09/09/2024 08:58:55 PM] Thank you for providing the detailed information about the path planning task and the feedback on the initial path. Let's analyze the situation and create a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the initial path were correct.
2. The path correctly passed through one of the breakpoints (9.0, 2.76).
3. The main issue is that the segment between (9.0, 2.76) and (9.0, 16.45) intersects with Obstacle 1.

Let's devise a new path that avoids this intersection:

1. We'll keep the initial segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (5.0, 1.0) to (9.0, 2.76), as it's valid.
2. Instead of going straight up from (9.0, 2.76), we need to go around Obstacle 1.
3. We can move to the right of Obstacle 1, then up, and then back to the left to reach (9.0, 16.45).
4. From there, we can proceed to the goal as before.

New path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point
    (5.0, 1.0),    # Intermediate point
    (9.0, 2.76),   # Breakpoint
    (14.5, 5.5),   # Move right to avoid Obstacle 1
    (14.5, 13.0),  # Move up, staying clear of Obstacle 2
    (9.0, 16.45),  # Move left to reach the second breakpoint
    (15.0, 16.45), # Intermediate point
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point in goal set
]

Explanation of changes:
1. The path starts at (1.0, 1.0) and moves to (5.0, 1.0) as before.
2. It reaches the first breakpoint at (9.0, 2.76).
3. Instead of going straight up, we now move to (14.5, 5.5), which is to the right of Obstacle 1.
4. We then move up to (14.5, 13.0), staying clear of both Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2.
5. From there, we move left to reach the second breakpoint at (9.0, 16.45).
6. Finally, we proceed to (15.0, 16.45) and end at (19.0, 19.0) in the goal set.

This new path should avoid intersecting with any obstacles while still meeting all the requirements of starting in the start set, ending in the goal set, and passing through one breakpoint from each set.
