# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[18.9, 14.3], [10.9, 13.2], [12.7, 1.9], [18.6, 12.1]]
			Obstacle 2: [[1.2, 16.1], [10.2, 15.4], [12.8, 17.5], [10.9, 17.5]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 6.74), (9.0, 19.61)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:

[09/09/2024 08:56:44 PM] Based on the provided information and the image, I'll describe a path that meets the requirements:

1. The path should start within the blue start set, which is in the bottom-left corner.
2. It needs to avoid the two red obstacle areas - one large triangular shape in the middle-right, and a smaller quadrilateral in the top-left.
3. The path must pass through one of the breakpoints at (9.0, 6.74) or (9.0, 19.61).
4. Finally, it should end within the green goal set in the top-right corner.

Considering these constraints, here's a suggested path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start within the blue start set
    (5.0, 5.0),     # Move diagonally up and right to avoid the first obstacle
    (9.0, 6.74),    # Pass through the lower breakpoint
    (15.0, 10.0),   # Navigate around the large triangular obstacle
    (18.5, 15.0),   # Move towards the goal while staying clear of obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End within the green goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the blue start set.
2. Avoids both red obstacle areas by giving them a wide berth.
3. Passes through the breakpoint at (9.0, 6.74).
4. Ends within the green goal set.
5. Uses arbitrary waypoints that aren't always parallel to an axis, allowing for more flexible navigation around obstacles.

The path takes a route that gives ample clearance to all obstacles, reducing the risk of any linear segments between waypoints intersecting with the obstacles. It also efficiently moves from start to goal while meeting all the specified requirements.

[09/09/2024 08:56:56 PM] Thank you for providing the detailed information and feedback. I'll analyze the situation and suggest a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The current path intersects with Obstacle 1 between points (9.0, 6.74) and (15.0, 10.0).
2. We need to adjust the path to go around Obstacle 1 while still passing through one of the breakpoints.
3. The breakpoint (9.0, 6.74) is already part of the valid subpath, so we'll keep that.
4. We need to find a way to navigate around Obstacle 1 to reach the goal set.

New path planning:
1. We'll keep the first three waypoints as they are valid: (1.0, 1.0), (5.0, 5.0), and (9.0, 6.74).
2. From (9.0, 6.74), we'll move upward to avoid Obstacle 1.
3. Then, we'll move rightward, staying above Obstacle 1.
4. Finally, we'll move towards the goal set.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 5.0),    # Second point (unchanged)
    (9.0, 6.74),   # Breakpoint (unchanged)
    (9.0, 14.0),   # Move upward to avoid Obstacle 1
    (15.0, 14.0),  # Move rightward, staying above Obstacle 1
    (18.0, 16.0),  # Move towards the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point in the goal set (unchanged)
]

Explanation of changes:
1. The path now goes up to y=14.0 after the breakpoint, which is above the highest point of Obstacle 1.
2. It then moves rightward at this height, safely passing over Obstacle 1.
3. The path then angles towards the goal set, avoiding Obstacle 2.
4. The final segment enters the goal set from a safe angle.

This new path should avoid intersecting with both obstacles while still meeting all the requirements:
- It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
- It passes through one of the required breakpoints (9.0, 6.74).
- It avoids intersecting with any obstacles.
- The path is represented as an array of waypoints that can be linearly connected.

This solution provides a clear path around the obstacles while maintaining the required structure and meeting all the given constraints.
