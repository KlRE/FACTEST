# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[14.3, 7.4], [17.4, 18.2], [15.8, 18.2], [15.6, 17.2]]
			Obstacle 2: [[12.7, 17.6], [8.1, 12.9], [10.3, 10.6], [12.2, 14.2]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 4.97), (9.0, 17.9)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[09/09/2024 09:04:33 PM] Based on the provided information and image, I'll create a path that meets the requirements:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start within the blue start set
    (5.0, 3.0),     # Move towards the goal while avoiding obstacles
    (9.0, 4.97),    # Pass through one of the breakpoints from Set 1
    (13.0, 10.0),   # Navigate around the obstacles
    (17.0, 15.0),   # Continue towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End within the green goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the blue start set at (1.0, 1.0)
2. Moves diagonally upward and to the right, avoiding the obstacles
3. Passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 4.97) from Breakpoint Set 1
4. Continues to navigate around the red obstacle areas
5. Ends within the green goal set at (19.0, 19.0)

The path avoids crossing or touching any of the red obstacle areas, maintaining a safe distance. It satisfies the requirement of passing through one of the breakpoints in the given set. The waypoints are chosen to create a smooth path that efficiently moves from the start to the goal while meeting all the specified conditions.

[09/09/2024 09:04:57 PM] Thank you for providing the detailed information about the path planning task. I'll analyze the current path and suggest improvements to avoid obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis of the current path:
The path starts correctly in the start set at (1.0, 1.0) and ends in the goal set at (19.0, 19.0). It also passes through one of the required breakpoints at (9.0, 4.97). However, the segment between (13.0, 10.0) and (17.0, 15.0) intersects with Obstacle 1.

Thought process for improvements:
1. We need to modify the path to avoid Obstacle 1 while maintaining a safe distance.
2. The valid subpath up to (13.0, 10.0) can be kept as it doesn't intersect with any obstacles.
3. To avoid Obstacle 1, we can add an intermediate point to go around its left side.
4. After passing Obstacle 1, we can adjust the path to reach the goal set.

Here's the proposed new path with explanations:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 3.0),    # Second point (unchanged)
    (9.0, 4.97),   # Breakpoint (unchanged)
    (13.0, 10.0),  # Last valid point before obstacle (unchanged)
    (13.5, 13.0),  # New point to avoid Obstacle 1 by going to its left
    (14.0, 16.0),  # Another new point to ensure we clear Obstacle 1
    (16.0, 18.0),  # Adjusting course towards the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point in the goal set (unchanged)
]

Explanation of changes:
1. The first four points remain the same as they form a valid subpath.
2. (13.5, 13.0) is added to start moving around the left side of Obstacle 1.
3. (14.0, 16.0) ensures we clear Obstacle 1 completely while maintaining a safe distance.
4. (16.0, 18.0) is added to adjust the course towards the goal set while avoiding Obstacle 2.
5. The final point (19.0, 19.0) remains unchanged as it's already in the goal set.

This new path should meet all the requirements:
- It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
- It passes through the required breakpoint (9.0, 4.97).
- It avoids both obstacles by maintaining a safe distance.
- The path is represented as an array of waypoints that can be linearly connected.

The adjusted path should now provide a collision-free route from the start to the goal while meeting all the specified criteria.

    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/09/2024 09:05:05 PM] Thank you for providing the detailed information and feedback on the previous path. Let's analyze the situation and create a new path that avoids the obstacles and meets all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The path starts correctly in the start set and reaches the breakpoint (9.0, 4.97) without issues.
2. The path encounters problems when trying to reach the goal set, specifically intersecting with Obstacle 1.
3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 1 while also avoiding Obstacle 2.

Let's adjust the path:

1. We'll keep the initial part of the path up to the breakpoint (9.0, 4.97) as it's valid.
2. After the breakpoint, we'll route the path to go around the left side of Obstacle 2, as there seems to be more space there.
3. Then, we'll guide the path above both obstacles before descending into the goal set.

New path explanation:
1. (1.0, 1.0) to (5.0, 3.0) to (9.0, 4.97): Keep these points as they form a valid subpath.
2. (9.0, 4.97) to (8.0, 8.0): Move upward to avoid Obstacle 2.
3. (8.0, 8.0) to (11.0, 11.0): Continue moving up and right, staying clear of Obstacle 2.
4. (11.0, 11.0) to (13.0, 15.0): Keep moving up and right, now positioning above both obstacles.
5. (13.0, 15.0) to (16.0, 19.0): Move towards the goal set while staying above Obstacle 1.
6. (16.0, 19.0) to (19.0, 19.0): Final approach into the goal set.

This path should avoid both obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (5.0, 3.0),
    (9.0, 4.97),
    (8.0, 8.0),
    (11.0, 11.0),
    (13.0, 15.0),
    (16.0, 19.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]

This new path starts in the start set, passes through the required breakpoint, avoids both obstacles by a safe margin, and ends in the goal set. The waypoints are chosen to create smooth transitions while maintaining a safe distance from the obstacles.
