# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[17.2, 15.9], [19.5, 11.3], [19.3, 13.7], [17.4, 18.1]]
			Obstacle 2: [[17.2, 13.6], [11.8, 3.6], [17.3, 2.0], [19.7, 2.7]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 10.0)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[09/09/2024 08:59:07 PM] Based on the provided information and image, I'll create a path that meets the requirements. Here's my analysis and proposed path:

1. The start set is a blue square in the bottom-left corner.
2. The goal set is a green square in the top-right corner.
3. There are two red obstacles: a quadrilateral in the middle-right and an irregular shape in the bottom-right.
4. There's a breakpoint at (9.0, 10.0) that the path must pass through.

The path should avoid the obstacles while connecting the start, breakpoint, and goal. Here's a suitable path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start within the blue start set
    (5.0, 5.0),     # Move diagonally up and right, avoiding obstacles
    (9.0, 10.0),    # Pass through the required breakpoint
    (14.0, 14.0),   # Continue diagonally up and right
    (17.0, 17.0),   # Adjust course to avoid the top-right obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End within the green goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the blue start set
2. Ends within the green goal set
3. Passes through the required breakpoint at (9.0, 10.0)
4. Avoids both red obstacles with a safe margin
5. Uses arbitrary waypoints that aren't always parallel to an axis
6. Provides a smooth and efficient route from start to goal

The path takes a diagonal approach to efficiently navigate the space, adjusting as needed to avoid obstacles and meet the breakpoint requirement. The final segment curves slightly to enter the goal set while maintaining a safe distance from the nearby obstacle.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[09/09/2024 08:59:16 PM] Thank you for providing the detailed information and feedback. I'll analyze the situation and suggest a new path that avoids the obstacle intersection.

Analyzing the environment:
1. The path was valid until the point (17.0, 17.0).
2. The last segment from (17.0, 17.0) to (19.0, 19.0) intersects with Obstacle 1.
3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 1 to reach the goal set.
4. The goal set is located at the top-right corner of the environment.
5. Obstacle 1 is positioned diagonally, creating a narrow passage between it and the top edge of the environment.

Adjusting the path:
1. We'll keep the valid part of the path up to (17.0, 17.0).
2. To avoid Obstacle 1, we'll add waypoints to go around its top-left corner.
3. We'll then navigate through the narrow passage above Obstacle 1 to reach the goal set.
4. The path still passes through the required breakpoint (9.0, 10.0).

Here's the new suggested path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 5.0),    # Intermediate point (unchanged)
    (9.0, 10.0),   # Breakpoint (unchanged)
    (14.0, 14.0),  # Intermediate point (unchanged)
    (17.0, 17.0),  # Last valid point from the previous path
    (17.0, 18.5),  # Move up to avoid Obstacle 1
    (18.0, 18.5),  # Move right, staying above Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point in the goal set
]

This new path should:
1. Start in the correct start set
2. End in the correct goal set
3. Pass through the required breakpoint (9.0, 10.0)
4. Avoid intersecting with both obstacles by going around the top-left corner of Obstacle 1
5. Maintain a safe distance from the obstacles

The adjustment made to the path focuses on the last two waypoints, where we added an additional point to navigate around Obstacle 1. This should resolve the intersection issue while still reaching the goal set efficiently.
