# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[11.4, 18.3], [10.0, 15.9], [10.3, 15.8], [11.8, 16.9]]
			Obstacle 2: [[4.8, 9.5], [9.0, 0.3], [10.5, 0.8], [7.3, 9.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, -0.85), (9.0, 13.32)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[09/09/2024 09:05:11 PM] Based on the provided information and image, I'll create a path that meets the requirements. Let's analyze the environment:

1. The start set is a blue square in the bottom-left corner.
2. The goal set is a green square in the top-right corner.
3. There are two red obstacles: a diagonal elongated shape in the bottom-right and a smaller shape in the top-right.
4. There's a breakpoint set with two points: (9.0, -0.85) and (9.0, 13.32).

Considering these elements, here's a suitable path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the blue start set
    (5.0, 5.0),  # Move diagonally to avoid the bottom-right obstacle
    (9.0, 13.32),  # Pass through one of the breakpoints
    (15.0, 17.0),  # Navigate around the top-right obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the green goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the blue start set.
2. Avoids both red obstacles by a safe margin.
3. Passes through one of the required breakpoints (9.0, 13.32).
4. Ends within the green goal set.
5. Uses arbitrary waypoints that aren't always parallel to an axis, allowing for diagonal movements.

The path first moves diagonally to avoid the large obstacle in the bottom-right, then goes through the required breakpoint. After that, it navigates around the smaller obstacle in the top-right before reaching the goal set. This route maintains a safe distance from all obstacles while meeting all the specified requirements.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[09/09/2024 09:05:19 PM] Thank you for providing the detailed information and feedback. Let's analyze the situation and create a new path that avoids the obstacles and meets all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The current path intersects with Obstacle 2 between points (5.0, 5.0) and (9.0, 13.32).
2. We need to avoid this intersection while still passing through one of the breakpoints: (9.0, -0.85) or (9.0, 13.32).
3. The breakpoint (9.0, 13.32) seems to be a better choice as it's closer to the goal and doesn't require going below the y-axis.
4. We need to find a way around Obstacle 2 to reach the breakpoint (9.0, 13.32).

Let's create a new path:

1. Start from the start set, keeping the first point (1.0, 1.0).
2. Instead of going directly towards the obstacle, let's move more to the left to avoid it.
3. We'll then curve around Obstacle 2 to reach the breakpoint (9.0, 13.32).
4. From there, we can proceed to the goal set.

New path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point in the start set
    (3.0, 4.0),    # Move up and slightly left to avoid Obstacle 2
    (2.5, 8.0),    # Continue moving up, staying left of Obstacle 2
    (4.0, 11.0),   # Start curving right, still avoiding Obstacle 2
    (9.0, 13.32),  # Reach the breakpoint
    (15.0, 17.0),  # Keep the existing point, which is valid
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point in the goal set
]

Explanation:
1. We start at (1.0, 1.0) in the start set.
2. The point (3.0, 4.0) helps us move upward while staying left of Obstacle 2.
3. (2.5, 8.0) continues this upward movement, ensuring we're well clear of Obstacle 2.
4. (4.0, 11.0) begins our curve to the right, still avoiding Obstacle 2.
5. We reach the breakpoint (9.0, 13.32) as required.
6. From there, we keep the existing valid points (15.0, 17.0) and (19.0, 19.0) to reach the goal set.

This path should avoid all obstacles while meeting all the requirements: starting in the start set, ending in the goal set, passing through a breakpoint, and not intersecting with any obstacles.
