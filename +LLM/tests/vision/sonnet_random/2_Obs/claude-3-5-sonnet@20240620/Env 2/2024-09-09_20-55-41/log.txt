# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[10.4, 13.8], [14.7, 9.7], [20.0, 13.3], [10.5, 15.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[17.6, 6.4], [19.4, 6.3], [19.0, 8.1], [18.3, 11.1]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 10.0)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

[09/09/2024 08:55:47 PM] Based on the provided information and image, I'll plan a path that meets the requirements. Let's analyze the environment:

1. The start set is a blue square in the bottom-left corner.
2. The goal set is a green square in the top-right corner.
3. There are two red obstacles: a triangular one in the upper-right area and a small rectangular one below it.
4. There's a breakpoint at (9.0, 10.0) that the path must pass through.

Here's a suitable path that avoids obstacles, starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and passes through the required breakpoint:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (5.0, 5.0),    # Move diagonally up and right
    (9.0, 10.0),   # Pass through the required breakpoint
    (15.0, 15.0),  # Move diagonally up and right, avoiding the obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the blue start set at (1.0, 1.0).
2. Moves diagonally up and right to (5.0, 5.0), staying clear of any obstacles.
3. Continues to the required breakpoint at (9.0, 10.0).
4. Then moves to (15.0, 15.0), which keeps it well clear of both red obstacles.
5. Finally ends within the green goal set at (19.0, 19.0).

The path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles and uses diagonal movements to efficiently navigate the space. It satisfies all the given requirements by starting and ending in the correct sets, passing through the breakpoint, and avoiding obstacles.

[09/09/2024 08:55:57 PM] Thank you for providing the detailed information about the path planning task and the feedback on the previously generated path. I'll analyze the situation and suggest a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the previous path were correct.
2. The path successfully passed through the required breakpoint (9.0, 10.0).
3. The issue occurred in the segment between (9.0, 10.0) and (15.0, 15.0), which intersected with Obstacle 1.

To correct this, we need to adjust the path to go around Obstacle 1 while still reaching the goal. Let's plan a new path:

1. We'll keep the first three waypoints as they are valid: (1.0, 1.0), (5.0, 5.0), and (9.0, 10.0).
2. From (9.0, 10.0), we need to avoid Obstacle 1. Looking at the obstacle's coordinates, we can see that it extends further to the left than to the right.
3. To avoid the obstacle, we'll add a waypoint to go around its right side, keeping a safe distance.
4. After passing the obstacle, we can then proceed to the goal area.

New path suggestion:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 5.0),    # Intermediate point (unchanged)
    (9.0, 10.0),   # Breakpoint (unchanged)
    (16.0, 11.0),  # New point to avoid Obstacle 1 (right side)
    (18.0, 15.0),  # New intermediate point
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point in goal area (unchanged)
]

Explanation of the new waypoints:
- (16.0, 11.0): This point is chosen to safely pass to the right of Obstacle 1. It's positioned to maintain distance from the obstacle's rightmost vertex (20.0, 13.3).
- (18.0, 15.0): This intermediate point helps create a smoother path towards the goal area while still avoiding Obstacle 2.

This new path should:
1. Start in the correct start set
2. Pass through the required breakpoint (9.0, 10.0)
3. Avoid intersecting with both obstacles
4. End in the correct goal set

The path now takes a slight detour to the right to avoid Obstacle 1, then curves back towards the goal area. This should resolve the intersection issue while maintaining all other requirements of the task.

[09/09/2024 08:56:05 PM] Thank you for providing the detailed information and feedback. I'll analyze the situation and suggest a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The current path intersects with Obstacle 1 between points (9.0, 10.0) and (16.0, 11.0).
2. The valid subpath ends at (9.0, 10.0), which is also a breakpoint, so we can continue from there.
3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 1 to reach the goal set.
4. There appears to be a gap between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2 that we can use.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Keep the first three waypoints as they are valid: (1.0, 1.0), (5.0, 5.0), (9.0, 10.0).
2. From (9.0, 10.0), we need to move upwards to avoid Obstacle 1.
3. Then, we can move towards the right, staying above Obstacle 1 but below Obstacle 2.
4. Once we're past Obstacle 1, we can move towards the goal set.

Here's the suggested new path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 5.0),    # Second point (unchanged)
    (9.0, 10.0),   # Breakpoint (unchanged)
    (10.0, 15.5),  # Move upwards to avoid Obstacle 1
    (15.0, 15.5),  # Move right, staying above Obstacle 1 and below Obstacle 2
    (17.0, 14.0),  # Start moving towards the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point in the goal set (unchanged)
]

This new path should:
1. Start in the correct start set
2. End in the correct goal set
3. Pass through the required breakpoint (9.0, 10.0)
4. Avoid intersecting with both obstacles
5. Maintain a safe distance from the obstacles
