# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[13.8, 19.6], [12.0, 16.1], [12.9, 15.9], [16.2, 17.1]]
			Obstacle 2: [[17.0, 16.5], [16.6, 10.9], [17.1, 11.3], [18.5, 16.4]]
			Obstacle 3: [[2.0, 16.1], [10.1, 15.2], [12.2, 19.3], [8.5, 18.8]]
			Obstacle 4: [[8.0, 14.0], [12.3, 13.6], [10.5, 19.6], [8.1, 16.8]]
			Obstacle 5: [[16.0, 14.0], [15.3, 11.2], [17.7, 11.5], [18.3, 12.1]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/09/2024 02:07:05 PM] To create a path from the start set to the goal set while avoiding obstacles, we can consider the spatial layout and find a sequence of waypoints that navigates around the obstacles. Here's a potential path plan:

### Path Plan:
1. **Start Point:** Select a point from the start set, such as (1.0, 1.0).
2. **Intermediate Points:** Carefully navigate around the obstacles, ensuring no crossing.
3. **End Point:** End at a point in the goal set, such as (19.0, 19.0).

### New Path:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start point within the start set
    (5.0, 2.0),      # Move right and slightly up to avoid lower left obstacle
    (6.0, 10.0),     # Navigate upward safely avoiding direct obstacle paths
    (8.0, 12.0),     # Continue moving up and slightly to the right
    (14.0, 14.0),    # Shift further right to clear the central obstacles
    (17.0, 17.0),    # Move near goal set while avoiding touching obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)     # Final point within the goal set
]
```

### Explanation:
- **(1.0, 1.0) to (5.0, 2.0):** This segment will avoid the central mass of obstacles on the left.
- **(5.0, 2.0) to (6.0, 10.0):** A vertical and safe upward move to pass clear from left side obstacles.
- **(6.0, 10.0) to (8.0, 12.0):** Gradually veer rightward to ensure a safe trajectory.
- **(8.0, 12.0) to (14.0, 14.0):** Navigates around the bulk of central obstacles.
- **(14.0, 14.0) to (17.0, 17.0):** Prepares entry into the goal area through open space.
- **Ends at (19.0, 19.0):** Safely arrives in the designated goal area. 

Ensure each segment keeps a safe distance around obstacles to prevent any unplanned intersection.
