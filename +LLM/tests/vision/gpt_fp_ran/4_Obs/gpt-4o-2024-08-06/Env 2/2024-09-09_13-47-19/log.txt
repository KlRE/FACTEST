# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[17.8, 20.0], [11.9, 14.6], [14.3, 13.0], [16.2, 14.5]]
			Obstacle 2: [[17.5, 19.5], [5.5, 19.3], [9.2, 12.8], [9.6, 12.6]]
			Obstacle 3: [[7.3, 15.4], [8.3, 8.2], [11.4, 15.9], [9.9, 18.1]]
			Obstacle 4: [[15.3, 19.5], [17.3, 16.6], [17.4, 16.6], [17.4, 19.3]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/09/2024 01:47:25 PM] To construct a path from the start set to the goal set while avoiding obstacles, we need to carefully analyze the positions of the quadrilateral obstacles and find a clear path between them.

Here's a potential path:

1. **Start Point**: Begin inside the start quadrilateral, for instance at (1.0, 1.0).
2. **Waypoint 1**: Move rightward to avoid the first obstacle, for instance to (5.0, 2.0).
3. **Waypoint 2**: Head toward (10.0, 2.0), staying below obstacles 2 and 3.
4. **Waypoint 3**: Continue to (15.0, 5.0), moving diagonally upward while avoiding all obstacles.
5. **Waypoint 4**: Approach the goal area at (18.5, 18.5), staying clear of obstacle 4.
6. **End Point**: End at (19.0, 19.0) within the goal quadrilateral.

The final path would look like this:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start in the start set
    (5.0, 2.0),   # Navigate right
    (10.0, 2.0),  # Move straight across, staying below obstacles
    (15.0, 5.0),  # Veer upward diagonally to avoid obstacles
    (18.5, 18.5), # Move toward the goal quadrant
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End in the goal set
]
```

This path ensures that the line segments do not cross the defined obstacles, keeping a safe distance from them.
