# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[13.9, 17.7], [10.7, 17.7], [11.7, 15.1], [13.8, 15.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[16.2, 18.7], [15.9, 13.1], [16.2, 12.1], [17.4, 15.4]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/09/2024 01:27:23 PM] To plan a path that avoids the obstacles while moving from the start area to the goal area, here's a step-by-step analysis and solution:

### Analysis:

1. **Start Area**: Located in the lower left corner of the environment, from (2.0, 2.0) to (0, 0).
2. **Goal Area**: Located near the top right, at coordinates around (18.0, 18.0) to (20.0, 20.0).
3. **Obstacles Analysis**:
   - **Obstacle 1** is positioned from approximately x=10.7 to 13.9 and y=15.1 to 17.7.
   - **Obstacle 2** is situated from approximately x=15.9 to 17.4 and y=12.1 to 18.7.

### Path Planning:

Given these conditions, we'll start near the bottom left, navigate around the bottom of the obstacles, and approach the goal area from below:

1. **Start Point**: Choose a point near the center of the start area.
2. **Route Choice**: Navigate around the bottom of Obstacle 2 and into the goal area from beneath.

### Proposed Path:

Here's a potential path with waypoints that avoids the obstacles:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (5.0, 1.0),    # Move right
    (15.0, 1.0),   # Continue right past both obstacles
    (17.0, 12.0),  # Move up just below the goal area, avoiding Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Enter the goal area from below
]
```

### Path Details:

- **(1.0, 1.0)**: Start within the starting area.
- **(5.0, 1.0) & (15.0, 1.0)**: Safely move along the bottom, avoiding the obstacles.
- **(17.0, 12.0)**: Navigate upwards safely between the obstacles' clearance.
- **(19.0, 19.0)**: End within the goal set.

Care is taken to ensure the path remains clear of obstacles by maintaining sufficient distance and using safe vertical and horizontal traversal to the goal.
