# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[12.5, 16.7], [14.3, 16.3], [17.4, 18.8], [14.1, 17.9]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/09/2024 01:20:17 PM] To create a path from the start set to the goal set while avoiding the obstacle, we need to strategically choose waypoints that do not intersect with the obstacle defined in your scenario.

### Analysis
1. **Start Position**: A suitable starting point might be (1.0, 1.0), near the center of the start quadrilateral.
2. **Goal Position**: A good ending point could be (19.0, 19.0), near the center of the goal quadrilateral.
3. **Obstacle Consideration**: The obstacle is between (12.5, 16.7) and (17.4, 18.8). We need to plan a path that stays clear of this area.

### Proposed Path
1. **From Start to First Waypoint**: Move diagonally upward-right from (1.0, 1.0) to (10.0, 10.0), staying clear of the obstacle.
2. **From First to Second Waypoint**: Adjust direction to (16.0, 15.0) to circumvent the lower edge of the obstacle.
3. **Final Stretch to Goal**: Finally, move to (19.0, 19.0) to reach the goal set safely.

### Final Path as Waypoints
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start point
    (10.0, 10.0), # Adjusting direction up and right
    (16.0, 15.0), # Move above the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End point within the goal set
]
```
This path ensures we avoid the obstacle completely by taking a wider arc around it.
[09/09/2024 01:20:17 PM] Parsed response: [(1.0, 1.0), (10.0, 10.0), (16.0, 15.0), (19.0, 19.0)]
