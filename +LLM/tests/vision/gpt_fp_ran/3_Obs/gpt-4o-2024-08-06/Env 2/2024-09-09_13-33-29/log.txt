# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[0.9, 18.5], [-0.0, 7.5], [5.8, 10.7], [9.8, 18.1]]
			Obstacle 2: [[13.0, 18.2], [6.8, 15.3], [8.9, 15.2], [11.7, 16.1]]
			Obstacle 3: [[12.5, 8.3], [15.3, 5.5], [15.7, 14.9], [14.9, 16.1]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/09/2024 01:33:34 PM] To plan the path from the start set to the goal set while avoiding obstacles, we need to carefully analyze the given space and ensure that the path does not cross any obstacles. Hereâ€™s a possible path:

### Path Analysis:
1. **Start Point Selection:** Choose a point inside the start quadrilateral, e.g., (1.0, 1.0).
2. **End Point Selection:** Choose a point inside the goal quadrilateral, e.g., (19.0, 19.0).
3. **Obstacle Avoidance:** Navigate around the obstacles by choosing waypoints that avoid intersecting the quadrilaterals.

### Planned Path:

- Start at (1.0, 1.0) inside the start set.
- Move to (1.0, 5.0) to avoid the first obstacle.
- Navigate to (7.0, 12.0) moving around the obstacles while keeping a safe distance.
- Continue to (15.0, 17.0), bypassing the third obstacle.
- Finish at (19.0, 19.0), reaching the goal set.

### New Path:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start in the start set
    (1.0, 5.0),  # Move upwards to avoid the first obstacle
    (7.0, 12.0), # Navigate around the second obstacle
    (15.0, 17.0),# Bypass the third obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0) # End in the goal set
]
```

This path ensures all conditions are met: starting and ending within respective sets and avoiding any intersection with obstacles.
