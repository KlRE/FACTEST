# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 0.56), (5.12, 9.43)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(2.0, 1.75), (5.12, 0.56), (6.0, 1.75), (9.0, 8.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.

    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

[09/05/2024 07:44:34 PM] The previous path goes too far to the right and then tries to cross the obstacle diagonally. 

A better approach would be to hug the left edge of the obstacle and then move towards the goal from there.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.75),  # Start point
    (5.12, 0.56), # Breakpoint
    (5.12, 5.0),  # Move up along the left edge of the obstacle 
    (9.0, 5.0), # Move right, staying clear of the obstacle's top corner
    (9.0, 8.5)   # Arrive at the goal 
]
```

This path avoids the obstacle by moving vertically up to the same y-coordinate as the obstacle's top left vertex, then moving right to clear the obstacle, and finally moving up to the goal.
