# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -1.58), (2.0, 1.72)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(-0.0, -0.0), (0.0, -2.0), (2.0, -1.58), (2.5, 0.0), (3.46, 2.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Incorrect, The path does not end inside the goal set [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]].
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 1 between points (-0.0, -0.0) and (0.0, -2.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(-0.0, -0.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Goal Position: End within the specified rectangular goal set.
Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate

[09/05/2024 07:55:39 PM] The initial segment of the path immediately crosses Obstacle 2. To correct this, we can utilize the first breakpoint (2.0, -1.58) to circumvent the obstacle. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0),  # Starting point
    (2.0, -1.58), # Breakpoint 1 to avoid Obstacle 2
    (2.5, 1.0),  # Approaching Breakpoint Set 1
    (2.0, 1.72),  # Breakpoint Set 1 
    (2.5, 2.5),  # Continue towards the goal
    (3.46, 3.0)   # End point within the goal set
]
```

This path first moves towards Breakpoint 1 to avoid the initial collision with Obstacle 2. It then proceeds towards Breakpoint Set 1, passes through a valid breakpoint, and finally reaches the goal set.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -1.58), (2.0, 1.72)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.0, 0.0), (2.0, -1.58), (2.5, 1.0), (2.0, 1.72), (2.5, 2.5), (3.46, 3.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 1 between points (0.0, 0.0) and (2.0, -1.58) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.0, 0.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

[09/05/2024 07:55:57 PM] The initial path selection was too direct and intersected with Obstacle 2. To correct this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle. One way to do this is to move leftwards, staying clear of Obstacle 2, before proceeding to the goal.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -1.58), (2.0, 1.72)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.0, 0.5), (-1.0, 0.5), (-1.0, -1.58), (2.0, -1.58), (2.5, 0.0), (3.0, 2.0), (3.46, 3.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 2 between points (-1.0, 0.5) and (-1.0, -1.58) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.0, 0.5), (-1.0, 0.5)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]

Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]

[09/05/2024 07:56:40 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 2. Since the provided valid subpath ends at (-1.0, -0.5), which is already quite close to the breakpoint (2.0, -1.58), we can try to connect them directly. From there, maneuvering around the obstacles to reach the goal becomes easier. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.5),  # Starting inside the start set 
    (-1.0, 0.5), # First waypoint from the valid subpath
    (-1.0, -0.5), # Second waypoint from the valid subpath
    (2.0, -1.58), # First breakpoint
    (2.5, -1.58), # Move slightly right to avoid any potential corner of Obstacle 2
    (2.5, 2.0),  # Move upwards to bypass Obstacle 2
    (3.46, 3.0)   # Connect to the goal set 
]
```

This path addresses the collision issue while fulfilling the requirement of passing through breakpoints and reaching the goal.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -1.58), (2.0, 1.72)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.0, 0.5), (-1.0, 0.5), (-1.0, -0.5), (2.0, -1.58), (2.5, -1.58), (2.5, 2.0), (3.46, 3.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 3 between points (-1.0, -0.5) and (2.0, -1.58) intersects with obstacle(s):

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.0, 0.5), (-1.0, 0.5), (-1.0, -0.5)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

[09/05/2024 07:56:48 PM] The current path fails because it tries to cross obstacle 2 diagonally. To circumvent this, we can utilize the breakpoint (2.0, -1.58) and navigate around the obstacle.

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Start:** Keep the initial segment of the path, as it lies within the start set: [(0.0, 0.5), (-1.0, 0.5)].

2. **Navigate Downwards:** Instead of moving directly towards the breakpoint,  guide the path downwards, staying clear of obstacle 2. A possible waypoint could be (-1.0, -1.5).

3. **Reach Breakpoint:** Now, connect to the breakpoint: (-1.0, -1.5), (2.0, -1.58).

4. **Proceed Towards Goal:** From the breakpoint, the path can safely navigate upwards to the goal set, avoiding any obstacles. Example waypoints: (2.5, -1.58), (2.5, 2.0), (3.46, 3.0).

Therefore, a revised path could be:

```
new_path = [(0.0, 0.5), (-1.0, 0.5), (-1.0, -1.5), (2.0, -1.58), (2.5, -1.58), (2.5, 2.0), (3.46, 3.0)]
```

This new path avoids crossing any obstacles and successfully connects the start and goal sets while passing through a breakpoint.

2. **Avoiding Obstacle 2:**  Instead of moving horizontally, we need to navigate above Obstacle 2.
3. **Utilizing Breakpoint:** We can aim for the upper breakpoint of Breakpoint Set 1, which is (2.0, 1.72).
4. **Reaching the Goal:** From the breakpoint, we can move directly to a point within the goal set.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.5),   // Start Point
    (1.0, 1.5),   // Navigate above Obstacle 2
    (2.0, 1.72),  // Reach the upper breakpoint 
    (3.46, 2.87) // End Point within the goal set
]
```
