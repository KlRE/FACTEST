# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.37, 1.37), (2.0, 1.72), (3.5, 2.87)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Incorrect, The path does not start in the correct start set [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]].

		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:

    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

[09/05/2024 08:03:11 PM] The initial path failed because it started outside of the designated starting area and intersected with obstacle 1.  To correct this, the path needs to originate within the blue quadrilateral and navigate around the obstacles to reach the goal.

Analyzing the image, a viable route emerges. Starting from within the blue quadrilateral, the path can progress downward, passing beneath obstacle 2.  It can then proceed towards the right, utilizing the space between the lower left corner of obstacle 1 and the lower right corner of obstacle 2.  Once clear of the obstacles, the path can then ascend upwards, passing through the designated breakpoint and finally reaching the goal within the green quadrilateral.

Here is a possible path based on this strategy:

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0),  # Start within the start set
    (0.0, -1.0), # Move downwards to avoid obstacle 2
    (2.0, -1.58), # Pass through breakpoint 1
    (3.0, 0.0),  # Navigate between obstacles 1 and 2
    (3.5, 2.87)  # Reach the goal within the goal set
]

[09/05/2024 08:03:28 PM] The initial path goes directly downwards from the start point, causing it to intersect with Obstacle 2. To circumvent this, we should navigate the path around the left corner of Obstacle 2. This can be achieved by adding a waypoint to the left and below Obstacle 2. From there, we can pass through the chosen breakpoint and continue towards the goal set.

Here's the adjusted path:

    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.0, 0.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -1.58), (2.0, 1.72)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.0, 0.0), (0.5, 0.8), (1.5, 1.2), (2.0, 1.72), (2.5, 2.2), (3.5, 2.87)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 1 between points (0.0, 0.0) and (0.5, 0.8) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.0, 0.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[09/05/2024 08:04:08 PM] The initial segment of the path immediately intersects with Obstacle 2. To circumvent this, we need a path that goes around this obstacle. 

First, we should navigate towards the right side of Obstacle 2. Once we are past this obstacle, we can proceed towards the goal set.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0),   # Start Point
    (1.0, 0.5),   # Navigate around the bottom-left corner of Obstacle 2
    (2.0, -1.58),  # Reach Breakpoint Set 1
    (3.0, 0.0),    # Move towards the right side of Obstacle 2
    (4.0, 1.0),    # Continue moving towards the goal set
    (3.46, 2.0)   # End Point within the goal set
]
```

This new path avoids Obstacle 2 by going around its bottom and right sides, ensuring no intersections. It also passes through a breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1 before reaching the goal set.

**Explanation:**

1. **(0.0, 0.0):** Start within the start set.
2. **(0.5, 0.0):** Move slightly to the right to avoid the corner of obstacle 2.
3. **(0.5, -2.0):** Move downwards, staying clear of the left edge of obstacle 2.
4. **(2.0, -1.58):**  Pass through the breakpoint while still moving right and upwards, ensuring a safe distance from obstacle 2. 
5. **(3.0, -1.5):** Continue moving right and slightly upwards, preparing to navigate towards the goal set.

[09/05/2024 08:04:28 PM] The previous path attempt failed right at the start due to colliding with Obstacle 2. It's clear we need a path that goes above obstacle 2 to be viable. We also need to reach the goal, which is above Obstacle 2 as well.  Let's aim for a path that goes above and to the right, leveraging the breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.5),    # Start within the start set.
    (0.5, 1.5),    # Move upwards to avoid Obstacle 2. 
    (2.0, 1.72),   # Pass through the upper breakpoint of Breakpoint Set 1.
    (3.0, 2.0),    # Angle slightly downwards to approach the goal.
    (3.46, 2.5)    # End within the goal set. 
]
```

This path attempts to navigate around the obstacle by first moving upwards, then using the breakpoint as a guide to navigate towards the goal. It's important to visually verify this path against the provided image to ensure it doesn't intersect with any obstacles.

## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -1.58), (2.0, 1.72)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.0, 0.5), (0.5, 1.5), (2.0, 1.72), (3.0, 2.0), (3.46, 2.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 1 between points (0.0, 0.5) and (0.5, 1.5) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.0, 0.5)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

[09/05/2024 08:04:33 PM] The initial path segment crosses obstacle 1. To circumvent this, we can route the path below obstacle 1.  We can accomplish this by passing through the breakpoint (2.0, -1.58). From there, we can move towards the goal set.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0),   # Start within the start set
    (1.0, -0.5),  # Move towards the breakpoint while staying clear of obstacle 1
    (2.0, -1.58), # Pass through the breakpoint

[09/05/2024 08:04:40 PM] The initial path went downwards directly into Obstacle 2. The path needs to navigate around this obstacle to reach the goal. The space between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2 seems fairly tight, so it might be easier to go around Obstacle 2 entirely.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0),    # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 0.87),   # Move slightly up and right, staying within the start set 
    (2.0, 1.72),   # Pass through the top breakpoint of Breakpoint Set 1
    (2.5, 2.5),   # Move upward, towards the goal set while avoiding Obstacle 2
    (3.46, 2.5)    # Move right to end within the goal set 
] 
```

This path first moves slightly up and to the right to avoid the initial collision with Obstacle 2.  It then uses the top breakpoint of Breakpoint Set 1 as a guide to navigate around Obstacle 2. Finally, it heads towards the goal set.

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.0, 0.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.

[09/05/2024 08:04:55 PM] The initial segment of the path crosses obstacle 2. To avoid this, we can route the path below obstacle 2. 

The breakpoint (2.0, -1.58) seems like a good candidate to pass through, as it will allow for a clear path under obstacle 2. From there, we can head towards the goal set.

Here's the adjusted path:

[09/05/2024 08:05:57 PM] The path goes straight up, colliding with both obstacles. It's necessary to navigate around these obstacles. One approach is to utilize the provided breakpoint (2.0, 1.72), as it sits within a clear area between the obstacles.

Here's a possible path adjustment:

1. **Start:** (0.0, 0.0) - Remains inside the start set.
2. **Navigate Right:** (1.5, 0.8) -  Move slightly right while maintaining a safe distance from Obstacle 2.
3. **Approach Breakpoint:** (1.8, 1.5) - Position for a smooth transition to the breakpoint. 
4. **Breakpoint:** (2.0, 1.72) - Utilize the provided breakpoint.

[09/05/2024 08:06:04 PM] The first segment of the path immediately intersects with Obstacle 2. To avoid this, the path needs to first navigate below Obstacle 2. 

We can achieve this by first moving to the left, going below Obstacle 2, and then upwards towards the goal:

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0),  # Start point
    (-1.0, -1.0), # Move down and to the left, below Obstacle 2
    (2.0, -1.58), # Navigate to the first breakpoint
    (3.0, 2.0),  # Move upwards towards the goal, ensuring clear passage
    (3.46, 2.5)   # End point within the goal set 
]
```

This adjusted path ensures the following:

* **Obstacle Avoidance:** The path now goes around Obstacle 2, avoiding any intersection.
* **Breakpoint Usage:** The path utilizes the first breakpoint (2.0, -1.58).
* **Start and End within Sets:**  The path starts and ends within the designated start and goal sets.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -1.58), (2.0, 1.72)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.0, 0.0), (-1.0, -1.0), (2.0, -1.58), (3.0, 2.0), (3.46, 2.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 1 between points (0.0, 0.0) and (-1.0, -1.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.0, 0.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

[09/05/2024 08:06:09 PM] The initial segment of the path crosses obstacle 2. To circumvent this, we can adjust the path to go around the obstacle. 

Instead of going directly to (-1.0, -1.0), let's navigate below obstacle 2. We can achieve this by adding a waypoint at (1.0, -2.0) and then connecting to the breakpoint (2.0, -1.58). This will ensure we avoid the obstacle entirely.

From there, we can maintain the rest of the original path as it successfully reaches the goal set without encountering any further obstacles. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [(0.0, 0.0), (1.0, -2.0), (2.0, -1.58), (3.0, 2.0), (3.46, 2.5)] 
```
