# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data

[09/05/2024 09:48:57 PM] The first segment of the path immediately intersects with Obstacle 8. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around obstacles to reach the breakpoint (3.4, 2.95).

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.6, 3.5),   # Start within the start set
    (1.5, 3.5),   # Move right, staying clear of Obstacle 3 
    (1.5, 2.45),  # Move down, staying clear of Obstacles 4 and 5
    (3.4, 2.45),  # Move right towards the breakpoint
    (3.4, 2.95),  # Reach the first breakpoint 
    (6.5, 2.95),  # Move right, clear of obstacles
    (6.5, 4.75)   # Move up to the goal set 
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles, utilizes the required breakpoint, and reaches the goal set.

[09/05/2024 09:49:15 PM] The initial path attempts to navigate to the breakpoint (3.4, 2.95) directly, leading to a collision with obstacle 4. To avoid this, we can adjust the path to move around obstacle 4 by going down at x = 1.5 to y = 2.45. Then, we need to navigate around obstacle 6. We can achieve this by moving to the right at y = 2.45 until we clear obstacle 6, and then move up to the desired breakpoint. 

Here's the adjusted path:

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.6, 3.6], [0.4, 3.6], [0.4, 3.4], [0.6, 3.4]]

			Obstacle 11: [[6.0, 2.0], [5.0, 2.0], [5.0, 1.9], [6.0, 1.9]]
			Obstacle 12: [[6.0, 5.0], [5.9, 5.0], [5.9, 2.0], [6.0, 2.0]]
			Obstacle 13: [[5.0, 1.0], [4.9, 1.0], [4.9, -0.0], [5.0, -0.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(3.4, 1.0), (3.4, 2.95), (3.4, 4.45)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.6, 3.5), (1.5, 3.5), (1.5, 2.45), (4.1, 2.45), (4.1, 2.95), (6.5, 2.95), (6.5, 4.75)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 2 between points (1.5, 3.5) and (1.5, 2.45) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 4: [[2.0, 3.0], [1.0, 3.0], [1.0, 2.9], [2.0, 2.9]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.6, 3.5), (1.5, 3.5)]
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Missing breakpoint sets:
 		Breakpoint Set 1: [(3.4, 1.0), (3.4, 2.95), (3.4, 4.45)]
	

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

1. **Go South:** From the last valid waypoint (3.4, 2.95), the path is redirected downwards (south) to the breakpoint (3.4, 1.0). This maneuver steers clear of Obstacle 7.
2. **Move East:** Once reaching (3.4, 1.0), the path proceeds safely eastward to (4.5, 1.0), remaining below Obstacle 7. 
3. **Continue Original Path:**  From (4.5, 1.0) the path can then resume the original trajectory towards the goal, going through (4.5, 4.75) and finally reaching (6.5, 4.75).

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.

    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
