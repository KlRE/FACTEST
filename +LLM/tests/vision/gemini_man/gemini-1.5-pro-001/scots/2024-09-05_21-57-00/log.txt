# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]

[09/05/2024 09:57:36 PM] The initial path crosses multiple obstacles. To fix this, the path can be adjusted to go above the obstacles:

1. **Starting Point:** (0.5, 0.5) - This is a valid starting point within the start set.

2. **Navigate Upwards:** Since the first breakpoint is horizontally aligned with obstacles, move upwards to (0.5, 9.5) to avoid all obstacles.

3. **Breakpoint:** (4.8, 9.5) -  Move towards the right and pass through the breakpoint.

4. **Goal Approach:** Continue moving right to (9.5, 9.5), staying above all obstacles. 

5. **Goal Point:** Finally, move down to (9.5, 0.6) to reach a valid point within the goal set.

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

[09/05/2024 09:57:54 PM] The current path fails because it intersects with several obstacles. To create a successful path, we need to navigate around these obstacles. 

First, we can travel to the provided breakpoint at (4.8, 0.5). However, we need to avoid colliding with obstacles along the way. 

Let's analyze the layout:
 - Obstacles 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8 form a barrier preventing us from moving directly right from the start. 
 - There's a gap between Obstacles 1 and 2, and another between Obstacles 2 and 4. 

Here's a possible path adjustment:

1. **Start:** (0.5, 0.5) 
2. **Navigate Upwards:** (0.5, 5.25) -  Move upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 1.
3. **Move Right:** (4.8, 5.25) - Travel right above the obstacles, using the space between Obstacles 3 and 7.
4. **Descend to Breakpoint:** (4.8, 0.5) - Move down to the breakpoint, avoiding Obstacle 5. 
5. **Proceed Right:** (9.5, 0.5) - Continue moving right, passing beneath Obstacle 9 towards the goal. 

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (0.5, 5.25),
    (4.8, 5.25),

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.

[09/05/2024 09:58:00 PM] The current path collides with Obstacles 1, 4, and 5 because it attempts to move horizontally at a y-coordinate of 5.25. To avoid these obstacles, the path needs to navigate below them. 

A better approach is to use the breakpoint (4.8, 0.5) and plan the path as follows:

1. **Start:** (0.5, 0.5) - Starting within the start set.
2. **Breakpoint:** (4.8, 0.5) - Moving horizontally to the breakpoint, staying below all obstacles.
3. **Goal:** (9.5, 0.5) -  Continuing horizontally to the goal set.

This path stays consistently below all obstacles, ensuring a collision-free path.

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (4.8, 0.5), (9.5, 0.5)] 
```

[09/05/2024 09:58:27 PM] The initial path fails as it attempts to pass directly through obstacles 1, 2, and 4. A more feasible route involves navigating above these obstacles and then proceeding right towards the goal.

Here's a revised path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 9.25),    # Move above all obstacles 
    (4.8, 9.25),    # Move right, passing the breakpoint
    (9.5, 9.25),    # Continue right towards the goal
    (9.5, 0.5)     # Move down into the goal set 
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles by moving above them initially and then proceeding right towards the goal, ensuring a collision-free trajectory.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data

			Obstacle 8: [[7.2, 10.0], [7.0, 10.0], [7.0, 1.0], [7.2, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 9: [[8.4, 8.5], [8.2, 8.5], [8.2, -0.0], [8.4, -0.0]]

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

[09/05/2024 09:58:38 PM] The first segment of the path immediately intersects with Obstacle 1. Thus, the path needs to be adjusted to avoid this obstacle. We can achieve this by first navigating upwards, clearing the obstacles clustered around x-coordinates 1 to 4, and then moving right towards the goal set. Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 5.5),    # Move upwards to avoid Obstacle 1
    (4.8, 5.5),    # Move right, passing through Breakpoint Set 1
    (4.8, 0.5),    # Move downwards, clearing the obstacles
    (9.5, 0.5)     # Move right towards a point within the goal set
]
```

This path addresses the obstacle collision and strategically uses the breakpoint to navigate through the environment.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

[09/05/2024 09:58:49 PM] The current path collides with multiple obstacles. To circumvent this, we can leverage the provided breakpoint at (4.8, 0.5).

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.7, 0.7], [0.3, 0.7], [0.3, 0.3], [0.7, 0.3]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.2, 9.0], [1.0, 9.0], [1.0, -0.0], [1.2, -0.0]]

			Obstacle 6: [[6.0, 6.0], [5.8, 6.0], [5.8, -0.0], [6.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 7: [[6.0, 10.0], [5.8, 10.0], [5.8, 7.0], [6.0, 7.0]]
			Obstacle 8: [[7.2, 10.0], [7.0, 10.0], [7.0, 1.0], [7.2, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 9: [[8.4, 8.5], [8.2, 8.5], [8.2, -0.0], [8.4, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 10: [[9.3, 8.5], [8.4, 8.5], [8.4, 8.3], [9.3, 8.3]]
			Obstacle 11: [[10.0, 7.3], [9.3, 7.3], [9.3, 7.1], [10.0, 7.1]]
			Obstacle 12: [[9.3, 6.1], [8.4, 6.1], [8.4, 5.9], [9.3, 5.9]]
			Obstacle 13: [[10.0, 4.9], [9.3, 4.9], [9.3, 4.7], [10.0, 4.7]]

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 9.5)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

[09/05/2024 09:59:32 PM] The path needs to navigate between obstacles and should leverage the provided breakpoint. Here's a possible adjusted path:

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Initial Segment:** The initial upward movement to (0.5, 9.5) is valid.
2. **Navigating Obstacles:** Instead of moving directly towards the breakpoint, we need to navigate around obstacles 3 and 5. 
3. **Leveraging the Breakpoint:**  We can guide the path downwards, going around the left side of obstacle 3, then utilize the breakpoint (4.8, 0.5) to pass through the gap between obstacles 5 and 8. 
4. **Reaching the Goal:** After the breakpoint, a clear path exists to the goal set.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    
    (0.5, 9.5),   
    (2.1, 9.5),  # Go around obstacle 3

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.7, 0.7], [0.3, 0.7], [0.3, 0.3], [0.7, 0.3]]

    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Missing breakpoint sets:
 		Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.8, 0.5)]
	

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[09/05/2024 09:59:46 PM] The current path attempts to traverse above all the obstacles, which is not possible due to obstacles 3, 5, 7, and 8 forming a barrier. It is important to note the valid subpath ends very close to the breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1. Therefore, the path can be adjusted to go through this breakpoint. Subsequently, the path can navigate through the gaps between obstacles to reach the goal. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  
    (0.5, 0.6), 
    (4.8, 0.5), 
    (4.8, 0.6),
    (7.5, 0.6), 
    (9.5, 0.6) 
]
```

Here's the breakdown:

1. **(0.5, 0.5) -> (0.5, 0.6):**  A slight adjustment from the starting point to align with the breakpoint.
2. **(0.5, 0.6) -> (4.8, 0.5):** Moves towards the breakpoint, passing below Obstacle 1.
3. **(4.8, 0.5) -> (4.8, 0.6):**  A slight vertical movement to be in line with the gap between Obstacles 6 and 8.
4. **(4.8, 0.6) -> (7.5, 0.6):**  Navigates through the gap between Obstacles 6 and 8.
5. **(7.5, 0.6) -> (9.5, 0.6):**  Moves directly to the goal, passing below Obstacle 9.

[09/05/2024 09:59:57 PM] The initial path attempts to move directly right at the top of the environment, but this is blocked by Obstacles 3 and 5. 

Instead, the path should leverage the breakpoint in Set 1 at (4.8, 0.5).  To avoid obstacles, the path can initially move to the right, then upwards to avoid the lower obstacles. After reaching the breakpoint, the path can then move right towards the goal.

Here is a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (2.0, 0.5),    # Move right, staying clear of obstacles
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Move upwards, avoiding Obstacle 6
    (4.8, 2.0),    # Move right, reaching the x-coordinate of the breakpoint
    (4.8, 0.5),    # Move down to the breakpoint
    (9.5, 0.5)     # Move right to the goal set

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.7, 0.7], [0.3, 0.7], [0.3, 0.3], [0.7, 0.3]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.7, 0.8], [9.3, 0.8], [9.3, 0.4], [9.7, 0.4]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.2, 9.0], [1.0, 9.0], [1.0, -0.0], [1.2, -0.0]]

			Obstacle 4: [[3.6, 9.0], [3.4, 9.0], [3.4, -0.0], [3.6, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 5: [[4.8, 10.0], [4.6, 10.0], [4.6, 1.0], [4.8, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 6: [[6.0, 6.0], [5.8, 6.0], [5.8, -0.0], [6.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 7: [[6.0, 10.0], [5.8, 10.0], [5.8, 7.0], [6.0, 7.0]]
			Obstacle 8: [[7.2, 10.0], [7.0, 10.0], [7.0, 1.0], [7.2, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 9: [[8.4, 8.5], [8.2, 8.5], [8.2, -0.0], [8.4, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 10: [[9.3, 8.5], [8.4, 8.5], [8.4, 8.3], [9.3, 8.3]]
			Obstacle 11: [[10.0, 7.3], [9.3, 7.3], [9.3, 7.1], [10.0, 7.1]]
			Obstacle 12: [[9.3, 6.1], [8.4, 6.1], [8.4, 5.9], [9.3, 5.9]]
			Obstacle 13: [[10.0, 4.9], [9.3, 4.9], [9.3, 4.7], [10.0, 4.7]]
			Obstacle 14: [[9.3, 3.7], [8.4, 3.7], [8.4, 3.5], [9.3, 3.5]]
			Obstacle 15: [[10.0, 2.5], [9.3, 2.5], [9.3, 2.3], [10.0, 2.3]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.8, 0.5)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 5.5), (4.8, 5.5), (4.8, 0.5), (9.5, 0.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 2 between points (0.5, 5.5) and (4.8, 5.5) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 1: [[1.2, 9.0], [1.0, 9.0], [1.0, -0.0], [1.2, -0.0]])
				Obstacle 4: [[3.6, 9.0], [3.4, 9.0], [3.4, -0.0], [3.6, -0.0]])
				Obstacle 5: [[4.8, 10.0], [4.6, 10.0], [4.6, 1.0], [4.8, 1.0]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 5.5)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/05/2024 10:00:33 PM] The current path collides with obstacles when going to the right because it's not taking the gap between obstacles 3 and 7 into account. The path needs to navigate through this gap to reach the goal. 

The provided valid subpath reaches the breakpoint, so the new path will continue from there.
