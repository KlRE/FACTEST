# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.7, 0.7], [0.3, 0.7], [0.3, 0.3], [0.7, 0.3]]

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.7, 0.7], [0.3, 0.7], [0.3, 0.3], [0.7, 0.3]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.8, 0.5)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 5.5), (2.0, 5.5), (2.0, 0.5), (4.8, 0.5), (9.5, 0.6)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 2 between points (0.5, 5.5) and (2.0, 5.5) intersects with obstacle(s):

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 5.5)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

[09/05/2024 10:15:33 PM] The current path goes too far to the right initially, causing it to collide with Obstacle 1.  Instead, the path should go left to the breakpoint first, then it can navigate around the obstacles on the right side.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 1.5),    # Move upwards to avoid obstacle 1
    (4.8, 1.5),    # Move rightwards towards breakpoint 1, staying above obstacle 2
    (4.8, 0.5),    # Pass through breakpoint 1
    (9.5, 0.6)     # Move to the goal within the goal set

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

[09/05/2024 10:15:54 PM] The current path directly cuts through several obstacles. Instead, the path needs to navigate through the gaps between the obstacles. One strategy is to move up, go around the obstacles on the left, and then head towards the goal.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 9.5),    # Move upwards, avoiding obstacles 
    (4.8, 9.5),   # Move right, staying above the obstacles
    (4.8, 0.5),    # Move downwards, passing through the breakpoint
    (9.5, 0.6)     # Move right towards the goal set
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles by:

1. **Moving Upwards:** The path first moves upwards to a y-coordinate greater than the highest point of all obstacles. 
2. **Moving Right:** Then, it moves rightwards, staying above all obstacles.
3. **Moving Downwards:** After passing the obstacles, the path moves downwards, passing through the breakpoint.
4. **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, the path moves right towards the center of the goal set.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.7, 0.7], [0.3, 0.7], [0.3, 0.3], [0.7, 0.3]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.7, 0.8], [9.3, 0.8], [9.3, 0.4], [9.7, 0.4]]

    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.2, 9.0], [1.0, 9.0], [1.0, -0.0], [1.2, -0.0]]

			Obstacle 11: [[10.0, 7.3], [9.3, 7.3], [9.3, 7.1], [10.0, 7.1]]
			Obstacle 12: [[9.3, 6.1], [8.4, 6.1], [8.4, 5.9], [9.3, 5.9]]
			Obstacle 13: [[10.0, 4.9], [9.3, 4.9], [9.3, 4.7], [10.0, 4.7]]
			Obstacle 14: [[9.3, 3.7], [8.4, 3.7], [8.4, 3.5], [9.3, 3.5]]

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.7, 0.7], [0.3, 0.7], [0.3, 0.3], [0.7, 0.3]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.8, 0.5)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, 9.5), (4.8, 9.5), (4.8, 0.5), (9.5, 0.6)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 1 between points (0.5, 0.5) and (2.0, 9.5) intersects with obstacle(s):

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.5, 0.5)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[09/05/2024 10:16:52 PM] The current path fails because it tries to move directly to the right at a y-value of 9.5, colliding with Obstacles 3 and 5.  We need to find a way around these obstacles.

Instead of moving directly right, let's try going down, then right, then up to the goal:

1. **Start:** (0.5, 0.5) - Same as before.
2. **Down to Breakpoint:** (0.5, 0.5) -> (4.8, 0.5)  -  Move down to the breakpoint.
3. **Right to Goal:** (4.8, 0.5) -> (9.5, 0.6) - Move right to the goal set. 

This avoids all obstacles and passes through the breakpoint.

**New Path:**
```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (4.8, 0.5),
    (9.5, 0.6)

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.7, 0.7], [0.3, 0.7], [0.3, 0.3], [0.7, 0.3]]

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.5, 0.5)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (4.8, 0.5),    # Pass through Breakpoint Set 1 
    (4.8, 8.75),    # Move upwards to avoid obstacles 5 and 7
    (9.5, 8.75),    # Move rightwards towards the goal
    (9.5, 0.6)     # End within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(0.5, 0.5) to (4.8, 0.5):** Move horizontally to the right to reach the breakpoint. 
2. **(4.8, 0.5) to (4.8, 8.75):**  Move vertically upwards to avoid obstacles 5 and 7.
3. **(4.8, 8.75) to (9.5, 8.75):**  Move horizontally to the right towards the goal, staying clear of obstacle 10.
4. **(9.5, 8.75) to (9.5, 0.6):** Move vertically downwards to enter the goal set. 

This path avoids all obstacles, passes through the breakpoint, and successfully connects the start and goal sets.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response

    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

[09/05/2024 10:17:39 PM] The initial path choice is flawed as it tries to directly cut across the environment, colliding with numerous obstacles right from the start. 

A safer and more efficient approach is to leverage the gap between obstacles at the top of the environment.  

Here's a possible revised path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   // Starting point within the start set
    (0.5, 8.75),  // Move upwards to clear the obstacles
    (4.8, 8.75),  // Move rightwards, aligning with the breakpoint
    (9.5, 8.75),  // Move rightwards towards the goal set
    (9.5, 0.6)   // Move down into the goal set
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Vertical Movement:** The path now initially moves directly upwards from the start point to avoid the cluster of obstacles at the bottom. 
2. **Breakpoint Alignment:**  The path aligns itself with the breakpoint (4.8, 0.5) before moving horizontally, ensuring it passes through the breakpoint.
3. **Horizontal Movement at Top:** By moving along the top, the path exploits the clear space and avoids any obstacle intersections.

This revised path adheres to the non-crossing requirement, passes through a breakpoint, and successfully reaches the goal set.

[09/05/2024 10:17:46 PM] The initial path was attempting to move horizontally at a high y-value, leading to collisions. Instead, let's leverage the breakpoint and navigate below the obstacles.

1. **Start at the breakpoint:** Since the breakpoint (4.8, 0.5) is within the start set, we can begin there.
2. **Move horizontally:**  All obstacles are located above y = 1. Therefore, we can safely move horizontally towards the goal set.
3. **Reach the goal set:** Connect the last waypoint directly to a point within the goal set. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (4.8, 0.5),   # Start at the breakpoint
    (9.5, 0.5),   # Move horizontally to the goal set
    (9.5, 0.6)    # Move slightly up to be within the goal set

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

[09/05/2024 10:17:54 PM] The current path fails because it starts at the breakpoint and moves horizontally. This immediately causes a collision with Obstacle 6. To reach the goal set, the path needs to navigate between the obstacles while considering the start and goal set constraints.

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Start within the start set:** Choose a starting point within the blue start set, for example (0.5, 0.5).
2. **Navigate upwards:**  Move upwards to a y-coordinate greater than the highest point of all obstacles, say (0.5, 9.5)
3. **Move towards the breakpoint:** Head right towards the breakpoint at (4.8, 0.5), reaching  (4.8, 9.5).
4. **Descend to breakpoint:** Move down to the breakpoint at (4.8, 0.5)
5. **Proceed to the goal set:** Continue right towards the goal set, reaching a point within the goal set, for example, (9.5, 0.5).

Therefore, a corrected path could be:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 9.5), 
    (4.8, 9.5),

[09/05/2024 10:18:05 PM] The initial path attempts to move directly to the right, which leads to a collision with Obstacle 1. We need a path that goes around this obstacle. The key is to use the breakpoint (4.8, 0.5) and navigate around the obstacles using a combination of upward and rightward movements.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   // Start within the start set
    (0.5, 9.5),   // Move upwards to avoid Obstacle 1
    (4.8, 9.5),   // Move rightwards, staying above the obstacles
    (4.8, 0.5),   // Move downwards, passing through the breakpoint
    (9.5, 0.5)    // Move rightwards to reach the goal set 
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles:

- It goes vertically up to clear all the initial obstacles.
- It uses the breakpoint to navigate to the other side of the obstacles.
-  Finally, it moves directly right to the goal.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.7, 0.7], [0.3, 0.7], [0.3, 0.3], [0.7, 0.3]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.7, 0.8], [9.3, 0.8], [9.3, 0.4], [9.7, 0.4]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.8, 0.5)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 9.5), (4.8, 9.5), (4.8, 0.5), (9.5, 0.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 2 between points (0.5, 9.5) and (4.8, 9.5) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 3: [[2.4, 10.0], [2.2, 10.0], [2.2, 6.0], [2.4, 6.0]])
				Obstacle 5: [[4.8, 10.0], [4.6, 10.0], [4.6, 1.0], [4.8, 1.0]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 9.5)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/05/2024 10:18:25 PM] The current path goes directly over the top of obstacle 3 and into obstacle 5. Instead, we should aim for the breakpoint (4.8, 0.5) and then go to the goal from there. 

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (4.8, 0.5), 
    (9.5, 0.5)
