# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.

[09/05/2024 08:56:29 PM] The current path collides with Obstacle 2 because it attempts to move straight upwards from the breakpoint (2.0, -2.5).  

Instead, the path should move to the right first to avoid Obstacle 2 completely. One way to do this is to move horizontally at the level of the breakpoint until reaching an x-coordinate that allows for safe upward movement to the goal set.

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  
    (2.0, -2.5), 
    (3.5, -2.5),  # Move right, staying below Obstacle 2

[09/05/2024 08:56:45 PM] The provided path attempts to cross Obstacle 2 directly. To circumvent this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle. 

Instead of going directly to the breakpoint (2.0, 5.5), we can route the path around Obstacle 2. Here's how:

1. **From the valid subpath's end:**  The last valid point is (2.0, -2.5).
2. **Maneuver around Obstacle 2:** Move rightward, giving Obstacle 2 a wide berth.  A waypoint like (3.0, -2.5) achieves this.
3. **Ascend above Obstacle 2:** Continue rightward and then ascend to a point above Obstacle 2, such as (3.0, 6.0).
4. **Proceed to the goal:**  Finally, move leftward towards the goal set, reaching a point like (4.5, 4.5).

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (2.0, -2.5), 
    (3.0, -2.5),
    (3.0, 6.0),

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, -2.5), (-1.0, -2.5), (-1.0, 5.5), (2.0, 5.5), (4.5, 4.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 3 between points (-1.0, -2.5) and (-1.0, 5.5) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 2: [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, -2.5), (-1.0, -2.5)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

[09/05/2024 08:58:03 PM] The path needs to navigate around Obstacle 2 to reach the goal. Since the valid subpath already passes through the breakpoint (2.0, -2.5), we can try to continue the path from there.

1. **Continue from the valid subpath:** From waypoint (3.0, -3.0), instead of going up, we can move further right to circumvent Obstacle 2.

2. **Avoid Obstacle 2:** We can achieve this by adding a waypoint to the right of Obstacle 2, ensuring we maintain enough distance to avoid a collision.

3. **Reach the goal:** From this new waypoint, we can move towards the goal set without intersecting any obstacles.

[09/05/2024 08:58:07 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid intersecting Obstacle 1. Since the longest valid subpath takes us below Obstacle 1, we can try going around it from the bottom. 

Here is a possible adjusted path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # start in the start set
    (2.0, -2.5),  # breakpoint
    (2.0, -3.0),  # continue moving down to clear Obstacle 1
    (7.0, -3.0),  # move right to clear Obstacle 1
    (7.0, 5.5),  # move up to the level of the goal set
    (4.5, 4.5)   # move left to the goal set
] 

[09/05/2024 08:58:07 PM] Parsed response: [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, -2.5), (2.0, -3.0), (7.0, -3.0), (7.0, 5.5), (4.5, 4.5)]
