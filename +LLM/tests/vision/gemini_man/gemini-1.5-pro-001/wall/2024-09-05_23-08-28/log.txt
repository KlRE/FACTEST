# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.0, 1.0], [8.0, 1.0], [8.0, -0.0], [9.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.0, -4.0), (4.0, 3.0)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

[09/05/2024 11:08:53 PM] The current path intersects with the obstacle. To avoid this, the path needs to go around the obstacle. There are two possible ways to go around the obstacle: above or below. Let's analyze which path is better:

1. **Path above the obstacle:**
    - We can route the path above the obstacle by first going up and then moving diagonally towards the goal.
    - This path seems longer but safer as it maintains a good distance from the obstacle.

2. **Path below the obstacle:**
    - This path requires squeezing through a narrow space between the obstacle and the bottom edge of the environment. 
    - It's shorter but might be difficult to maintain a safe distance from the obstacle.

Considering the safety and ease of planning, choosing the path above the obstacle seems like a better option. Also, we need to utilize one breakpoint from Set 1: [(4.0, -4.0), (4.0, 3.0)]. From the two available, (4.0, 3.0) aligns better with the chosen path above the obstacle.

Therefore, the updated path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start point
    (0.5, 4.0),   # Move up, staying clear of the obstacle 
    (4.0, 3.0),   # Move diagonally to the breakpoint 
    (8.5, 0.5)    # Continue diagonally to the end point
]
```
