# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

[09/05/2024 08:13:30 PM] The first segment of the path directly crosses obstacle 1. To circumnavigate this, the path needs to go around obstacle 1. We can achieve this by first moving towards the right, going below obstacle 1, then going up on the right side of obstacle 1. After passing obstacle 1, the provided path uses the breakpoint (0.5, 3.0) which lies in a narrow passage between obstacles 3 and 7. To simplify the path and avoid this bottleneck, we can route the path below obstacle 7. This allows for a smoother trajectory towards the breakpoint (0.5,-2.75). From there, the path can continue as previously planned, moving right and then upwards to reach the goal set.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[6.0, 7.0], [5.0, 7.0], [5.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[-2.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0], [-2.0, -1.0], [0.0, -1.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(0.5, -2.75), (0.5, 3.0), (0.5, 8.75)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[09/05/2024 08:14:04 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid obstacles 3 and 7. Instead of going straight up from (-1.0, 5.5) to (-1.0, 8.75), we can route the path around the left side of obstacles 3 and 7.

Here's how we can adjust the path:

1. **From the last valid point (-1.0, 5.5):** Move further left to avoid obstacle 3, for example, to the point (-2.5, 5.5). 
2. **Move upwards:**  Continue moving upwards to clear obstacle 7, reaching a point above it like  (-2.5, 9.5).
3. **Navigate towards the breakpoint:** Move right towards the breakpoint (0.5, 8.75), passing through a point like (0.5, 9.5) to avoid the corner of obstacle 7.
4. **Connect to the rest of the path:** The rest of the path from the breakpoint (0.5, 8.75) to the goal remains valid.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [(-3.5, 6.5), (-3.5, 5.5), (-1.0, 5.5), (-2.5, 5.5), (-2.5, 9.5), (0.5, 9.5), (0.5, 8.75), (5.5, 8.75), (5.5, 6.5)]

[09/05/2024 08:14:33 PM] The path goes up into obstacle 6 because it is trying to reach the breakpoint (0.5, 8.75). Instead, we can use the breakpoint (0.5, 3.0) to navigate below most of the obstacles. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5), 
    (-3.5, 5.5), 
    (-1.0, 5.5), 
    (-0.5, 5.5), # Adjusted to avoid obstacle 7
    (-0.5, 3.0), # Using breakpoint (0.5, 3.0)
    (0.5, 3.0),
    (5.5, 3.0),
    (5.5, 6.5)
]
```

This path avoids obstacles by:

*  Moving slightly to the right before descending to the breakpoint (0.5, 3.0), avoiding obstacle 7. 
*  Once past the breakpoint, it moves horizontally to the right, staying clear of all obstacles.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[-2.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(0.5, -2.75), (0.5, 3.0), (0.5, 8.75)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(-3.5, 6.5), (-3.5, 5.5), (-1.0, 5.5), (-0.5, 5.5), (-0.5, 3.0), (0.5, 3.0), (0.5, 3.0), (5.5, 3.0), (5.5, 6.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

[09/05/2024 08:14:52 PM] The path goes too far down and crosses obstacles unnecessarily. It also misses the breakpoints. A better strategy is to navigate above the obstacles to reach the goal.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  # Start within the start set
    (-3.5, 8.75), # Move upwards to the breakpoint
    (0.5, 8.75),  # Move rightwards to the breakpoint
    (5.5, 8.75), # Continue rightwards
    (5.5, 6.5)   # Move down to the goal set
]
```

Explanation of changes:

1. **Start:** We start from the same point (-3.5, 6.5) inside the start set.
2. **Navigate Upwards:**  We move directly upwards to breakpoint (0.5, 8.75), staying clear of obstacles 6 and 7.
3. **Navigate Rightwards:** We then move rightwards to (5.5, 8.75), safely above all obstacles. 
4. **Reach Goal:** Finally, we move down to (5.5, 6.5) to end up within the goal set.

This new path avoids all obstacles, passes through a breakpoint, and successfully connects the start and goal sets.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[6.0, 7.0], [5.0, 7.0], [5.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[-2.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0]]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(-3.5, 6.5), (-3.5, 8.75), (0.5, 8.75), (5.5, 8.75), (5.5, 6.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(-3.5, 6.5)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

[09/05/2024 08:14:58 PM] The current path goes straight upwards into Obstacle 6. Since this is unavoidable from the provided valid subpath, a new path must be chosen.

The first breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1 is not usable as it is below all obstacles and is blocked in by Obstacle 8.

The second breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1 is also not usable, as it sits in the middle of Obstacles 3 and 7.

The third breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1 appears to be the only viable option.  It can be approached by first moving right and going around the right side of Obstacles 3 and 7. From there, the breakpoint can be used to bypass all other obstacles.

[09/05/2024 08:15:33 PM] The path goes directly through multiple obstacles and does not include the breakpoint. The path needs to navigate between the obstacles to reach the goal.

Let's start by adjusting the second waypoint to avoid Obstacle 1. We can do this by going around the right side of it: 

new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5), 
    (-3.5, 4.0), 
    (-1.0, 0.0), 
    (0.5, -2.75), 
    (5.5, -2.75), 
    (5.5, 6.5)
]

Now the path avoids the first obstacle, but still intersects the remaining obstacles. To address this, we can route the path below all the obstacles and then upwards to the goal:

new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),
    (-3.5, 4.0),
    (-1.0, -3.0),
    (5.5, -3.0),
    (5.5, 6.5),
]

This updated path successfully navigates the environment, avoiding all obstacles, and reaching the goal within the goal set.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[6.0, 7.0], [5.0, 7.0], [5.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[-2.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0], [-2.0, -1.0], [0.0, -1.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[-1.0, 6.0], [1.0, 4.0], [3.0, 6.0], [1.0, 8.0]]
			Obstacle 4: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -1.0], [4.0, -1.0]]
			Obstacle 5: [[6.0, 3.0], [4.0, 3.0], [4.0, 1.0], [6.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 6: [[-2.0, 10.0], [-4.0, 10.0], [-4.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 8.0]]
			Obstacle 7: [[0.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 6.0], [0.0, 6.0]]
			Obstacle 8: [[-1.0, 0.0], [1.0, -2.0], [3.0, 0.0], [1.0, 2.0]]
			Obstacle 9: [[4.0, 8.0], [2.0, 8.0], [2.0, 6.0], [4.0, 6.0]]
			Obstacle 10: [[6.0, 10.0], [4.0, 10.0], [4.0, 8.0], [6.0, 8.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(0.5, -2.75), (0.5, 3.0), (0.5, 8.75)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 2 between points (-3.5, 4.0) and (-1.0, 0.0) intersects with obstacle(s):

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(-3.5, 6.5), (-3.5, 4.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(0.5, -2.75), (0.5, 3.0), (0.5, 8.75)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(-3.5, 6.5), (-3.5, 4.0), (-1.0, 4.0), (1.0, 4.0), (3.0, 4.0), (3.0, -2.75), (0.5, -2.75), (5.5, -2.75), (5.5, 6.5)]

## Feedback

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

[09/05/2024 08:15:54 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid obstacles 4 and 8. We can achieve this by routing the path below obstacle 8. 

From the last valid waypoint (3.0, 4.0), we can move downwards to a point below obstacle 8, for example, (3.0, -3.0). From there, we can connect to the breakpoint (0.5, -2.75) and continue with the existing path to the goal. 

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [(-3.5, 6.5), (-3.5, 4.0), (-1.0, 4.0), (1.0, 4.0), (3.0, 4.0), (3.0, -3.0), (0.5, -2.75), (5.5, -2.75), (5.5, 6.5)]

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[6.0, 7.0], [5.0, 7.0], [5.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[-2.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0], [-2.0, -1.0], [0.0, -1.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[-1.0, 6.0], [1.0, 4.0], [3.0, 6.0], [1.0, 8.0]]
			Obstacle 4: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -1.0], [4.0, -1.0]]
			Obstacle 5: [[6.0, 3.0], [4.0, 3.0], [4.0, 1.0], [6.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 6: [[-2.0, 10.0], [-4.0, 10.0], [-4.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 8.0]]
			Obstacle 7: [[0.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 6.0], [0.0, 6.0]]
			Obstacle 8: [[-1.0, 0.0], [1.0, -2.0], [3.0, 0.0], [1.0, 2.0]]
			Obstacle 9: [[4.0, 8.0], [2.0, 8.0], [2.0, 6.0], [4.0, 6.0]]
			Obstacle 10: [[6.0, 10.0], [4.0, 10.0], [4.0, 8.0], [6.0, 8.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(0.5, -2.75), (0.5, 3.0), (0.5, 8.75)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(-3.5, 6.5), (-3.5, 4.0), (-1.0, 4.0), (-1.0, -3.0), (0.5, -2.75), (5.5, -2.75), (5.5, 6.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 3 between points (-1.0, 4.0) and (-1.0, -3.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 2: [[0.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0], [-2.0, -1.0], [0.0, -1.0]])
				Obstacle 8: [[-1.0, 0.0], [1.0, -2.0], [3.0, 0.0], [1.0, 2.0]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(-3.5, 6.5), (-3.5, 4.0), (-1.0, 4.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
