# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(-3.5, 6.5), (-3.5, 3.0), (0.5, 3.0), (0.5, -2.75), (6.5, -2.75), (6.5, 6.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Incorrect, The path does not end inside the goal set [[6.0, 7.0], [5.0, 7.0], [5.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0]].

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(-3.5, 6.5)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Goal Position: End within the specified rectangular goal set.
Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

[09/05/2024 08:34:55 PM] The path needs to navigate around obstacle 1 and then stay clear of obstacles 6 and 7 to reach the goal.  Additionally, the path should pass through one of the breakpoints. The breakpoint (0.5, 8.75) seems like a good choice as it allows the path to navigate above obstacles 6 and 7. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  # Start within the start set
    (-3.5, 8.75), # Move upwards to the breakpoint, avoiding obstacle 1 
    (0.5, 8.75),  # Move right to the breakpoint

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[6.0, 7.0], [5.0, 7.0], [5.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[-2.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0], [-2.0, -1.0], [0.0, -1.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[-1.0, 6.0], [1.0, 4.0], [3.0, 6.0], [1.0, 8.0]]
			Obstacle 4: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -1.0], [4.0, -1.0]]
			Obstacle 5: [[6.0, 3.0], [4.0, 3.0], [4.0, 1.0], [6.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 6: [[-2.0, 10.0], [-4.0, 10.0], [-4.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 8.0]]

			Obstacle 10: [[6.0, 10.0], [4.0, 10.0], [4.0, 8.0], [6.0, 8.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(0.5, -2.75), (0.5, 3.0), (0.5, 8.75)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(-3.5, 6.5), (-1.0, 6.5), (-1.0, 8.75), (0.5, 8.75), (5.5, 8.75), (5.5, 6.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 1 between points (-3.5, 6.5) and (-1.0, 6.5) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 7: [[0.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 6.0], [0.0, 6.0]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(-3.5, 6.5)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[-2.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0]]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(-3.5, 6.5), (-3.5, 5.5), (-2.0, 5.5), (0.0, 5.5), (0.5, 8.75), (2.0, 8.0), (4.0, 8.0), (5.5, 8.0), (5.5, 6.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]

[09/05/2024 08:35:53 PM] The path needs to navigate around obstacles 6 and 7 to reach the goal. Here's a possible approach:

1. **Starting Point:**  We can keep the starting point at (-3.5, 6.5).

2. **Avoiding Obstacles 6 and 7:**  Instead of going directly right, we can move downwards to avoid obstacle 7. A waypoint around (-3.5, 5.5) would be suitable.

3. **Reaching Breakpoint:** From there, we can head towards the breakpoint (0.5, -2.75), navigating between obstacles. Waypoints like (-1.0, 5.5), (-1.0, 0.5), and (0.5, 0.5) would guide the path.

4. **Towards the Goal:** After the breakpoint, a straight path to (5.5, -2.75) is clear.  

5. **Final Approach:** Finally, move upwards to (5.5, 6.5) to reach the goal set.

**New Path:**

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data

    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[-2.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0], [-2.0, -1.0], [0.0, -1.0]]

[09/05/2024 08:36:01 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 2. To do this, we can route the path around the obstacle, ensuring it stays clear of its boundaries. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5), 
    (-3.5, 5.5), 
    (-1.0, 5.5), 
    (-1.0, -1.5),
    (0.5, -1.5),
    (0.5, -2.75), 
    (5.5, -2.75), 
    (5.5, 6.5)
]
```

Here's the thought process behind the changes:

1. **Maintain the valid subpath:** The initial part of the path, up to (-1.0, 5.5), remains valid.
2. **Navigate around Obstacle 2:** Instead of going straight down, the path now moves further down to (-1.0, -1.5), circumventing Obstacle 2 entirely.
3. **Connect to the breakpoint:** From (-1.0, -1.5), the path moves horizontally to the breakpoint (0.5, -2.75). 
4. **Continue to the goal:** The remaining segments of the path can remain as they were, connecting the breakpoint to the goal set without intersecting any obstacles.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[-2.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0]]

[09/05/2024 08:36:56 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid Obstacle 8. Instead of going down directly to the breakpoint (0.5, -2.75), we can route the path around the left side of Obstacle 8.

Here's how we can adjust the path:

1. **From the last valid point (0.5, 3.0):** Move slightly left to (-0.5, 3.0) to avoid the top vertex of Obstacle 8. 
2. **Navigate below Obstacle 8:** Continue left to (-1.5, 3.0) and then downwards to (-1.5, -2.75) passing Obstacle 8 on the left.
3. **Connect to the remaining path:** Finally, move rightwards to meet the breakpoint at (0.5, -2.75) and continue with the original path to the goal.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [

    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

[09/05/2024 08:37:35 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid crossing Obstacle 4. We can achieve this by navigating around this obstacle.

1.  **Valid Subpath:** We can utilize the valid subpath provided: [(-3.5, 6.5), (-3.5, 5.5), (-1.0, 5.5), (-1.0, 3.0), (0.5, 3.0), (2.5, 3.0), (3.5, 3.0)].

2.  **Navigating Around Obstacle 4:**  Instead of going straight down, we can guide the path around Obstacle 4. 

3.  **Reaching the Breakpoint:** From the last point of the valid subpath (3.5, 3.0), we can move rightward, clear of Obstacle 4, and then downwards to reach the breakpoint (3.5, -2.75).

4.  **Reaching the Goal Set:** Finally, we can move rightward again and then upward to enter the goal set.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5), 
    (-3.5, 5.5),

[09/05/2024 08:37:44 PM] The current path collides with obstacle 5 because it goes to the right at y=3.0. A better approach is to go below this obstacle by utilizing the breakpoint at (0.5, -2.75). 

From the last valid waypoint (3.5, 3.0):
1. **Move Down:** Go directly south to a point below Obstacle 5, for example, (3.5, -2.75).
2. **Approach Breakpoint:** Move horizontally east to the breakpoint at (0.5, -2.75).
3. **Navigate to Goal:** Move to a point directly north of the goal set, such as (5.5, -2.75). Finally, go north to reach the goal set, for example, at (5.5, 6.5).

[09/05/2024 08:38:02 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 5. Since the valid subpath takes us to a breakpoint that is useful, we can continue from there.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[6.0, 7.0], [5.0, 7.0], [5.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[-2.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0], [-2.0, -1.0], [0.0, -1.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[-1.0, 6.0], [1.0, 4.0], [3.0, 6.0], [1.0, 8.0]]
			Obstacle 4: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -1.0], [4.0, -1.0]]
			Obstacle 5: [[6.0, 3.0], [4.0, 3.0], [4.0, 1.0], [6.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 6: [[-2.0, 10.0], [-4.0, 10.0], [-4.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 8.0]]
			Obstacle 7: [[0.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 6.0], [0.0, 6.0]]
			Obstacle 8: [[-1.0, 0.0], [1.0, -2.0], [3.0, 0.0], [1.0, 2.0]]
			Obstacle 9: [[4.0, 8.0], [2.0, 8.0], [2.0, 6.0], [4.0, 6.0]]
			Obstacle 10: [[6.0, 10.0], [4.0, 10.0], [4.0, 8.0], [6.0, 8.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(0.5, -2.75), (0.5, 3.0), (0.5, 8.75)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(-3.5, 6.5), (-3.5, 5.5), (-1.0, 5.5), (-1.0, 3.0), (0.5, 3.0), (2.5, 3.0), (3.5, 3.0), (3.5, -2.75), (5.5, -2.75), (5.5, 6.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 7 between points (3.5, 3.0) and (3.5, -2.75) intersects with obstacle(s):

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[09/05/2024 08:38:09 PM] The current path fails because it tries to cross obstacle 4 directly. Instead, we should navigate around this obstacle. We can accomplish this by leveraging the provided breakpoints.

- The path correctly reaches the breakpoint (0.5, 3.0).
- Instead of continuing straight down, we can utilize the breakpoint (0.5, 8.75).
- From there, we can move horizontally to the right, avoiding obstacles 9 and 10.
- Finally, we can descend into the goal set.

Here's the adjusted path:
