# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[-2.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0]]

[09/05/2024 08:33:14 PM] Switching to Gemini location europe-west2
[09/05/2024 08:33:25 PM] The initial path went directly down from the starting position and intersected with Obstacle 1. To correct this, the path should go around this obstacle. 

Since we need to pass through a breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1: [(0.5, -2.75), (0.5, 3.0), (0.5, 8.75)], let's analyze which one we can use:

* (0.5, -2.75): This breakpoint is too far south and would require a complex path to reach it, likely introducing more chances for collisions.
* (0.5, 8.75): Similar to the previous point, this breakpoint is also too far away (north) and would make the path unnecessarily long.
* (0.5, 3.0): This breakpoint seems promising. It's located directly to the right of the starting position and outside of any obstacles. We can use this breakpoint to navigate around Obstacle 1. 

Therefore, a possible correction for the path is:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5), # Start point
    (-3.5, 4.5), # Go down, avoiding Obstacle 1
    (0.5, 4.5), # Go right, towards the breakpoint
    (0.5, 3.0),  # Reach the breakpoint 
    (3.5, 3.0), # Go right, avoiding Obstacles 3 and 8
    (3.5, 6.5), # Go up towards the goal
    (5.5, 6.5)  # Reach the goal 
] 
```

This new path successfully avoids Obstacle 1 by going around it and passes through the breakpoint (0.5, 3.0). It also avoids other obstacles on its way to the goal.

[09/05/2024 08:33:32 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 9. To do this, we can reroute the path to go below Obstacle 9. 

We can achieve this by following these steps:

1. From the last valid waypoint (3.5, 3.0), move further right to (4.5, 3.0) to avoid the corner of Obstacle 9.
2. Move upwards to (4.5, 4.5) to be on the same y-level as the breakpoint.
3. Move right and slightly upwards, passing through breakpoint (0.5, 4.5) to reach (3.5, 4.75).
4. Finally, move right to (5.5, 4.75), which falls within the goal set.

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [(-3.5, 6.5), (-3.5, 4.5), (0.5, 4.5), (0.5, 3.0), (3.5, 3.0), (4.5, 3.0), (4.5, 4.5), (3.5, 4.75), (5.5, 4.75)]

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Goal Position: End within the specified rectangular goal set.
Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[09/05/2024 08:33:41 PM] The current path fails because it tries to cross obstacle 5. We can fix this by going around the obstacle using additional waypoints:

1. **Continue from the valid subpath:** The last valid point in the provided path is (3.5, 3.0). 
2. **Go around obstacle 5:** Instead of moving directly to the right, we can navigate around obstacle 5 by first going down and then right.
3. **Reach the goal set:** After clearing obstacle 5, we can adjust our path upwards to reach the goal set.

Here is the updated path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5), 
    (-3.5, 4.5), 
    (0.5, 4.5),

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[6.0, 7.0], [5.0, 7.0], [5.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[-2.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(0.5, -2.75), (0.5, 3.0), (0.5, 8.75)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(-3.5, 6.5), (-1.5, 6.5), (-1.5, 8.75), (0.5, 8.75), (0.5, 3.0), (3.5, 3.0), (3.5, 6.5), (5.5, 6.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(-3.5, 6.5)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

[09/05/2024 08:33:58 PM] The initial segment of the path attempts to cross between obstacles 6 and 7, but there's no space for a straight line. It seems like navigating above these obstacles might be easier. We can try using the breakpoint (0.5, 8.75) to our advantage. 

Let's adjust the path to move upwards first, passing through the breakpoint, and then going towards the goal:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),
    (-3.5, 8.75),  # Move upwards, clearing obstacle 6
    (0.5, 8.75),   # Utilize the breakpoint

    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/05/2024 08:34:39 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to go around Obstacle 3. The path can do so by moving downwards before reaching Obstacle 3. Using the breakpoint (0.5, 3.0) will help.
