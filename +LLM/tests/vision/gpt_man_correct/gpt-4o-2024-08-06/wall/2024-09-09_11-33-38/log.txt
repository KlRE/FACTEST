# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.0, 1.0], [8.0, 1.0], [8.0, -0.0], [9.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.

        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[09/09/2024 11:33:52 AM] To create a path from the start set to the goal set while avoiding the obstacle, follow these steps:

1. **Choose a Starting Point:** Start from a point within the start set. Let’s choose (0.5, 0.5).

2. **Consider Breakpoints:** Select a breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1. Let’s choose (4.0, -4.0).

3. **Navigate Around the Obstacle:** Move around the obstacle while avoiding it. Since the obstacle spans from (2.0, -4.0) to (7.0, 4.0), keep a safe distance while passing the breakpoint.

4. **Choose an Ending Point:** End at a point within the goal set. Let’s choose (8.5, 0.5).

Here is the path waypoints representation:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Starting within the start set
    (4.0, -4.0),   # Passing through a breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1
    (8.5, 0.5)     # Ending within the goal set
]
```

This planned path avoids the obstacle and uses one breakpoint.

[09/09/2024 11:34:09 AM] To construct a valid path while avoiding the obstacle and satisfying all requirements, let's analyze the spatial relationships and make necessary adjustments.

### Analysis:
1. **Start and End Points**:
   - The path correctly starts within the start set and ends in the goal set.

2. **Obstacle Intersection**:
   - The segment from (0.5, 0.5) to (4.0, -4.0) intersects with Obstacle 1, which extends from [6.0, 4.0] to [2.0, -4.0].

3. **Adjusting Path**:
   - Since Obstacle 1 spans diagonally, we should try to avoid entering its space by contouring around its edges.
   - Use the breakpoints effectively to navigate around the obstacle.

### Proposed Adjustments:

- **Start**: Begin with (0.5, 0.5).
- **Routing Around the Obstacle**:
  - Move vertically upward or choose a safe waypoint to avoid the lower boundary of the obstacle and intersect at one of the breakpoints.
  - Utilize Breakpoint Set 1: Choose one valid breakpoint to pass through.

### New Path Proposal:

Let's adjust the path to avoid crossing with the obstacle while passing through a breakpoint and reaching the goal:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),     # Start point
    (4.0, 3.0),     # Use the upper breakpoint to go over the obstacle
    (8.5, 0.5)      # Move to the goal set
]
```

### Justification:
- The segment from (0.5, 0.5) to (4.0, 3.0) avoids the obstacle by moving over it.
- The breakpoint (4.0, 3.0) ensures we stay clear of the obstacle's boundary.
- The final segment from (4.0, 3.0) to (8.5, 0.5) heads directly toward the goal without intersecting the obstacle.

This path adjustment maintains all requirements, avoids the obstacle, and efficiently utilizes the given breakpoints.

[09/09/2024 11:34:16 AM] ### Analysis and Adjustments

1. **Current Path Evaluation:**
   - The path starts from the start set at (0.5, 0.5) and initially goes to the breakpoint (4.0, 3.0).
   - The segment from (4.0, 3.0) to (8.5, 0.5) intersects with Obstacle 1, which is not allowed.

2. **Obstacle Avoidance Strategy:**
   - **Avoiding Obstacle 1:** The critical issue is getting around Obstacle 1. We need to find a waypoint that navigates around this while maintaining optimal distance.
   - An effective strategy would be to add an additional waypoint to circumvent the obstacle completely from above, given that moving upwards is unrestricted.

3. **Path Adjustments:**
   - From the initial valid subpath [(0.5, 0.5), (4.0, 3.0)], add a waypoint around Obstacle 1.
   - Choose a waypoint that safely bypasses the obstacle, considering the spatial layout.
   - Aim to still reach the goal set efficiently after circumventing the obstacle.

### New Path Proposal

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start in the start set.
    (4.0, 3.0),   # Initial breakpoint.
    (7.0, 5.0),   # New waypoint to navigate above the obstacle.
    (8.5, 0.5)    # End in the goal set.
]
```

- **Explanation:**
  - The added waypoint (7.0, 5.0) allows the path to curve above Obstacle 1, ensuring no intersection.
  - This maintains a clear path from start to goal while adhering to constraints.

Review and adjust further as needed based on spatial considerations and additional obstacles.
