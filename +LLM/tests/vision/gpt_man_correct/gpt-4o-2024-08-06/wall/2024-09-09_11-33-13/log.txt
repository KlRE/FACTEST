# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.0, 1.0], [8.0, 1.0], [8.0, -0.0], [9.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.

[09/09/2024 11:33:19 AM] Here's a suggested path that meets the given requirements:

1. **Start in the Start Set**: Choose a point within the blue quadrilateral, such as (0.5, 0.5).
2. **Pass through Breakpoint Set 1**: Choose (4.0, -4.0).
3. **End in the Goal Set**: Choose a point within the green quadrilateral, such as (8.5, 0.5).

Ensure these waypoints create a path without intersecting any obstacles and respect the environment's constraints.

### Proposed Path:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start in the start set
    (4.0, -4.0), # Pass through a breakpoint
    (8.5, 0.5)   # End in the goal set
]
```

This path avoids the obstacle and passes through the necessary breakpoints while staying within the start and goal areas.

[09/09/2024 11:33:30 AM] ### Path Analysis and Adjustment

- **Start and Goal Positions**: The path correctly begins within the start quadrilateral and ends within the goal quadrilateral.

- **Initial Path Problem**: The path segment from (0.5, 0.5) to (4.0, -4.0) crosses Obstacle 1, which is defined by vertices [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]. Avoiding this intersection is crucial.

### Obstacle Avoidance Strategy

1. **Bypass Method**: To avoid Obstacle 1, a new waypoint will be chosen that allows the path to curve around the obstacle without intersecting it.

2. **Path through Breakpoints**: Ensure passing through the preferred breakpoints (in this case, possibly (4.0, 3.0) since (4.0, -4.0) was problematic).

### New Path Proposition

To bypass the obstacle and ensure that the path passes through breakpoints without intersection, consider adjusting the path as follows:

- Start within the start set, e.g., (0.5, 0.5).
- Redirect towards the upper breakpoint (4.0, 3.0), avoiding the obstacle.
- Move towards the goal by bypassing any remaining parts of Obstacle 1.
- End at a suitable point within the goal set, like (8.5, 0.5).

### Suggested New Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start in the start set
    (2.0, 3.0),    # Move diagonally to circumvent the obstacle on the upper side
    (4.0, 3.0),    # Through the upper breakpoint to ensure compliance
    (8.5, 0.5)     # End in the goal set
]
```

This proposed path avoids obstacles by moving around them at the upper breakpoint, ensuring that each segment remains free of intersections. Make sure to visually verify this adjusted path to confirm that there are no hidden intersections with the obstacle.

[09/09/2024 11:33:38 AM] To create a valid path that avoids intersecting with obstacles, we need to adjust the segment that crosses Obstacle 1. Let's follow these steps:

### Analyze the Current Path
1. **Start Point**: The path begins at (0.5, 0.5), which is within the start set. This is correct.
2. **Path Segment 3**: The segment from (4.0, 3.0) to (8.5, 0.5) intersects Obstacle 1. We need to adjust this section.
3. **Avoiding Obstacle 1**: The obstacle is defined by the vertices [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]].

### Plan Path Adjustments
1. **Bypass Obstacle 1**: Since the obstacle spans diagonally, a potential detour is to go above it.
2. **Use Breakpoints**: Utilize the available breakpoints ((4.0, -4.0) or (4.0, 3.0)) strategically to ensure compliance.

### New Path Proposal
1. Start at **(0.5, 0.5)**.
2. First, move to **(2.0, 3.0)**, maintaining the same path for the initial valid section.
3. Move to **(4.0, 3.0)**, which is a valid checkpoint.
4. **Bypass Strategy**: Move above the obstacle by heading to **(7.0, 5.0)**, to clear the upper edge of Obstacle 1.
5. Move back down to **(8.5, 0.5)** in the goal set, ensuring it is a touchpoint.

This path ensures we bypass the obstacle by moving above it and descending into the goal area.

```python
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start in the start set
    (2.0, 3.0),    # First valid path segment
    (4.0, 3.0),    # Use Breakpoint
    (7.0, 5.0),    # By-pass above the obstacle
    (8.5, 0.5)     # End in the goal set
