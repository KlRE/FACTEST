# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

[09/09/2024 08:34:52 AM] To plan a path from the start set to the goal set while avoiding the obstacle, let's consider the environment and requirements:

### Observation:
- **Start Set**: Bottom-left (blue).
- **Goal Set**: Top-right (green).
- **Obstacle**: Centrally located (red diamond).
- **Breakpoints**: (5.12, 0.56) and (5.12, 9.44).

### Path Planning:
We must avoid the red obstacle and pass through one of the breakpoints. We will achieve this by moving vertically to bypass the obstacle area and then proceed towards the goal.

### Path:
1. **Start Point**: Let's take (1.75, 1.75) from within the start set.
2. **Move Vertically Upwards**: Use the bottom breakpoint to stay clear of the obstacle. Reach (5.12, 0.56).
3. **Continue Upwards**: Avoid the obstacle. Reach (5.12, 9.44).
4. **Move to Goal**: From the top breakpoint, head to (9.0, 9.0) within the goal set.

### New Path Format:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # start in the start set
    (5.12, 0.56),  # pass through the bottom breakpoint
    (5.12, 9.44),  # move upwards to the top breakpoint
    (9.0, 9.0)     # end in the goal set
]
```

This structured path carefully avoids the obstacle and meets all the specified requirements.

[09/09/2024 08:34:59 AM] To correct the path while avoiding obstacles, let's analyze the spatial relationships between the environment elements:

1. **Initial Valid Path**:
    - The start point is correctly placed within the start set at (1.75, 1.75).
   
2. **Breakpoint Set 1**:
    - The current path uses the breakpoint (5.12, 0.56), which is a valid choice to begin avoiding the lower side of the obstacle.

3. **Identifying the Issue**:
    - The segment between (5.12, 0.56) and (5.12, 9.44) crosses Obstacle 1. We need to reroute around this obstacle.

4. **Path Modification**:
    - After reaching (5.12, 0.56), the path can be adjusted to go around Obstacle 1. 
    - Instead of heading directly north which causes a collision, we move slightly horizontally and then upwards.

5. **Suggested Path**:
    - Start from the valid subpath: move from (1.75, 1.75) to (5.12, 0.56).
    - Add a new waypoint, for instance, (5.12, 3.5) to safely move upwards while avoiding the obstacle.
    - Proceed horizontally to (7.5, 9.0) to get past the obstacle horizontally.
    - Finally, connect to (9.0, 9.0) inside the goal set.
   
With these considerations, the new path becomes:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start in the start set
    (5.12, 0.56),  # Pass through the first breakpoint
    (5.12, 3.5),   # Move upwards avoiding the obstacle
    (7.5, 9.0),    # Move past the obstacle horizontally
    (9.0, 9.0)     # End in the goal set
]
```

This path should now avoid all obstacles while satisfying the path requirements.

[09/09/2024 08:35:05 AM] ### Observations and Analysis
1. **Start and End Positions:** The path correctly starts within the start set and ends within the goal set.
2. **Obstacle Intersection:** The second segment from (5.12, 0.56) to (5.12, 3.5) intersects with the first obstacle. This vertical path cuts through the obstacle, violating the non-crossing requirement.
3. **Valid Subpath:** The longest valid subpath from the start is [(1.75, 1.75), (5.12, 0.56)].

### Adjustments
1. **Bypass Strategy:** Since the intersection occurs on the second segment, one possible resolution is to adjust this segment by moving around the obstacle.
2. **Analyzing Breakpoints:** While the path passes through (5.12, 0.56), it doesn't meet the condition for staying clear of the obstacle. Both breakpoints are along the y-axis; (5.12, 0.56) is near the lower base of the obstacle.

### New Path Strategy
- **Adjusting the Problematic Segment:** Instead of moving vertically up from (5.12, 0.56), we can add an intermediate waypoint to bypass the right side of the obstacle.
- **Alternating Breakpoints:** To avoid going through the obstacle, move horizontally from (5.12, 0.56) to the right, then upwards along the x-axis clear of the obstacle, before continuing to the goal.

### Proposed New Path
1. Start at (1.75, 1.75) in the start set.
2. Move to (5.12, 0.56) to utilize the breakpoint.
3. Shift rightwards to avoid the obstacle: (7.0, 0.56).
4. Move upwards, clearing the obstacle: (7.0, 8.0).
5. Finally, move diagonally to reach the goal set at (9.0, 9.0).

This path ensures there is no intersection with the obstacle by introducing an intermediate maneuver around it.

[09/09/2024 08:35:13 AM] To adjust the path to avoid intersecting with the obstacle, let's analyze the spatial relationships and make necessary adjustments:

1. **Current Path Overview**:
   - Starts within the start set and passes through a breakpoint.
   - The segment from (7.0, 0.56) to (7.0, 8.0) intersects with Obstacle 1.

2. **Path Analysis**:
   - The start to the first breakpoint segment is valid.
   - The critical segment intersects a diagonal of Obstacle 1 due to it spanning vertically across the obstacle.

3. **Adjustments**:
   - After reaching (5.12, 0.56), change direction to move diagonally upward around the obstacle.
   - Add a waypoint beyond the obstacle's boundary to ensure avoidance.
   - Continue smoothly to the goal set.

4. **New Path**:
   - Start the path at (1.75, 1.75), a valid position within the start set.
   - Go to (5.12, 0.56), hitting the required breakpoint.
   - Adjust the path to move upwards without crossing the obstacle, directing towards (7.0, 5.0), which is clear of the obstacle's boundary.
   - Then shift to (9.0, 8.0) to approach the goal.
   - Finally, end at (9.0, 9.0) within the goal set.

**New Path**:
```python
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # start within the start set
    (5.12, 0.56),  # breakpoint in Set 1
    (7.0, 5.0),    # above the obstacle
    (9.0, 8.0),    # towards the goal
    (9.0, 9.0)     # end within the goal set
]
``` 

This path avoids crossing the obstacle and fulfills all requirements, ensuring it passes through a required breakpoint.

[09/09/2024 08:35:22 AM] To correct the path, let's analyze the spatial relationship between the waypoint segments and the obstacles.

### Initial Analysis
1. **Start Position:** Correct, starting within the start set at (1.75, 1.75).
2. **Goal Position:** Correct, ending within the goal set at (9.0, 9.0).
3. **Obstacle Intersection:** The segment from (5.12, 0.56) to (7.0, 5.0) intersects with Obstacle 1. We need to adjust the path to avoid this obstacle.

### Strategy for Adjustment
- **Path from Start to Breakpoint:** Maintain the segment from (1.75, 1.75) to (5.12, 0.56) since this is valid.
- **Adjust Intersection Segment:** The current path from (5.12, 0.56) intersects Obstacle 1. Consider rerouting this segment above or around the obstacle.
- **Maintain Goal Segment:** Ensure the path still ends in the goal set.

### Proposed Path Adjustment
1. **Start at (1.75, 1.75)**: Stay within the start set.
2. **Pass through Breakpoint at (5.12, 0.56)**: Ensures compliance with requirements.
3. **Avoiding Obstacle**: Add a waypoint to navigate around Obstacle 1's top edge before reaching the goal:
   - **New waypoint**: Move slightly upwards, for example, to (5.5, 5.5).
   - **Path to Goal**: Finally navigate to the goal set at approximately (9.0, 9.0).

### New Path Proposal
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),   # Start
    (5.12, 0.56),   # Breakpoint 1
    (5.5, 5.5),     # Navigate around the top of the obstacle
    (9.0, 9.0)      # End in the goal set
]
```

This new path should effectively avoid the obstacle while connecting the start and goal sets. Ensure enough clearance from the obstacle to prevent intersections.

[09/09/2024 08:35:27 AM] To adjust the path and avoid intersecting with Obstacle 1, let's analyze the spatial relationships:

1. **Current Valid Subpath:**
   - The path starts at (1.75, 1.75) and successfully reaches the breakpoint (5.12, 0.56).

2. **Obstacle Intersection:**
   - The segment from (5.12, 0.56) to (5.5, 5.5) intersects with the obstacle.
   - We need to redirect this segment to avoid crossing the obstacle.

3. **Obstacle Avoidance Strategy:**
   - Move around the obstacle by adjusting the path from (5.12, 0.56).
   - Utilize the top breakpoint (5.12, 9.44) to navigate above the obstacle and then approach the goal set.

4. **New Path:**
   - Start from a point in the start set: (1.75, 1.75).
   - Proceed to the lower breakpoint: (5.12, 0.56).
   - Navigate upwards to the upper breakpoint to bypass the obstacle: (5.12, 9.44).
   - Move towards the goal set, making sure to end within it: (9.0, 9.0).

By using both breakpoints strategically, we avoid the obstacle and satisfy all path requirements.

[09/09/2024 08:35:34 AM] To correct the path, I'll address the issue with the segment that crosses Obstacle 1 and ensure the path remains clear of obstacles while passing through the breakpoints.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Invalid Segment:** The segment from (5.12, 0.56) to (5.12, 9.44) crosses Obstacle 1. This necessitates a detour.
2. **Longest Valid Subpath:** We can start from (1.75, 1.75) to (5.12, 0.56), which is clear.

### Strategy for Correction
- **Detour Around Obstacle:** From (5.12, 0.56), I'll propose waypoints that skirt around the edges of the obstacle while ensuring clearance.
- **Pass Through Breakpoints:** Both breakpoints should be considered—useful if they aid in detouring.
- **Reach Goal Set:** Ensure the path ends in the goal set.

### Path Adjustment
1. **Start Point:** Begin at (1.75, 1.75).
2. **First Breakpoint:** Move to (5.12, 0.56) as it's clear.
3. **Detour:** To avoid Obstacle 1, move northwest, then directly upward:
   - Move to (6.0, 1.0) to bypass the obstacle edge, maintaining a safe distance.
   - Move upward to (6.0, 8.0) to clear the height of the obstacle.
4. **Align with Final Breakpoint:** Head to (8.0, 9.0) to align with the goal set.
5. **End Point:** Terminate in the goal set at (9.0, 9.0).

### New Path
The revised path with adjusted waypoints to avoid obstacles is as follows:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start point
    (5.12, 0.56),  # First Breakpoint
    (6.0, 1.0),    # Move around the obstacle
    (6.0, 8.0),    # Move upward
    (8.0, 9.0),    # Move towards the goal
    (9.0, 9.0)     # End point in the goal set
]
```

### Conclusion
This new path provides a clear detour around the obstacle while adhering to the requirements and passing through necessary breakpoints.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.

[09/09/2024 08:35:41 AM] To revise the path so that it avoids the obstacle, we can analyze and modify the segments:

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Valid Path**: The path starts at (1.75, 1.75) and moves to (5.12, 0.56), then to (6.0, 1.0), which is valid.
2. **Obstacle Intersection**:
   - The segment from (6.0, 1.0) to (6.0, 8.0) crosses the obstacle defined by vertices [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]. 
3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - We need to find an alternate path to avoid crossing the obstacle. Instead of going straight up from (6.0, 1.0), we can navigate around the obstacle.

### New Path Proposal:
1. **Maintain Start Path**: Begin from (1.75, 1.75) to (5.12, 0.56) to (6.0, 1.0).
2. **Navigate Around the Obstacle**:
   - From (6.0, 1.0), move toward (9.0, 5.0) to bypass the obstacle from the right.
   - Then move diagonally upwards to (8.0, 8.0) to ensure clearance around the obstacle.
3. **Approach Goal**:
   - From (8.0, 8.0), move directly to (9.0, 9.0) which lies within the goal set.

### New Path:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start in the start set
    (5.12, 0.56),  # Pass through the breakpoint
    (6.0, 1.0),    # Initial valid point
    (9.0, 5.0),    # Navigate around the obstacle
    (8.0, 8.0),    # Ensure clearance from the obstacle
    (9.0, 9.0)     # End in the goal set
]
```

This path avoids crossing the obstacle and maintains a clear route from start to goal while passing through the necessary breakpoints.

[09/09/2024 08:35:49 AM] To correct the path and ensure it avoids intersecting the obstacle, let's analyze and adjust the segments:

### Analysis:
1. **Start and Goal Sets:**
   - The path correctly starts in the given start set `(1.75, 1.75)` and ends within the goal set.

2. **Obstacle Intersection:**
   - The fourth segment from `(9.0, 5.0)` to `(8.0, 8.0)` intersects with the obstacle.

3. **Breakpoints:**
   - The path includes the breakpoint `(5.12, 0.56)`.

### Adjustments Needed:
1. **Fix Intersection:**
   - Since the segment from `(9.0, 5.0)` to `(8.0, 8.0)` intersects the obstacle, we need to modify this part.

2. **Reroute around the Obstacle:**
   - Introduce new waypoints to navigate around the obstacle without crossing it.

### New Path Suggestion:
- **Option 1:** Reroute through the top.

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Starting point
    (5.12, 0.56),  # Breakpoint
    (6.0, 1.0),    # Continue upwards
    (9.0, 3.0),    # Move diagonally upwards to avoid the obstacle
    (9.5, 8.5)     # Final destination within the goal set
]
```

### Explanation:
- **(9.0, 3.0):** A waypoint added above the existing path to avoid the intersection with the obstacle.
- **(9.5, 8.5):** Chooses a point within the goal set to ensure the path ends correctly.

This adjusted path should avoid any obstacle intersections while adhering to all the task requirements.
