# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[6.0, 7.0], [5.0, 7.0], [5.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[-2.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0]]

			Obstacle 7: [[0.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 6.0], [0.0, 6.0]]
			Obstacle 8: [[-1.0, 0.0], [1.0, -2.0], [3.0, 0.0], [1.0, 2.0]]
			Obstacle 9: [[4.0, 8.0], [2.0, 8.0], [2.0, 6.0], [4.0, 6.0]]
			Obstacle 10: [[6.0, 10.0], [4.0, 10.0], [4.0, 8.0], [6.0, 8.0]]

[09/09/2024 09:01:44 AM] Based on the provided environment details and considering the spatial relationships, here is a possible path that satisfies all the requirements:

### Path Description:

1. **Start Point**: Begin within the start set at a point such as `(-3.5, 6.5)`.
2. **Navigate Around Obstacles**: Carefully choose waypoints to navigate through gaps and around obstacles:
   - Initially move right to avoid the obstacles below the start set.
   - Select waypoints that contour around the obstacles neatly and maintain a safe distance.
3. **Use Breakpoint**: Ensure at least one waypoint coincides with a selected breakpoint:
   - Use the breakpoint `(0.5, 8.75)` from the available set.
4. **End Point**: Finish within the goal set at a point such as `(5.5, 6.5)`.

### New Path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),     # Start in the start set
    (-1.0, 7.5),     # Move diagonally up and right to avoid obstacle 3
    (0.5, 8.75),     # Pass through Breakpoint 1
    (2.5, 7.5),      # Continue right, avoiding possible collisions
    (4.5, 7.0),      # Navigate towards the goal area
    (5.5, 6.5)       # End in the goal set
]
```

This path appropriately avoids obstacles and adheres to all specified constraints and requirements.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[09/09/2024 09:01:56 AM] To create a valid path that avoids crossing obstacles, I'll analyze the spatial relationships and adjust the waypoints accordingly:

### Observations
1. **Start and Goal Positions:**
   - Start anywhere within the quadrilateral `Start` set: [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]].
   - Goal anywhere within the quadrilateral `Goal` set: [[6.0, 7.0], [5.0, 7.0], [5.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0]].

2. **Initial Path Issue:**
   - The segment between (-3.5, 6.5) and (-1.0, 7.5) intersects with obstacle 7.

3. **Constraints:**
   - We need a path that passes through one breakpoint (chosen: (0.5, 3.0)).

### Path Adjustments
1. **Starting Point:**
   - Start at (-3.5, 6.5), and continue as this was valid.

2. **Avoid Obstacle 7:**
   - The first obstacle causing intersection requires the path to detour around it.
   - Adjust the path to dip slightly below the obstacle and connect to a safe region.
   
3. **Pass Through Breakpoint:**
   - Use (0.5, 3.0) as a valid breakpoint since it lies between obstacles 8 and 2 and south of obstacle 3.
   
4. **Complete the Path:**
   - Once past the obstacles, navigate up to the goal set while avoiding any final obstacles.

### New Path Proposal
- Starting in the Start set: (-3.5, 6.5)
- Move left and down to pass under Obstacle 7: (-2.0, 5.5)
- Lead towards the Breakpoint: (0.5, 3.0)
- Steer safely to the final position in the Goal set: (5.5, 6.5)

### Suggested Path
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  # Start point within Start set
    (-2.0, 5.5),  # Move around obstacle 7
    (0.5, 3.0),   # Breakpoint chosen, situated between obstacles
    (5.5, 6.5)    # End point within Goal set
]
```

By taking this route, we can navigate safely between the obstacles, ensuring no intersections occur while maintaining the requirement to pass through a designated breakpoint.
