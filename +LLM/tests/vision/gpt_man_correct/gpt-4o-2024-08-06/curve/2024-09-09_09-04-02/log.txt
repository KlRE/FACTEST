# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]

[09/09/2024 09:04:11 AM] To design a path from the start set to the goal set while avoiding obstacles and passing through the given breakpoints, we can follow these steps:

1. **Choose a Start Point**: Select a point within the start set. Let's choose (-3.5, 6.5).

2. **Select Breakpoints**: We need to pass through one of each set. Let's select:
   - Breakpoint 1: (0.5, 3.0) (from Breakpoint Set 1)

3. **Plan the Path**: Navigate from the start point to the end point via selected breakpoints while avoiding obstacles.
   - Start at (-3.5, 6.5).
   - Move to the right, avoiding the first cluster of obstacles, going through (0.5, 3.0).
   - Continue moving to the right and a little upwards to avoid the bottom-right cluster of obstacles, ending at (5.5, 6.5) in the goal set.

Here's the planned path as a series of waypoints:

### Planned Path
```python
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  # Start point within the start set
    (-0.5, 6.5),  # Move right avoiding obstacles
    (0.5, 3.0),   # First selected breakpoint
    (4.5, 3.0),   # Move right, avoiding obstacles
    (5.5, 6.5),  # End point within the goal set
]
```

This path ensures no intersection with any obstacles and adheres to the requirement of passing through the designated breakpoints.

[09/09/2024 09:04:22 AM] ### Path Correction Analysis

1. **Initial Assessment**:
   - The path starts correctly in the start set and ends in the goal set.
   - The path currently intersects with Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 7 immediately after the start.

2. **Obstacle Avoidance Strategy**:
   - **Obstacle 3**: Since this obstacle is centrally located, the path should either bypass it from above or below. Considering the current issues with the path intersecting with this obstacle, a higher or lower route should be considered.
   - **Obstacle 7** is positioned directly above the start set, necessitating consideration of its location when plotting the course.

3. **Breakpoint Passage**:
   - The path must pass through the breakpoint (0.5, 3.0) as it's already included in the planned path.

4. **Suggested Path Adjustments**:
   - Begin within the start set, e.g., (-3.5, 6.5).
   - Direct the path north to avoid Obstacle 7 by following a route north of Obstacle 3 but clear of Obstacle 7.
   - Adapt movement to engage the required breakpoint (0.5, 3.0), then head towards the goal avoiding obstacles.
   - Finally, approach the goal set from a point free from obstacles.

### Proposed New Path

To implement these considerations, the revised pathway is proposed as follows:

```python
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),    # Start within the start set
    (-3.5, 9.0),    # Go upwards to avoid Obstacle 3 and 7
    (0.5, 8.75),    # Pass through the higher breakpoint
    (0.5, 3.0),     # Move downward passing through the required breakpoint
    (5.5, 6.5)      # End in the goal set
]
```

### Explanation

- **(-3.5, 6.5) to (-3.5, 9.0)**: Move vertically upwards to bypass Obstacle 7, remaining clear of Obstacle 3.
- **(-3.5, 9.0) to (0.5, 8.75)**: Move across without intersecting with any obstacles and pass through a higher breakpoint.
- **(0.5, 8.75) to (0.5, 3.0)**: Ensure to pass through the essential breakpoint while descending.
- **(0.5, 3.0) to (5.5, 6.5)**: Safely route towards the goal after clearing known obstacles.

[09/09/2024 09:04:30 AM] To adjust the path and ensure it avoids obstacles, let's evaluate the current path and find a better route.

### Analysis

1. **Initial Segment**: The path from the starting point \((-3.5, 6.5)\) to \((-3.5, 9.0)\) intersects with Obstacle 6. We need to modify this path to avoid the obstacle.

2. **Obstacle Avoidance and Breakpoints**: The path should pass through one of the breakpoints. We should aim to incorporate one of them while steering clear of obstacles.

3. **Proposed Modifications**:
   - First, find a new starting point path that doesn't interfere with Obstacle 6. We can choose a point slightly to the right to avoid the obstacle.

4. **Mid Path**:
   - Attempting to incorporate a breakpoint, we can navigate between obstacles and choose a more strategic path.

### New Path Proposal

1. **Start**: Begin at a point slightly to the right of the original start \((-3.5, 6.5)\). We can adjust to a point such as \((-3.0, 6.5)\).

2. **First Leg**: Move vertically towards a breakpoint:
    - \((-3.0, 6.5)\) to \((0.5, 8.75)\) which is a safe breakpoint.

3. **Second Leg**: Navigate downward while avoiding obstacles:
    - From \((0.5, 8.75)\), move directly downward to \((0.5, 3.0)\), another breakpoint.

4. **Final Leg**: Move straight to a point safely inside the goal:
    - Move from \((0.5, 3.0)\) to \((5.5, 6.5)\).

### Adjusted Path

This path strategically avoids obstacles, uses breakpoints efficiently, and meets the starting and ending conditions:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (-3.0, 6.5),
    (0.5, 8.75),
    (0.5, 3.0),
    (5.5, 6.5)
]
```

### Conclusion

The new path carefully moves between and over the obstacles, ensuring no crossings occur while satisfying all path requirements. The use of strategic waypoints ensures a smooth journey from the start to the goal.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.

[09/09/2024 09:04:38 AM] To adjust the path and avoid obstacles while passing through the required breakpoints, I'll analyze and modify each segment of the original path:

### Analysis

1. **Starting Point**: The path starts correctly from (-3.0, 6.5) within the start set.

2. **First Segment (-3.0, 6.5) to (0.5, 8.75)**: This segment intersects with Obstacle 7. To avoid this obstacle, a new waypoint must be chosen.

3. **Breakpoints**: We need to pass through one of the breakpoints. The original segment passes through (0.5, 8.75), but this leads to an intersection.

4. **Obstacle Avoidance Strategy**:
    - Avoid Obstacle 7 by passing below it after reaching a safe breakpoint.
    - Incorporate a path that goes around Obstacle 3, which affects a large area near the center.
  
5. **Ending Point**: The path ends at (5.5, 6.5), which is within the goal set.

### New Path Proposal

**New Waypoints:**

1. **Start**: (-3.0, 6.5)
2. **New Breakpoint**: Go around the left side of Obstacle 7 using (0.5, 3.0).
3. **Pass between**: Add a waypoint to carefully navigate around the bottom-right side of Obstacle 3, for example, (1.5, 5.5).
4. **End**: (5.5, 6.5) within the goal set, avoiding Obstacle 9 by keeping distance.

### New Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (-3.0, 6.5),      # Start inside the start set
    (0.5, 3.0),       # Breakpoint: pass safely below Obstacle 7
    (1.5, 5.5),       # Navigate around Obstacle 3
    (5.5, 6.5)        # End inside the goal set
]
```

This path ensures the path respects the spatial constraints while passing through a required breakpoint and reaching the goal.

[09/09/2024 09:04:50 AM] To correct the path, we need to address the issue with the second segment intersecting Obstacle 3. Here's how we can adjust the path:

### Analysis of Current Path

1. **Start Point:** The path starts within the start set correctly.
2. **Obstacle Encounter:** The segment from (0.5, 3.0) to (1.5, 5.5) intersects with Obstacle 3. We need to find a way around this obstacle.
3. **Breakpoints:** Ensure the path passes through a breakpoint. The current path uses (0.5, 3.0), which is a valid breakpoint.

### Obstacle Avoidance Strategy

- **Obstacle 3:** To avoid this, we can move further right before moving up, avoiding the area of overlap with Obstacle 3.

### Proposed New Path

1. **Start in the Start Set:** Begin at (-3.0, 6.5).
2. **Proceed Right and Down to Breakpoint:** Use a safe route to reach a breakpoint, avoiding Obstacle 8:
   - Move to (0.5, 3.0), ensuring we angle upwards without striking Obstacle 8. This part of the subpath is still valid.
3. **Re-route Around Obstacle 3:**
   - Move towards the right, passing slightly above the contour of Obstacle 3, for example using (1.5, 4.0).
   - Ascend carefully to avoid the overlap area, move to (3.0, 5.0).
4. **Towards the Goal Set:** Finally,
   - Move upwards and slightly right to (5.5, 6.5) to end in the goal set.

### Final New Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (-3.0, 6.5),   # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 3.0),    # Breakpoint ensuring no intersection with Obstacle 8
    (1.5, 4.0),    # Move past Obstacle 3 without intersecting
    (3.0, 5.0),    # Continue upwards in a safe zone avoiding obstructions
    (5.5, 6.5)     # End within the goal set
]
```

This proposed adjustment takes into account the need to avoid the problematic intersection with Obstacle 3, while still passing through a necessary breakpoint and maintaining a valid path from start to goal.
