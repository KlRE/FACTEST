# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

[09/09/2024 08:57:17 AM] To create a path that satisfies the requirements, we need to plan around the obstacles while using the breakpoints and ensuring the path starts in the start set and ends in the goal set. Here's a possible path:

### New Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),    # Start near the center of the start set
    (0.5, 3.0),     # Go through the first set of breakpoints
    (1.5, 5.0),     # Move to the right of Obstacle 3 to avoid it
    (4.5, 7.0),     # Move up and right, avoiding obstacles
    (5.5, 6.5)      # End inside the goal set
]
```

### Explanation

1. **Start Point: (-3.5, 6.5)**
   - Chosen within the start set to begin the path.

2. **Waypoint: (0.5, 3.0)**
   - This is the breakpoint from the first set. It avoids the obstacles below the start set.

3. **Waypoint: (1.5, 5.0)**
   - Moves closer to the goal while avoiding the left side of Obstacle 3. The path passes north of Obstacle 2.

4. **Waypoint: (4.5, 7.0)**
   - Continues moving upward and to the right to bypass the top of Obstacle 5, ensuring the path stays clear of Obstacle 9.

5. **End Point: (5.5, 6.5)**
   - Chosen within the goal set to conclude the path.

This path successfully avoids all obstacles and incorporates the required breakpoints, ensuring safe navigation from the start to the goal.

[09/09/2024 08:57:26 AM] ### Analysis and Path Adjustment

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - The initial path starts at the start set and ends at the goal set correctly.
   - The segment from (0.5, 3.0) to (1.5, 5.0) intersects with Obstacle 3, which spans from points [-1.0, 6.0], [1.0, 4.0], [3.0, 6.0], and [1.0, 8.0]. To avoid intersection, this path segment needs adjustment.

2. **Identifying the Gap**:
   - There's a visible gap between Obstacle 3 and the path from (0.5, 3.0) onwards. The path needs to navigate through this space effectively.

3. **Adjusting the Path**:
   - **Start**: Begin at the midpoint of the start set, say (-3.5, 6.5), ensuring it's slightly above the obstacle base.
   - **Move to Breakpoint**: The initial path is correct until (0.5, 3.0).
   - **Avoid Obstacle 3**: Instead of moving directly upwards, adjust the route to navigate around Obstacle 3 by moving slightly right and upwards:
     - From (0.5, 3.0) to a new waypoint that skirts around the edge of Obstacle 3, perhaps (2.0, 3.0), moving then towards the top right of the obstacle.
   - **Continue to Goal**: After navigating around Obstacle 3, adjust the path back towards the goal:
     - Make a gentle arc towards (4.5, 7.0), ensuring a clearance from Obstacle 9.
   - **End in Goal Set**: Finally, ensure the last waypoint, such as (5.5, 6.5), ensures the endpoint lies within the goal area without crossing other obstacles.

### New Path Proposal

new_path = [
   (-3.5, 6.5),  # Start in the start set
   (0.5, 3.0),   # Pass through Breakpoint set 1
   (2.0, 3.0),   # Navigate around Obstacle 3
   (4.5, 7.0),   # Move towards the goal
   (5.5, 6.5)    # End in the goal set
]

This new path takes care to avoid crossing any obstacles and maintains clearance throughout.

[09/09/2024 08:57:32 AM] To create a valid path that avoids obstacles and connects the start and goal sets, we need to reconsider the problematic segment and adjust it to avoid intersection with Obstacle 9.

### Existing Valid Path Analysis
- **First Segment:** `(-3.5, 6.5)` to `(0.5, 3.0)` — Correct, doesn’t intersect any obstacles.
- **Second Segment:** `(0.5, 3.0)` to `(2.0, 3.0)` — Correct, clear of obstacles.

### Problematic Segment
- **Third Segment:** `(2.0, 3.0)` to `(4.5, 7.0)` — Needs adjustment as it intersects Obstacle 9.

### New Path Proposal
1. **Starting Point:** `(-3.5, 6.5)` — Inside the start set.
2. **First Breakpoint:** `(0.5, 3.0)` — Already passes through a breakpoint.
3. **Path Adjustment:**
   - To bypass Obstacle 9, introduce a waypoint above the obstacle and ensure a smooth curve towards the goal.
   - Utilize remaining breakpoints strategically.
4. **New Waypoints:**
   - `(3.5, 4.0)` — Skirt around the bottom of Obstacle 9, staying clear of it.
   - Update the endpoint slightly to ensure the path is clear:
   - `(5.5, 6.5)` — Adjusted within the goal set to avoid crossing close to any obstacle.

### Revised Path
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),
    (0.5, 3.0),
    (3.5, 4.0),
    (5.5, 6.5)
]
```

### Thought Process
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** By adjusting the path to `(3.5, 4.0)`, the path gracefully arches around Obstacle 9 by moving more east before heading north towards the goal.
- **Breakpoints and Ends:** The path still passes through `(0.5, 3.0)` and ends at `(5.5, 6.5)`, ensuring compliance with all path requirements.

This revised path should provide a clear path from the start set to the goal set, avoiding all obstacles effectively.
