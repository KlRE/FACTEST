# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[6.0, 7.0], [5.0, 7.0], [5.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

[09/09/2024 09:03:40 AM] To plan a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles, follow these steps:

### Proposed Path

1. **Start Point:** Choose a point within the start set, such as `(-3.5, 6.5)`.
2. **Waypoint through Breakpoint Set 1:** Choose `(0.5, 3.0)` as a waypoint.
3. **Waypoint avoiding obstacles:** Pass through `(0.5, 5.5)` to go around obstacles.
4. **Waypoint through Breakpoint Set 2 (not needed as per data, skipped).**
5. **Goal Point:** End within the goal set, such as `(5.5, 6.5)`.

### Path
The path should look like this:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),   # Start point in the start set
    (0.5, 3.0),    # Pass through Breakpoint Set 1
    (0.5, 5.5),    # Navigate around obstacles
    (5.5, 6.5)     # End point in the goal set
]
```

### Explanation
- The chosen path begins within the start region.
- It travels through one of the designated breakpoints, `(0.5, 3.0)`, satisfying the requirement to pass through Breakpoint Set 1.
- Waypoints are selected to navigate around the obstacles, ensuring no intersections with them.
- The path ends in the goal set, completing the task requirements.

[09/09/2024 09:03:49 AM] To adjust the path and ensure it avoids obstacles, let's analyze the spatial layout. The current path is:

1. Starts at \((-3.5, 6.5)\) in the start set, which is correct.
2. Moves to the breakpoint \((0.5, 3.0)\), passing through without hitting obstacles.
3. Then moves to \((0.5, 5.5)\), crossing Obstacle 3. We need to create a detour to avoid this.

### Suggested Path Adjustments:

1. **Initial Path**:
   - From \((-3.5, 6.5)\) to \((0.5, 3.0)\) is valid.
  
2. **Avoiding Obstacle 3**:
   - Instead of going directly to \((0.5, 5.5)\), let's use a different waypoint to navigate around Obstacle 3.
   - Move from \((0.5, 3.0)\) to a new waypoint that avoids the obstacle. For instance, move to \((0.5, 7.0)\). This path goes vertically to avoid overlapping with Obstacle 3.

3. **Reaching the Goal**:
   - From \((0.5, 7.0)\), head directly to the goal set at \((5.5, 6.5)\). Here, the path does not intersect any obstacles.

### New Path Proposal:

The new path avoids all specified obstacles while maintaining the required properties:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  # Start in the start set
    (0.5, 3.0),   # Move through the first breakpoint, avoiding obstacles
    (0.5, 7.0),   # Navigate vertically past obstacle 3
    (5.5, 6.5)    # End in the goal set
]
```

This path is designed to maintain a clear route between the start and goal sets by using available breakpoints and creating new waypoints to navigate around obstacles safely.

[09/09/2024 09:04:01 AM] ### Analysis and Adjustments

1. **Initial Path Evaluation**
   - The current path starts correctly within the start set and ends correctly within the goal set.
   - The segment from point (0.5, 3.0) to (0.5, 7.0) intersects with Obstacle 3. Therefore, this part of the path needs to be adjusted to avoid the obstacle.

2. **Obstacle Avoidance**
   - **Obstacle 3:** This obstacle has vertices at [[-1.0, 6.0], [1.0, 4.0], [3.0, 6.0], [1.0, 8.0]]. The segment intersects approximately in the vertical (y-axis) region.
   - To avoid Obstacle 3 efficiently, a waypoint needs to be added to navigate around the perimeter of the obstacle or find a gap.

3. **Path Adjustment Strategy**
   - The first part of the path up to (0.5, 3.0) is valid, as it does not intersect any obstacles.
   - To bypass Obstacle 3, adjust the vertical path just before the obstacle and re-route the next segment more to the right or left outside its perimeter.

4. **Proposed Revised Path**
   - Start from the current valid subpath ending at (0.5, 3.0).
   - Add an intermediate waypoint to detour around Obstacle 3.
   - Continue towards the goal set.

### Revised Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),     # Start within start set
    (0.5, 3.0),      # Valid waypoint and breakpoint
    (2.5, 4.5),      # Navigate around Obstacle 3
    (5.5, 6.5)       # End within goal set
]
```

- **(2.5, 4.5):** This waypoint is chosen to avoid Obstacle 3 and provide a clear path to the goal.

### Conclusion
The revised path starts within the start set and ends within the goal set, passing through required breakpoints and avoiding obstacles effectively. Additional waypoints ensure the path remains clear of obstacle intersections.
