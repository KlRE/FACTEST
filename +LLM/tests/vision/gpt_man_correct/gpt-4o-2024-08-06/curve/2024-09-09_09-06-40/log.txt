# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[6.0, 7.0], [5.0, 7.0], [5.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

			Obstacle 9: [[4.0, 8.0], [2.0, 8.0], [2.0, 6.0], [4.0, 6.0]]
			Obstacle 10: [[6.0, 10.0], [4.0, 10.0], [4.0, 8.0], [6.0, 8.0]]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

[09/09/2024 09:06:46 AM] To find a valid path, we'll choose waypoints that avoid the obstacles and go through a breakpoint from each set while starting and ending in the specified areas.

### Chosen Path

1. **Start Point**: Choose a point in the start set, e.g., `(-3.5, 6.5)`.
2. **Breakpoint from Set 1**: `(0.5, 3.0)`
3. **Breakpoint from Set 2**: `(0.5, 8.75)`
4. **End Point**: Choose a point in the goal set, e.g., `(5.5, 6.5)`

### Path Array

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  # Start in the start set
    (-1.0, 7.5),  # Move up and right to avoid Obstacle 3
    (0.5, 8.75),  # Pass through a breakpoint from Set 2
    (2.0, 8.0),   # Navigate between obstacles 9 and 10
    (5.5, 6.5)    # End in the goal set
]
```

### Explanation
- The path starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
- It avoids crossing any obstacles by choosing a path that navigates between them.
- The path passes through one breakpoint from each required set.
- Each segment of the path maintains a safe distance from obstacles to avoid collision.

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 1 between points (-3.5, 6.5) and (-1.0, 7.5) intersects with obstacle(s):

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(-3.5, 6.5)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

[09/09/2024 09:06:56 AM] To avoid intersecting obstacles, we can make the following adjustments:

### Analysis
1. **Segment 1 (-3.5, 6.5) to (-1.0, 7.5):** This segment intersects with Obstacle 7. We need to adjust this to avoid crossing the obstacle boundary.

2. **Obstacle 7:** Spanned from [0.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 6.0], [0.0, 6.0], so we need to navigate around its edges.
   
3. **Consider Breakpoints:** Ensure we pass through one breakpoint from each set.

### Path Adjustments
1. **Starting Point:** Remains (-3.5, 6.5) since it is valid in the start set.

2. **Adjust Horizontal Movement:** Shift the waypoint slightly downwards before making any significant horizontal movement to avoid Obstacle 7's range.

3. **New Waypoints:**
   - Move diagonally down to avoid the obstacle: (-3.5, 5.5)
   - Curve around the obstacle avoiding intersection: (-2.5, 4.5)
   - Then connect through a valid breakpoint: (0.5, 3.0)
   - Continue towards the goal, staying clear of obstacles: (4.5, 5.5)
   - Finally, enter the goal set: (5.5, 6.5)

### New Path
By making these adjustments, the path can be plotted as follows:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  # Start within the start set
    (-3.5, 5.5),  # Move downwards to avoid Obstacle 7
    (-2.5, 4.5),  # Continue avoiding any obstacle overlap
    (0.5, 3.0),   # Use a breakpoint safely
    (4.5, 5.5),   # Approach the goal while avoiding obstacles
    (5.5, 6.5)    # End within the goal set
]
```

This path minimizes the risk of crossing obstacles by maneuvering around them appropriately.
