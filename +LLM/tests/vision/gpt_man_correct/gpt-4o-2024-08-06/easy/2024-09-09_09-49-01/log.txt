# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

[09/09/2024 09:49:06 AM] To create a path that satisfies the given requirements, we can plan a route that begins in the start set, passes through one breakpoint, avoids all obstacles, and ends in the goal set. Here's a possible path:

### Path Plan

1. **Starting Point:** Choose a point within the blue start set. For simplicity, pick somewhere near the top, like (0.5, 0.5).
   
2. **Move to Breakpoint:** Go to one of the available breakpoints, such as (2.0, 1.5). This will avoid the first obstacle underneath the start set.

3. **Navigate Around Obstacles:** From the breakpoint, move up to clear the obstacle at (3.0, 4.0). To stay clear, go to (3.0, 5.0).

4. **Enter Goal Set:** Finally, move towards the goal area. Enter the green goal set near the top, like (4.5, 4.5). 

### Resulting Path

The waypoints for this path are:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (2.0, 1.5),    # Move to a breakpoint
    (3.0, 5.0),    # Navigate around obstacles
    (4.5, 4.5)     # End within the goal set
]
```

This path ensures the starting and ending conditions are met while avoiding all defined obstacles and touching a breakpoint.

[09/09/2024 09:49:13 AM] **Analyzing the Path and Environment:**

1. **Start and End Points:**
   - The path correctly begins within the start set at (0.5, 0.5) and ends within the goal set at (4.5, 4.5).

2. **Obstacles Analysis:**
   - The provided path segment from (2.0, 1.5) to (3.0, 5.0) crosses through Obstacle 2, which spans from x-coordinates -2.0 to 3.0 and y-coordinates 2.0 to 4.0.

3. **Valid Subpath:**
   - The path segment from (0.5, 0.5) to (2.0, 1.5) is valid as it avoids obstacles.

**Adjusting the Path:**

1. **Avoiding Obstacle 2:**
   - Since the path crosses Obstacle 2, we must select a waypoint that navigates around it.

2. **New Path Strategy:**
   - From (2.0, 1.5), move upwards until outside the obstacle range, and then plot a course toward the goal set.

3. **Revised Pathway:**
   - Starting from the valid subpath and adjusting further waypoints while maintaining the end point in the goal set.

**New Path Plan:**

- Start at (0.5, 0.5)
- Move to (2.0, 1.5) [Within valid subpath]
- Navigate upwards to clear Obstacle 2: (2.0, 4.5)
- Approach the goal set from a safe angle: (3.5, 4.5)
- End at (4.5, 4.5)

**Final Path:**

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),     # Start
    (2.0, 1.5),     # Move to a breakpoint while avoiding initial obstacles
    (2.0, 4.5),     # Navigate upward to bypass Obstacle 2
    (3.5, 4.5),     # Move horizontally toward the goal set safely
    (4.5, 4.5)      # End at the goal set
]
```

This revised pathway ensures that no segment of the path crosses any obstacles, maintaining clearances around all intersections with obstacles.

[09/09/2024 09:49:21 AM] **Analysis and Adjustments:**

1. **Starting and Ending Points:**
   - The path starts correctly at (0.5, 0.5) in the start set and ends at (4.5, 4.5) in the goal set.

2. **Intersection with Obstacles:**
   - The segment from (2.0, 1.5) to (2.0, 4.5) intersects with Obstacle 2. We need to adjust this segment to avoid the obstacle.

3. **Valid Subpath:**
   - Up to (2.0, 1.5), the path is valid. Starting from here, we need to find an alternative route.

4. **Obstacle Avoidance Strategy:**
   - From (2.0, 1.5), move vertically a bit upwards, then horizontally around the upper perimeter of Obstacle 2, and finally, to the goal set.

5. **Adjusting the Path:**
   - Consider a detour around Obstacle 2 to the east by utilizing the open space above the obstacle.

**New Path:**

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),     # Start in the start set
    (2.0, 1.5),     # First valid waypoint, utilize breakpoint
    (2.5, 5.0),     # Move upwards to bypass the obstacle
    (3.5, 5.0),     # Navigate right over the obstacle
    (4.5, 4.5)      # End in the goal set
]
```

- This path now avoids intersecting with any obstacles and complies with the requirement to pass through a breakpoint while starting and ending in the correct sets.

[09/09/2024 09:49:29 AM] To adjust the path so it avoids obstacles and fulfills all conditions, let's analyze the spatial relationships and make necessary changes.

### Spatial Analysis
1. **Start and Goal Area**:
   - The start set is in the bottom-left quadrant.
   - The goal set is in the top-right quadrant.
   
2. **Obstacles**:
   - **Obstacle 1** is located between the start and goal set but positioned more towards the bottom.
   - **Obstacle 2** stretches horizontally between the quadrants at a higher y-coordinate range (around y=2 to y=4).

3. **Breakpoints**:
   - The only breakpoint your path currently passes through is (2.0, 1.5), which is near the bottom edge of Obstacle 2.

### Path Adjustment
To avoid crossing Obstacle 2 and still move between the start and goal set, the path should be adjusted to pass above Obstacle 2.

### Solution Path
1. **Start**: Begin closer to the middle-bottom of the start set at (0.5, 0.5).
2. **First Breakpoint**: Head towards (2.0, 1.5), which stays clear of Obstacle 1.
3. **Path Adjustment**:
   - Instead of heading directly to the goal, move upwards to a new waypoint (2.0, 4.5) to avoid intersecting Obstacle 2 and pass above it.
4. **Approach Goal**: Continue from (2.0, 4.5) to (4.5, 4.5), ensuring it stays clear of the top of Obstacle 2.
5. **Finish**: Finally reach the endpoint within the goal set at (4.5, 4.5).

### New Path
The revised path that avoids obstacles is:
```python
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # start in the start set
    (2.0, 1.5),   # move to the first breakpoint
    (2.0, 4.5),   # new waypoint to avoid obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)    # endpoint within the goal set
]
```

This new path satisfies all conditions by starting in the start set, going through a valid breakpoint, avoiding obstacles, and ending in the goal set.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.

### Original Path
- Start: (0.5, 0.5) – Correctly within the start set.
- End: (4.5, 4.5) – Correctly within the goal set.
- Problematic Segment: The path segment between (2.0, 1.5) and (2.0, 4.5) intersects Obstacle 2.

### Obstacle Avoidance
- **Current Issue:** The vertical segment between (2.0, 1.5) and (2.0, 4.5) is intersecting with Obstacle 2.

### Strategy for Correction
1. **Waypoint Adjustment:**
   - Use the valid subpath [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, 1.5)].
   - From (2.0, 1.5), adjust the path to avoid the obstacle and maintain clearance.

2. **Updated Waypoints:**
   - **Adjustment:** Move slightly to the right and maintain a clear path around Obstacle 2.
   - **Clearance Pathway:** Add a waypoint at (3.0, 1.5) to move around the right side of Obstacle 2, then move vertically upwards to the clear height past the obstacle at (3.0, 4.5).

3. **Final Segment:**
   - Continue from (3.0, 4.5) to the goal at (4.5, 4.5) while avoiding obstacles.

### New Path Proposal
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start in the start set
    (2.0, 1.5),    # First breakpoint
    (3.0, 1.5),    # By-pass Obstacle 2 on the right
    (3.0, 4.5),    # Move vertically past the obstacle
    (4.5, 4.5)     # End in the goal set
]
```

### Final Verification
- The path begins in the starting set and ends in the goal set.
- The revised segments maintain a safe distance from both obstacles.
- The path passes through one of the breakpoints, ensuring compliance with the requirements.

[09/09/2024 09:49:42 AM] To adjust the path while avoiding obstacles, let's analyze the valid sections and reroute around the problematic area.

### Analysis

1. **Valid Segment**:
   - The path starts at (0.5, 0.5) in the start set and moves validly towards (2.0, 1.5).

2. **Problematic Segment**:
   - The segment from (3.0, 1.5) to (3.0, 4.5) intersects Obstacle 2.

3. **Obstacle Avoidance**:
   - To bypass the obstacles, we need to add a waypoint that skirts around Obstacle 2.

4. **Breakpoints**:
   - We are already passing through a breakpoint (2.0, 1.5).

### Proposed Path Adjustment

- **New Waypoint**: Insert a waypoint at (3.0, 1.8) to navigate around the edge of Obstacle 2.

### New Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),      # start in the start set
    (2.0, 1.5),      # valid segment, through a breakpoint
    (3.0, 1.8),      # new waypoint to avoid obstacle
    (3.5, 2.5),      # continue slightly upwards
    (3.5, 4.5),      # move vertically near goal set
    (4.5, 4.5)       # end in the goal set
]
```

### Explanation

- The path is adjusted to include a waypoint that moves slightly around Obstacle 2, avoiding intersection.
- The new waypoint at (3.0, 1.8) is carefully placed to maintain distance from the obstacle while proceeding towards the goal.
- The final segment moves vertically close to the obstacle’s boundary but respects the non-crossing condition.

This revised path should meet all requirements while effectively avoiding obstacles.
