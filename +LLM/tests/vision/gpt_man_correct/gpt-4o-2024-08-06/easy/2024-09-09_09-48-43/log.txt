# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 1.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

[09/09/2024 09:48:52 AM] To create a path from the start position to the goal position while avoiding obstacles, follow these steps:

### Start and Goal Positions
- **Start Quadrilateral:** Choose a point inside, such as (0.5, 0.5).
- **Goal Quadrilateral:** Choose a point inside, such as (4.5, 4.5).

### Plan Path
1. **Start Point:** Begin at (0.5, 0.5) within the start quadrilateral.
2. **Pass Breakpoint:** Use the breakpoint (2.0, 1.5).
3. **Navigate Around Obstacles:** 
   - Move to (2.0, 3.5) to go above Obstacle 1.
   - Continue to (3.0, 3.5) to follow the gap between the obstacles.
4. **Reach Goal Point:** End at (4.5, 4.5) within the goal quadrilateral.

### Ensure Safe Distance from Obstacles
- Stay clear by maintaining a safe distance from all obstacle boundaries.

### New Path:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),      # Start
    (2.0, 1.5),      # Breakpoint
    (2.0, 3.5),      # Above Obstacle 1
    (3.0, 3.5),      # Move right in the gap
    (4.5, 4.5)       # Goal
]
```

This path ensures you pass through a breakpoint and avoid all obstacles while reaching from the start to the goal.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

[09/09/2024 09:49:00 AM] ## Analysis

1. **Start and End Positions**: The path correctly starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.

2. **Obstacle Crossing**: The issue arises with the segment from (2.0, 1.5) to (2.0, 3.5), which crosses Obstacle 2. We need to adjust this segment to avoid the obstacle.

3. **Valid Subpath**: The longest valid subpath is from (0.5, 0.5) to (2.0, 1.5).

## Strategy

1. **Continue from the Valid Subpath**: We start from (2.0, 1.5) and need to choose a new waypoint that avoids the obstacle while moving towards the goal.

2. **Obstacle Configuration**: Obstacle 2 occupies the area from [-2.0, 4.0] to [3.0, 2.0]. Navigating around this obstacle without crossing involves moving to the right or above.

3. **Find a Detour**: 
   - From (2.0, 1.5), proceed to the right, bypassing the obstacle above or around its boundary.
   - Introduce a waypoint before reaching (3.0, 3.5) to avoid crossing back through the obstacle.

4. **End in the Goal Set**: Ensure the final segment reaches within the goal area.

## New Path Proposal

1. **Start**: (0.5, 0.5) - Starting within the start set.
2. **Waypoint**: (2.0, 1.5) - Reaching the breakpoint, valid so far.
3. **Detour**: (2.5, 1.7) - Slight move to avoid crossing directly into the obstacle.
4. **Bypass**: (3.5, 1.7) - Continue further right.
5. **Forward**: (3.5, 4.0) - Move up beyond the obstacle.
6. **Towards Goal**: (4.5, 4.5) - Steering towards and into the goal.

## Resulting Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (2.0, 1.5),
    (2.5, 1.7),
    (3.5, 1.7),
    (3.5, 4.0),
    (4.5, 4.5)
]
```

This new path maintains the start and end conditions while circumventing the obstacle effectively.
