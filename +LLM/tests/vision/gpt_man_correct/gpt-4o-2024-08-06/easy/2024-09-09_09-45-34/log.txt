# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 1.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

[09/09/2024 09:45:39 AM] To create a path avoiding obstacles and meeting all requirements, you can consider the following waypoints:

### Path Analysis
1. **Start within the Start Set:** Choose a point well within the blue start set, for instance, (0.5, 0.5).
2. **Pass through a Breakpoint:** Use the breakpoint (2.0, 1.5) to ensure safe navigation through the environment while avoiding obstacles.
3. **Navigate around Obstacles:**
   - Move towards (2.0, 4.5) to safely circumvent the upper side of the first obstacle.
   - Adjust the path to pass through the y-axis at a point above the obstacle.
4. **Reach the Goal Set:** Conclude at a point within the green goal set, for example, (4.5, 4.5).

### New Path
The waypoints for a path satisfying all the criteria could be:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start in the start set
    (2.0, 1.5),   # Pass through Breakpoint Set 1
    (2.0, 4.5),   # Navigate above the first obstacle
    (4.5, 4.5)    # End in the goal set
]
```

This path ensures the criteria are met, maintaining a safe distance from the obstacles while passing through specified breakpoints and areas.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[09/09/2024 09:45:48 AM] ### Path Adjustment Analysis

1. **Start and End Criteria:**
   - The path correctly starts within the blue start area and ends in the green goal area.

2. **Obstacle Intersections:**
   - The main problem with the original path is the segment between (2.0, 1.5) and (2.0, 4.5), which intersects with Obstacle 2.

3. **Breakpoint Usage:**
   - The path currently uses the breakpoint (2.0, 1.5) successfully but needs adjustment to avoid obstacles while ensuring at least one breakpoint is included.

### Spatial Analysis

- **Obstacle 1** is below the initial part of the path and does not interfere.
- **Obstacle 2** is intersected by the vertical segment (2.0, 1.5) to (2.0, 4.5).

### Path Adjustment Steps

1. **Modify the problematic segment:**
   - Instead of going vertically from (2.0, 1.5) to (2.0, 4.5), we can add a waypoint that circumvents Obstacle 2.

2. **New Waypoint Addition:**
   - Add a waypoint to move horizontally away from the obstacle before moving vertically again.

### Proposed New Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start within the start area
    (2.0, 1.5),   # Pass through the first breakpoint
    (2.0, 1.8),   # Move slightly upwards to clear the obstacle boundary
    (3.5, 1.8),   # Move right to bypass Obstacle 2
    (3.5, 4.5),   # Move upwards outside the right boundary of Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)    # End in the goal set
]
```

### Conclusion

By sidestepping slightly to the right of the obstacle before continuing upwards, we maintain clearance from obstacles and respect breakpoint criteria. This adjusted path should avoid intersections while fulfilling all requirements.
