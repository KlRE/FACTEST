# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 1.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.

[09/09/2024 09:40:12 AM] To construct a path that avoids obstacles while starting from the start set and ending in the goal set, hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

### Analysis of the Environment:

- **Start Set:** A quadrilateral located at the bottom left.
- **Goal Set:** A quadrilateral located at the top right.
- **Obstacles:**
  - **Obstacle 1:** Placed horizontally above the start set.
  - **Obstacle 2:** Placed vertically overlapping the middle of the environment.

### Path Planning:

1. **Start Point:** Select a point inside the start set, e.g., (0.5, 0.5).

2. **Waypoint through the first breakpoint:** Choose a waypoint to avoid obstacle 1 and navigate upwards to pass through a breakpoint.
    - Opt for breakpoint (2.0, 1.5) as it lets you move upwards without colliding with Obstacle 1.
  
3. **Navigate around Obstacle 2:** 
    - Move towards another point above Obstacle 2, e.g., (2.0, 3.5).

4. **Waypoint through the goal set:** 
    - Pass through a suitable point, e.g., (4.5, 4.5), ensuring you navigate to the inside of the goal set.

### Path:

Constructing a smooth path that adheres to the above logic:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),     # Start point within the start set
    (2.0, 1.5),     # Pass through the chosen breakpoint above Obstacle 1
    (2.0, 3.5),     # Move upwards to clear Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)      # End point within the goal set
]
```

### Conclusion:

This path respects all given conditions:
- Begins inside the start set.
- Ends inside the goal set.
- Passes through the required breakpoints, avoiding the path intersection with any obstacles.
- Maintains a safe distance from the obstacles.

[09/09/2024 09:40:20 AM] ### Analysis

1. **Start and Goal Sets:**
   - The path starts within the defined start quadrilateral and ends in the goal quadrilateral.

2. **Obstacle Intersection:**
   - The segment between (2.0, 1.5) and (2.0, 3.5) crosses Obstacle 2.

3. **Breakpoints:**
   - The current path uses a valid breakpoint (2.0, 1.5).

### Obstacle Avoidance

- **Obstacle 1:** Positioned between x = 2.0 and x = 4.0 along y = 0.0 to y = 1.0.
- **Obstacle 2:** Extends from x = -2.0 to x = 3.0 between y = 2.0 and y = 4.0.

### Path Adjustment

Since the segment (2.0, 1.5) to (2.0, 3.5) intersects Obstacle 2, we need to adjust the path to avoid it. Here's an updated path:

### New Path

1. **Start:** Begin at (0.5, 0.5).
2. **Move to Breakpoint 1:** (2.0, 1.5) - pass through the valid breakpoint.
3. **Adjust Path to Avoid Obstacle 2:**
   - Instead of (2.0, 3.5), we'll navigate around Obstacle 2 starting at (2.0, 1.5):
   - Move upwards and slightly to the right: (2.5, 1.5)
   - Move vertically upwards on the right side to (2.5, 4.5)
4. **Proceed to Goal:**
   - Move directly to the endpoint at (4.5, 4.5) in the goal set.

### Final Path

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),     # Start within start set
    (2.0, 1.5),     # Valid breakpoint
    (2.5, 1.5),     # Move slightly right along y = 1.5
    (2.5, 4.5),     # Move upwards avoiding Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)      # End within the goal set
] 

This path avoids intersecting with both obstacles while meeting the path requirements.

[09/09/2024 09:40:26 AM] To correct the path given the constraints:

1. **Start and End Sets**:
   - The path correctly starts within the start set and ends within the goal set.

2. **Obstacle Analysis**:
   - The problematic segment is between waypoints (2.5, 1.5) and (2.5, 4.5), which intersects with Obstacle 2.

3. **Adjusting Path**:
   - We need to adjust the path to go around Obstacle 2 while ensuring we pass through a breakpoint.

4. **Strategy**:
   - Since (2.0, 1.5) is a breakpoint, we'll maintain that point.
   - To avoid Obstacle 2, we can create a new waypoint that routes around the obstacle above it.

5. **New Path Proposal**:
   - Start at (0.5, 0.5).
   - Move to (2.0, 1.5) to pass through the breakpoint.
   - Adjust upwards to avoid the obstacle, then move to (2.0, 5.0) to bypass it, using the upper space.
   - Finally, navigate to the goal at (4.5, 4.5).

The proposed path avoids the obstacles and meets the conditions.

new_path = [

[09/09/2024 09:40:36 AM] To create a path that satisfies all requirements, let's analyze the initial path and identify adjustments needed to avoid the obstacles successfully.

### Analysis

1. **Initial Path and Issues:**
   - The path begins correctly at (0.5, 0.5) within the start set.
   - It uses a breakpoint (2.0, 1.5) but then proceeds to (2.0, 5.0), which causes the path to intersect with Obstacle 2. The feedback provided indicates this as the problematic segment.

2. **Obstacle Layout:**
   - Obstacle 1 is to the right of the start set, spanning (2.0, 0.0) to (4.0, 1.0).
   - Obstacle 2 covers a range from (-2.0, 2.0) to (3.0, 4.0), blocking a direct vertical path from the start checkpoint.

3. **Valid Subpath:**
   - The valid segment given is [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, 1.5)], which suggests this portion does not intersect any obstacles.

### Path Adjustments

To construct a successful path while avoiding obstacles:

1. **Avoid Obstacle 2:**
   - Starting from the valid segment endpoint (2.0, 1.5), adjust the path to bypass Obstacle 2 by moving around it.

2. **Path Suggestion:**
   - New path to avoid obstacles while using breakpoints effectively could be:
     - Start at (0.5, 0.5), move to breakpoint (2.0, 1.5).
     - From (2.0, 1.5), move slightly to the right and upward, e.g., (2.5, 1.5) to avoid the lower edge of Obstacle 2.
     - Continue upward past Obstacle 2 using a safe distanceâ€”adjust to (2.5, 4.5).
     - Finally, proceed to (4.5, 4.5) to reach the goal.

### New Path Proposal

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # start point
    (2.0, 1.5),  # valid breakpoint
    (2.5, 1.5),  # adjusted around Obstacle 2
    (2.5, 4.5),  # move above Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)   # endpoint in goal set
]

This path introduces subtle movements to evade obstacles while maintaining compliance with set requirements.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data

[09/09/2024 09:40:45 AM] To correct the path and ensure it avoids obstacles, let's analyze the current situation:

### Key Observations:
1. **Start and End Sets**: The path begins correctly in the start set at (0.5, 0.5) and ends in the goal set at (4.5, 4.5).

2. **Obstacle Intersections**:
   - The path from (2.5, 1.5) to (2.5, 4.5) intersects with Obstacle 2.

3. **Valid Subpath**:
   - The longest valid subpath is from (0.5, 0.5) to (2.5, 1.5).

### Path Adjustment Strategy:
To avoid Obstacle 2, we need to reroute the path between the waypoints (2.5, 1.5) and (2.5, 4.5).

### New Path Proposal:
1. Start from (0.5, 0.5).
2. Move to the first breakpoint (2.0, 1.5), which is part of a valid segment.
3. **Detour**: Instead of heading straight up to (2.5, 4.5), we can add a new waypoint to navigate around Obstacle 2.
   - Move horizontally towards (3.5, 1.5) to stay clear of Obstacle 2's vertical boundary.
   - Move vertically up to (3.5, 4.5) to avoid the obstacle.
4. Finally, proceed to the goal at (4.5, 4.5).

This adjustment will ensure the path avoids intersections while staying within the confines of the start and goal sets.

### New Path:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start in the start set
    (2.0, 1.5),  # First breakpoint, within valid subpath
    (3.5, 1.5),  # Horizontal detour to avoid obstacle
    (3.5, 4.5),  # Vertical move avoiding the obstacle
    (4.5, 4.5)   # End in the goal set
]
```

By following this adjusted route, the path successfully avoids the obstacles and meets the given requirements.
