# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[16.9, 14.5], [18.0, 12.3], [17.9, 17.6], [17.7, 18.6]]
			Obstacle 2: [[6.5, 19.2], [6.6, 15.8], [13.7, 17.8], [13.0, 19.2]]
			Obstacle 3: [[16.0, 18.9], [16.6, 7.2], [17.4, 7.0], [17.1, 10.9]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 7.24), (9.0, 20.6)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

[09/09/2024 03:03:34 PM] To create a path that meets all the requirements, we need to choose waypoints that allow us to navigate from the start set to the goal set while avoiding obstacles and passing through the required breakpoints.

### Analysis:
1. **Start and Goal Areas:**
   - Start inside the start quadrilateral (e.g., (1.0, 1.0)).
   - End inside the goal quadrilateral (e.g., (19.0, 19.0)).

2. **Avoid Obstacles:**
   - Navigate around the three given obstacle quadrilaterals.

3. **Breakpoints:**
   - Use one of the provided breakpoints. I'll choose (9.0, 7.24).

### Proposed Path:
- Start from a point within the start set, e.g., (1.0, 1.0).
- Move up to the chosen breakpoint (9.0, 7.24).
- Navigate around the obstacles to a point near the goal but clear of obstacles before heading directly to the goal.
- Ensure no lines cross or touch the obstacles.

### Path:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start in the start set
    (9.0, 7.24),     # Pass through the breakpoint
    (15.0, 16.0),    # Navigate between obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)     # End in the goal set
]
```

This path should ensure starting and ending in the correct sets, passing through a breakpoint, and avoiding obstacles. Adjustments can be made for precise navigation based on obstacle proximity.

[09/09/2024 03:03:43 PM] ## Analysis

### Issues with Current Path:
- The path segment from (15.0, 16.0) to (19.0, 19.0) intersects with Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3.

### New Path Strategy:
1. **Avoiding Obstacle Intersection**: Shift the problematic segment to navigate around the obstacles more effectively.
2. **Maintaining Breakpoints**: Ensure the path passes through at least one breakpoint.
3. **Start and End Compliance**: Start in the start set and end in the goal set correctly.

## Adjusted Path Proposal:

### Steps for Adjustment:
- Start at point (1.0, 1.0) which is inside the start set.
- Move to the first breakpoint (9.0, 7.24).
- Redirect the segment to avoid obstacles and approach the goal set by adding a waypoint near the upper boundary of the obstacles.
- End at a point inside the goal set.

### New Waypoints:
- (1.0, 1.0) → Starting point within the start set.
- (9.0, 7.24) → Pass through the first breakpoint.
- Add a waypoint like (14.0, 18.0) to navigate around obstacles.
- (19.0, 19.5) → Ending point within the goal set.

## Proposed New Path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 7.24),
    (14.0, 18.0),
    (19.0, 19.5)
]
```

### Explanation:
- **(1.0, 1.0) to (9.0, 7.24)**: This keeps the start and first segment valid.
- **(9.0, 7.24) to (14.0, 18.0)**: This redirect should bypass Obstacle 1 by a safe margin.
- **(14.0, 18.0) to (19.0, 19.5)**: This segment heads towards the goal, avoiding intersections with the obstacles.

By adjusting the path as described, we maintain compliance with all requirements and successfully avoid obstacles.

[09/09/2024 03:04:11 PM] ### Analysis and Path Adjustment

#### Current Path Issues
The problematic segment in the current path is between (14.0, 18.0) and (19.0, 19.5), where it intersects with Obstacle 3. We need to reroute this final segment to avoid the obstacle.

#### Path Rerouting Strategy
1. **Start and Initial Segments:** The path correctly starts at (1.0, 1.0) and passes through the first breakpoint (9.0, 7.24). It continues safely to the point (14.0, 18.0) without intersecting any obstacles.
2. **Avoid Obstacle 3:** Since the current path intersects with Obstacle 3 at the final segment, we need to maneuver around it. We'll try to go around the obstacle by approaching closer to its boundaries without crossing.
3. **Final Path to Goal:** Ensure that the path ends within the green goal quadrant.

#### New Path Proposal
Let's alter the path after the point (14.0, 18.0):

1. Start at (1.0, 1.0).
2. Move to breakpoint (9.0, 7.24).
3. Continue to (14.0, 18.0) — safe point thus far.
4. Add a new waypoint to steer clear of Obstacle 3:
   - Move to (16.0, 19.0) to bypass Obstacle 3 to the left, rounding its upper edge.
5. Proceed to goal point (19.2, 19.6) to safely end within the goal set. This subtle shift ensures full clearance from Obstacle 3.

### New Path
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),       # Start in the start set
    (9.0, 7.24),      # First breakpoint
    (14.0, 18.0),     # Continue safely
    (16.0, 19.0),     # Additional waypoint to avoid Obstacle 3
    (19.2, 19.6)      # Endpoint in the green goal set
]
```

This adjusted path respects all requirements by staying clear of obstacles and ending correctly in the goal set while maintaining a valid sequence through required waypoints.
