# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.9, 14.3], [15.6, 6.0], [16.0, 3.9], [19.0, 3.3]]

[09/09/2024 03:26:14 PM] To create a path that starts in the start set, passes through one waypoint in each breakpoint set, avoids obstacles, and ends in the goal set:

1. **Choose a Start Point**: Select a point within the blue start set. Let's choose (1.0, 1.0).

2. **Pick a Breakpoint from Set 1**: Choose a point from the breakpoint set. Let's go with (9.0, 7.0).

3. **Navigate through Breakpoint Set 2**: Plan a route to the second set of breakpoints, for instance, (9.0, 19.61).

4. **Choose an End Point**: Finally, select a point within the green goal set, such as (19.0, 19.0).

Make sure to avoid obstacles by positioning waypoints carefully. The path should pass to the right or left of the current obstacles to stay clear.

Hereâ€™s a potential path:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start in the start set
    (9.0, 7.0),    # Pass through a breakpoint from set 1
    (9.0, 19.61),  # Pass through a breakpoint from set 2
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End in the goal set
]
```

This path ensures a clear trajectory through the environment while avoiding obstacles. Adjust the waypoints as needed to maintain a safe distance, ensuring no obstacles are touched or intersected.

[09/09/2024 03:26:24 PM] To correct the path so it avoids intersecting obstacle 3, we need to make some adjustments. The current path between \((9.0, 7.0)\) and \((9.0, 19.61)\) intersects with obstacle 3. Let's modify the path:

### Analysis
- **Start Point:** We have a valid start from \((1.0, 1.0)\).
- **Avoiding Obstacle 3:** The straight vertical line from \((9.0, 7.0)\) to \((9.0, 19.61)\) passes through obstacle 3. We need to route around it.

### Path Adjustment
1. **Continue to the Valid Subpath:** Start from \((1.0, 1.0)\) to \((9.0, 7.0)\).
2. **Avoid Obstacle 3:**
   - Move from \((9.0, 7.0)\) slightly to the right to avoid obstacle 3, by choosing a point like \((12.0, 7.0)\).
   - Then move upwards to \((12.0, 17.0)\).
   - Finally, move towards the goal, \((19.0, 19.0)\), by proceeding to a point like \((19.0, 19.0)\).

### New Path
With these considerations, the revised path is:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start point in the valid area
    (9.0, 7.0),     # First breakpoint
    (12.0, 7.0),    # Move around obstacle 3 to the right
    (12.0, 17.0),   # Move upwards avoiding obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End point in the goal set
]
```

This path maintains a logical flow from the start to the goal while avoiding obstacles and using the breakpoints effectively.

[09/09/2024 03:26:36 PM] ## Thought Process

1. **Identify the Issue**:
   - The path correctly starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
   - The segment between (12.0, 7.0) and (12.0, 17.0) intersects with Obstacle 3.

2. **Spatial Relationships**:
   - Obstacle 3 extends horizontally around the segment causing the intersection.
   - The valid part of the path is from (1.0, 1.0) to (12.0, 7.0).

3. **Path Adjustments**:
   - We need to find a way around Obstacle 3.
   - Adjust the path to steer clear of the known obstacle while still reaching a breakpoint.

4. **Waypoint Strategy**:
   - Utilize the valid subpath already identified.
   - Identify potential waypoints around Obstacle 3 and other obstacles.

## Revised Path Proposal

1. Start from (1.0, 1.0) â€“ within the start set.
2. Move to Breakpoint (9.0, 7.0).
3. Move slightly upwards and rightward to avoid crossing Obstacle 3: (11.5, 9.0).
4. Move further up to (12.0, 15.0) to safely bypass Obstacle 3.
5. From there, move to the final destination within the goal set at (19.0, 19.0).

## New Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 7.0),
    (11.5, 9.0),
    (12.0, 15.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
``` 

This revised path avoids crossing into obstacles and finishes within the goal set while satisfying all waypoint requirements.

[09/09/2024 03:26:43 PM] To adjust the path and avoid obstacles, we need to address the segment from point (12.0, 15.0) to (19.0, 19.0) as it intersects with Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3.

### Analysis:
1. **Valid Subpath:** The path up to (12.0, 15.0) is valid.
2. **Obstacle Intersections:** The original path intersects with both Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3. The area between (12.0, 15.0) and (19.0, 19.0) needs adjusting.

### Strategy for Adjusting the Path:
- We can navigate around the obstacles by adding an intermediate waypoint that safely bypasses these obstacles.
- Consider the spatial clearance around Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3.
- A potential path could deviate northward around Obstacle 3 before heading towards the goal.

### Revised Path Proposal:
1. **Adjust Path After (12.0, 15.0):**
   - From (12.0, 15.0), navigate around the top of Obstacle 3.
   - Add a waypoint to skirt both obstacles.

### New Path:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start
    (9.0, 7.0),     # Valid Breakpoint from Set 1
    (11.5, 9.0),    # Continue the valid segment
    (12.0, 15.0),   # Current last valid waypoint
    (15.5, 17.5),   # New waypoint avoiding Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End in the goal set, slightly adjust to ensure clearance
]
```

### Explanation:
- The new waypoint (15.5, 17.5) is chosen based on visual estimation to move above the problematic obstacles and provide a clear path to the goal.
- Make sure to verify this new waypoint avoids any intersections when plotted in the actual scenario.

[09/09/2024 03:26:59 PM] To adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles while still satisfying all the requirements, let's consider the feedback and the spatial arrangement of the obstacles.

### Analyzing the Existing Path:
1. **Valid Subpath:** The path from `(1.0, 1.0)` to `(12.0, 15.0)` is valid.
2. **Issue Segment:** The segment `(12.0, 15.0)` to `(15.5, 17.5)` intersects Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3.

### Obstacles Analysis:
- **Obstacle 2** and **Obstacle 3** create a challenge around `(15.5, 17.5)`. The overlap indicates a need for a path that circumvents or goes through a clearer region.

### Strategy to Correct the Path:
- **Avoid the overlap region**: By rerouting the path to bypass overlapping areas.
- **Add intermediate waypoints** to ensure the path curves away from obstacles.

### Suggested Path:
- **Maintain the valid subpath** up to `(12.0, 15.0)`.
- **Reroute** around the overlap region with strategic waypoints.

### New Path:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 7.0),  # Breakpoint Set 1, maintain validity
    (11.5, 9.0),  # Continue on the valid path
    (12.0, 15.0),  # Point before intersection issues start
    (13.2, 16.5),  # New waypoint to navigate around obstacles
    (14.5, 18.0),  # Another waypoint to clear the overlap at (15.5, 17.5)
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set
]
```

### Explanation of Adjustments:
- **Added Waypoints `(13.2, 16.5)` and `(14.5, 18.0)`**: These waypoints navigate the path around the intersecting region of Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3. 
- **Clears Overlapping Region**: By carefully plotting through non-overlapping parts, it avoids crossing any obstacles while reaching the goal.

With these adjustments, the path should remain within valid areas and successfully connect the start and goal sets without intersection.

[09/09/2024 03:27:08 PM] ### Analysis

The current path successfully starts from the start set and ends in the goal set, but the segment between waypoints (12.0, 15.0) and (13.2, 16.5) intersects with Obstacle 3. Our task is to adjust the waypoints to avoid this obstacle while maintaining the general direction of the path.

### Obstacle Consideration

- **Obstacle 3**: The problematic segment crosses near the lower-right edge of this obstacle. We need to divert around it without touching.

### Adjustments

1. **Initial Segment**: Keep the start and the first few valid waypoints unchanged until (12.0, 15.0).

2. **Avoiding Obstacle 3**:
   - Adjust the path to pass below the edge of Obstacle 3 more clearly, avoiding the intersecting segment.
   - Instead of (13.2, 16.5), divert to a safer point before heading upwards.

3. **Alternative Path**:
   - Introduce a waypoint that goes slightly lower before returning to the vertical path to avoid Obstacle 3.
   - Ensure the new waypoint does not intersect other obstacles.

### New Path Proposal

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Starting point within start set
    (9.0, 7.0),      # First breakpoint
    (11.5, 9.0),     # Safe route
    (12.0, 15.0),    # Continue straight until obstacle avoidance needed
    (12.5, 15.5),    # Adjusted waypoint to steer clear of Obstacle 3
    (13.5, 17.0),    # Return back upwards safely
    (15.5, 17.5),    # Align with older path beyond the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)     # End point within goal set
]

This new path should successfully navigate through the environment while avoiding all given obstacles.
