# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[14.9, 18.4], [13.3, 11.5], [15.9, 16.0], [16.0, 17.7]]

[09/09/2024 03:27:15 PM] Given the environment and constraints, hereâ€™s a suggested path that satisfies all requirements:

1. **Start Point**: Choose a point within the start set, such as (1.0, 1.0).
2. **Waypoint through Breakpoint Set 1**: Choose (9.0, 11.81).
3. **Navigate around obstacles while keeping a safe distance**:
   - Move to (16.0, 15.0), avoiding obstacles by skirting around them cautiously.
4. **Waypoint through a section close to Breakpoints and avoid more obstacles**: 
   - Traverse to (18.5, 17.0).
5. **End Point in Goal Set**: Arrive at (19.0, 19.0) within the goal set.

Therefore, the waypoints for the path are:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start point within the start set
    (9.0, 11.81),    # Breakpoint 1
    (16.0, 15.0),    # Navigate past obstacles
    (18.5, 17.0),    # Close to Breakpoints while avoiding obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)     # End in the goal set
]
```

This path avoids the obstacles and passes through the specified breakpoints while meeting the starting and ending conditions.

[09/09/2024 03:27:24 PM] To adjust the provided path and avoid intersecting obstacles, we'll analyze the spatial relationships and make necessary adjustments.

1. **Starting and Valid Subpath:** 
   - The path correctly starts within the start set at (1.0, 1.0) and reaches a valid subpath endpoint at (9.0, 11.81), which is a breakpoint.

2. **Analyzing Obstacle Intersections:**
   - The segment from (9.0, 11.81) to (16.0, 15.0) intersects multiple obstacles (1, 3, and 4). We need to reroute this segment to avoid the obstacles.

3. **Adjustments for Obstacle Avoidance:**
   - Since segment 2 intersects with several obstacles, we need a waypoint that navigates around these regions. We can add a waypoint that steers clear of the identified obstacles' areas while ensuring a valid route.

4. **New Waypoints:**
   - From (9.0, 11.81), we can propose a path that moves further along the y-axis to avoid the dense concentration of obstacles.
   - Add a waypoint such as (11.0, 18.0), which goes above the obstacle 1 and obstacle 3 area while getting closer to the goal safely.
   - From (11.0, 18.0), adjust the path to go directly to the goal without intersecting obstacle 2, moving to (19.0, 19.0).

5. **Final Path:**
   Given the above adjustments, the new path should avoid obstacles effectively:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),         # Start in start set
    (9.0, 11.81),       # Valid breakpoint and part of the valid subpath
    (11.0, 18.0),       # New waypoint that avoids obstacles 1, 3, and 4
    (19.0, 19.0)        # End in goal set
]
```

This path respects the requirement to pass through a breakpoint, starts and ends at the specified sets, and avoids obstacle intersections.

[09/09/2024 03:27:38 PM] **Analysis and Path Adjustment**

1. **Start and Goal Sets:**
   - The start point (1.0, 1.0) is correctly within the start set.
   - The endpoint (19.0, 19.0) is within the goal set.

2. **Obstacle Intersections:**
   - The segment between (9.0, 11.81) and (11.0, 18.0) crosses obstacle 2, defined by the vertices [[6.8, 16.6], [17.8, 16.7], [17.2, 18.0], [10.9, 17.4]].

3. **Valid Subpath:**
   - The subpath [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 11.81)] is valid and does not intersect any obstacles.
   
4. **Path Adjustment Strategy:**
   - To avoid obstacle 2 while continuing from the valid subpath, we need to adjust the segment leading to the endpoint.
   - Use the breakpoints wisely to navigate around obstacles.

5. **Proposed New Path:**
   - Start at (1.0, 1.0)
   - Use a valid breakpoint to reroute around obstacle 2.
   - Add waypoint (9.0, 13.5) to ascend a bit higher, avoiding obstacle 2.
   - Pass through (9.0, 19.51), a valid breakpoint, and then route directly to the goal.

**New Path:**

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),         # Start in the start set
    (9.0, 11.81),       # First valid waypoint, continues from existing subpath
    (9.0, 13.5),        # New waypoint to avoid obstacle 2
    (9.0, 19.51),       # Adjusted breakpoint traversal
    (19.0, 19.0)        # End in the goal set

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data

[09/09/2024 03:27:45 PM] To construct a valid path, we need to analyze the spatial arrangement of obstacles and adjust the waypoints accordingly. The key issue with the previous path is that segment 3, between (9.0, 13.5) and (9.0, 19.51), intersects with Obstacle 2. Here's how we can adjust the path:

### Analysis and Adjustment Steps:

1. **Start from Valid Subpath:**

   The valid subpath is:
   - (1.0, 1.0) to (9.0, 11.81) to (9.0, 13.5)

2. **Bypass the Obstacle:**

   Instead of going directly from (9.0, 13.5) to (9.0, 19.51), we need to create a detour around Obstacle 2.

3. **Create a Bypass Route:**

   - From (9.0, 13.5), move slightly upwards and eastward to avoid Obstacle 2.
   - Consider bypassing from the east side of Obstacle 2, moving a bit further along the y-axis before adjusting back to the original trajectory.
   
4. **End in the Goal Set:**

   Ensure the path eventually reaches the goal within the specified boundary after bypassing the obstacle.

### Proposed New Path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),       # Start Point
    (9.0, 11.81),     # Pass through the breakpoint
    (9.0, 13.5),      # Continue upwards
    (11.0, 14.5),     # Move eastward to bypass Obstacle 2
    (17.5, 19.0),     # Curve back towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)      # End Point in the goal set
]
```

### Explanation:

- **Waypoint (11.0, 14.5):** Bypasses obstacle on the east side, moving diagonally up and to the right from (9.0, 13.5).
- **Waypoint (17.5, 19.0):** Smooths the curve back towards the goal, ensuring the path is outside the obstacle's bounding polygons.
- Ensure we move around obstacles with slight buffers to prevent any accidental intersections.

This path adheres to the requirements: starting and ending in respective sets, passing through a breakpoint, and maintaining a safe distance from obstacles.

[09/09/2024 03:27:56 PM] To correct the path and avoid intersecting with any obstacles, let's analyze the environment and make adjustments:

1. **Identify Current Issues:**
   - The segment from (11.0, 14.5) to (17.5, 19.0) intersects with Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2.
   
2. **Analyze Breakpoints:**
   - Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints, such as (9.0, 11.81), which has already been used successfully.

3. **Plan New Path Segments:**
   - Use the valid subpath: [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 11.81), (9.0, 13.5), (11.0, 14.5)].
   - From (11.0, 14.5), avoid moving into the obstacle-prone area.

4. **Path Adjustment Strategy:**
   - Instead of going towards (17.5, 19.0), try moving left and then upwards, keeping clear of the obstacle zones.
   - Adjust the path to skirt around Obstacle 2 and the other intersecting obstacles.

5. **Suggested Pathway:**
   - Continue upwards from (11.0, 14.5) to avoid the obstacles and then move towards the goal.

### New Path:
```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start in the start set
    (9.0, 11.81),   # Pass through the breakpoint
    (9.0, 13.5),    # Continue the valid segment
    (11.0, 14.5),   # Last valid point before adjustments
    (12.0, 17.0),   # Move upward-left to avoid obstacles
    (16.0, 17.5),   # Continue right staying above obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End in the goal set
]
```

- **Explanation:** The path moves upward and towards the right while avoiding problematic areas around the obstacles. This path should clear the identified obstacles while connecting the start to the goal through a valid path.

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/09/2024 03:28:03 PM] ### Analysis and Thought Process

1. **Start and Valid Subpath**: The path starts correctly within the start set and initially follows a segment up to (11.0, 14.5) without any obstacle crossing, passing through the breakpoint (9.0, 11.81) from the Breakpoint Set 1.

2. **Identifying the Issue**:
   - The segment from (11.0, 14.5) to (12.0, 17.0) intersects with Obstacle 2, making it invalid.

3. **Obstacle Avoidance Strategy**:
   - To avoid Obstacle 2, the path needs an alternative route from (11.0, 14.5) while maintaining clearance from the obstacle. 
   - One option could be to slightly adjust the path after (9.0, 11.81) before continuing, or finding another gap.

4. **Path Adjustment**:
   - Redirect the path upwards and around Obstacle 2, ensuring it stays within safe boundaries.

### Path Adjustments

1. **Starting Point**: Retain the initial segment which is valid.
2. **Redirect to Avoid Obstacles**:
   - From (11.0, 14.5), avoid heading directly upwards through the obstacle. Instead, navigate a bit around it.
   - Adjust the path upwards and slightly to the right to circumvent any intersection.

### New Path Proposal

Hereâ€™s an adjusted path addressing the obstacle intersection:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),        # Start, within the start set
    (9.0, 11.81),      # Breakpoint from Set 1
    (11.0, 14.5),      # Last valid point before obstacle
    (12.0, 15.5),      # Adjust right and slightly upward to avoid Obstacle 2
    (14.0, 16.0),      # Continue upwards and right
    (16.5, 17.2),      # Safely above obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)       # End within goal set
]
```

### Explanation

- **Waypoint Adjustment**: By detouring around the obstacle using additional waypoints, the path maintains clearance from any intersecting areas.
- **Continuation**: After avoiding the obstacle, continue towards the goal area, ensuring it ends within the specified goal set.

By implementing these adjustments, the new path ensures compliance with all requirements, circumventing the problem segment successfully.
