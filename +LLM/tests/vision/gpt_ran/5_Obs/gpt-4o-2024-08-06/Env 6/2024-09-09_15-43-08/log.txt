# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[10.2, 0.1], [13.8, 4.6], [13.6, 9.2], [12.3, 6.1]]
			Obstacle 2: [[7.5, 17.2], [0.2, 15.8], [3.3, 15.7], [10.6, 16.2]]
			Obstacle 3: [[0.1, 10.1], [12.9, 14.7], [8.6, 17.9], [0.3, 15.5]]
			Obstacle 4: [[11.6, 2.1], [16.5, 11.8], [16.1, 13.2], [14.6, 12.8]]
			Obstacle 5: [[0.7, 9.1], [4.0, 4.3], [7.8, 9.2], [7.7, 12.1]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 5.64), (9.0, 19.8)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[09/09/2024 03:43:16 PM] To create a path from the start to the goal while avoiding obstacles, consider the given constraints and analyze the image:

### Path Plan:

1. **Start Point**: Begin within the start set at a point like (1.0, 1.0), ensuring it is inside the blue quadrilateral.
2. **Waypoint 1**: Move to the first breakpoint in Set 1, (9.0, 5.64), ensuring this segment avoids obstacles.
3. **Waypoint 2**: Navigate to the second breakpoint in Set 1, (9.0, 19.8), maintaining a route that skirts around any obstacles.
4. **Goal Point**: Finally, move to within the goal set at a point such as (19.0, 19.0), making sure it's within the green quadrilateral.

### New Path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start in the start set
    (9.0, 5.64),   # First breakpoint from Set 1
    (9.0, 19.8),   # Second breakpoint from Set 1
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End in the goal set
]
```

### Considerations:

- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Ensure the path keeps a safe distance from all obstacles, especially between waypoints 1, 2, and the goal point.
- **Validation**: Check visually (from the image) that the path does not intersect any obstacles. Adjust waypoints slightly if needed to ensure clearance around obstacle edges.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[09/09/2024 03:43:23 PM] To correct the path, we'll analyze the obstacles and suggest an alternative route:

### Analysis

1. **Current Valid Subpath**: The path from the start point (1.0, 1.0) to (9.0, 5.64) is valid.
2. **Problematic Segment**: The segment from (9.0, 5.64) to (9.0, 19.8) intersects with Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3.
3. **Breakpoints**: The path must pass through one of the breakpoints.

### Adjustments

- **Avoid Intersection**: Since the vertical line at x=9.0 intersects with obstacles, we need to deviate from this line.
- **Navigate Around Obstacles**: We'll navigate around the obstacles, moving horizontally through a gap before reaching the goal set.

### New Path Proposal

- **Step 1**: Start from (1.0, 1.0).
- **Step 2**: Go to (9.0, 5.64) through the valid path.
- **Step 3**: Move rightwards to avoid intersections by reaching a safe point before going up: (10.5, 12.5), bypassing the obstacles vertically.
- **Step 4**: Vertically continue to (19.0, 19.0), which is inside the goal set.

### New Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 5.64),
    (10.5, 12.5),  # Added waypoint to route around obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point within goal set
]
```

This path should effectively avoid the problematic intersections by strategically navigating through the location of obstacles, while still ensuring the path passes through one of the breakpoints.
