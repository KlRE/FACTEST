# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]

[09/09/2024 03:39:43 PM] To create a path from the start set to the goal set while avoiding obstacles, we must ensure a clear path through the environment displayed in the image. Here's a suggested path based on the provided data:

### Path Analysis

1. **Start Set:** Begin from a point within the blue quadrilateral, say at (1.0, 1.0).

2. **Breakpoints:** Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints:
   - Choose a breakpoint in Set 1, e.g., (9.0, 5.68).

3. **Navigating Obstacles:** Carefully navigate around obstacles. From the start, head towards the breakpoint while avoiding obstacles.

4. **Goal Set:** End the path in the green quadrilateral. A suggested endpoint might be (19.0, 19.0).

### Suggested Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 5.68),   # Pass through the first breakpoint
    (11.0, 11.0),  # Navigate through a clear area between obstacles
    (15.0, 16.0),  # Continue towards the goal while avoiding obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set
]
```

### Path Justification

- **Start and End:** The path starts and ends within the specified quadrilaterals.
- **Breakpoints:** Passes through a chosen breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Positioned waypoints to avoid crossing or touching any obstacles while maintaining a clear distance.
- **Linearity:** The path connects waypoints linearly.

Always ensure that obstacles are maintained at a safe distance during any adjustments or refinements to the path.

[09/09/2024 03:39:52 PM] ### Analysis and Path Adjustment

**Current Path Evaluation:**
1. **Valid Segments:**
   - (1.0, 1.0) to (9.0, 5.68)
   - (9.0, 5.68) to (11.0, 11.0)

2. **Invalid Segment:**
   - (11.0, 11.0) to (15.0, 16.0) intersects with:
     - Obstacle 2
     - Obstacle 3

### Adjusting the Path:

Given the obstacles, we need to find a way around Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3 between (11.0, 11.0) and (15.0, 16.0).

1. **Continue from the last valid point:** Begin from (11.0, 11.0).
2. **Navigate around the obstacles:**
   - Move slightly upwards and to the right to avoid intersection with Obstacle 2.
   - Avoid Obstacle 3 by steering further right before heading upwards.
3. **Ensure passing through a breakpoint:** Safely navigate near a breakpoint while maintaining a collision-free path.

### New Path Suggestion:

1. Start at (1.0, 1.0).
2. Move to (9.0, 5.68) passing through the firbreakpoint.
3. Continue to (11.0, 11.0).
4. Adjust to move around obstacles: (12.5, 13.5) to detour around the bottom edges of Obstacle 2 and 3.
5. Complete the path towards the goal: (18.5, 18.5), ensuring it ends within the goal area.

### Proposed Path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),          # Start in start set
    (9.0, 5.68),         # First breakpoint
    (11.0, 11.0),        # Continuing valid path
    (12.5, 13.5),        # Detour around obstacles
    (18.5, 18.5)         # End within goal set
]
```

This path adjusts the segments to avoid conflicts with obstacles while staying within guidelines for starting and ending in the correct regions and passing through the designated breakpoints.

[09/09/2024 03:39:59 PM] To create a valid path avoiding all obstacles and fulfilling the requirements, we need to make adjustments to the previous path. Let's analyze and explain the corrections:

1. **Start**: The path correctly starts at (1.0, 1.0) within the start set.

2. **Breakpoint**: The path goes through (9.0, 5.68), a valid breakpoint, so this portion of the path remains valid.

3. **Problem Area**: The segment from (11.0, 11.0) to (12.5, 13.5) intersects with Obstacle 3. We need to reroute this segment.

4. **Obstacle Avoidance Strategy**:
   - To avoid intersecting Obstacle 3, we'll direct the path around/between obstacles without crossing them. We should try to create a path that zigzags around the complex arrangement of obstacles.

5. **New Path Strategy**:
   - Move past the valid subpath to somewhere near (11.0, 11.0), then maneuver between the obstacles, maintaining a reasonable distance to avoid intersection.

6. **End**: Finish the path in the goal set, making sure to avoid any obstacles even at the endpoint.

Based on this analysis, we'll adjust waypoints for a correction:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),       # Start in start set
    (9.0, 5.68),      # Valid breakpoint
    (10.5, 10.0),     # Bypass to avoid obstacles, go upward to avoid Obstacle 3
    (11.5, 14.0),     # Curve between obstacles
    (17.0, 17.5),     # Navigate around, making sure to avoid intersection
    (18.5, 18.5)      # End in goal set
]
```

This path should navigate around the obstacle 3 while ensuring the path is clear of other obstacles, providing a smooth passage from start to goal.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data

[09/09/2024 03:40:17 PM] ### Analysis and Thought Process

1. **Initial Path Review**:
   - The path starts at (1.0, 1.0) within the start set and ends at (18.5, 18.5) within the goal set.
   - The third segment from (10.5, 10.0) to (11.5, 14.0) intersects with Obstacle 3.
   - The valid subpath so far is [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 5.68), (10.5, 10.0)].

2. **Obstacle 3 Analysis**:
   - Obstacle 3 spans positions from around (9.4, 15.1) to (19.5, 15.8).
   - The current segment (10.5, 10.0) to (11.5, 14.0) cuts through this area, causing a conflict.

3. **Adjustments**:
   - To bypass Obstacle 3, we can try moving the path upwards along the y-axis between obstacles 1 and 3, then move to the right.

4. **Path Re-alignment**:
   - Start at the break point (9.0, 5.68).
   - Move to avoid collision: travel upwards to around (11.5, 10.0), which is a safer approach.
   - Progress towards the right after bypassing the obstacle: close to (16, 14.5).
   - Finally, continue towards the goal position while ensuring not to cross any obstacles.

### New Path Proposal

``` 
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),         # Start in the start set
    (9.0, 5.68),        # Breakpoint from set 1
    (11.5, 10.0),       # Shift upward to avoid Obstacle 3
    (16.0, 14.5),       # Move right past the obstacle
    (18.5, 18.5)        # End in the goal set
]
 ```

This path should avoid obstacles by strategically passing through gaps and ensuring safe navigation while satisfying the waypoint and breakpoint conditions.

[09/09/2024 03:40:30 PM] To resolve the issue where the path intersects with Obstacle 3, we need to make some adjustments and find a safe path around the obstacles.

### Analysis and Adjustments

1. **Starting and Ending:** 
   - The path starts correctly inside the start set and ends inside the goal set.

2. **Obstacle Intersections:**
   - The problematic segment is between (11.5, 10.0) and (16.0, 14.5), intersecting with Obstacle 3. We need to find a way around this obstacle.

3. **Valid Subpath:**
   - The longest valid segment so far is [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 5.68), (11.5, 10.0)]. Let's attempt to continue from (11.5, 10.0), moving around the obstacles.

4. **Planning a New Path:**
   - From (11.5, 10.0), we should attempt to bypass the lower edge of Obstacle 3. One potential waypoint might be around (12.0, 12.0) to navigate beneath the obstacle.
   - Subsequently, move upwards to (17.0, 17.0) to ensure clearance of Obstacle 3.
   - Finally, direct towards the endpoint within the goal set at (19.0, 19.0).

### New Path Proposal

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),         # start in start set
    (9.0, 5.68),        # move towards breakpoint
    (11.5, 10.0),       # navigate towards lower edge
    (12.0, 12.0),       # adjust to avoid Obstacle 3
    (17.0, 17.0),       # move upwards clear of Obstacle 3
    (19.0, 19.0)        # end in goal set
]
```

This path should avoid intersecting with any obstacles while satisfying the start and end requirements. Let me know if there are any further changes you'd like to discuss!

Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/09/2024 03:40:45 PM] To correct the path, we need to adjust the waypoints such that the path doesn’t intersect with any obstacles while still starting in the start set, ending in the goal set, and passing through a breakpoint.

### Analysis

1. **Start and End Points**: 
   - The path correctly starts in the start set at (1.0, 1.0).
   - The path correctly ends at (19.0, 19.0) in the goal set.

2. **Breakpoint**:
   - The path uses the first breakpoint (9.0, 5.68), which is valid.

3. **Obstacle Intersection**:
   - The segment from (12.0, 12.0) to (17.0, 17.0) intersects with Obstacle 3.

### Adjustments

1. **From (12.0, 12.0) to (17.0, 17.0)**:
   - This segment intersects Obstacle 3. We need to reroute this part of the path to avoid the obstacle.
   - Move slightly north-east towards (14.0, 14.5) to steer clear of the obstacle boundary, then continue towards (19.0, 19.0).

2. **New Path**:
   - We'll maintain the valid subpath up to (12.0, 12.0), then adjust to navigate around the obstacle before heading to the goal.

### New Path Proposal

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),       # Start in the start set
    (9.0, 5.68),      # Pass through the breakpoint
    (11.5, 10.0),     # Continue valid path
    (12.0, 12.0),     # Last valid point before intersection
    (14.0, 14.5),     # Adjust to avoid Obstacle 3
    (17.0, 17.5),     # Head towards the goal set while staying clear of obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)      # End in the goal set
]
```

This adjusted path should avoid intersecting with any obstacles while meeting all the specified constraints.
