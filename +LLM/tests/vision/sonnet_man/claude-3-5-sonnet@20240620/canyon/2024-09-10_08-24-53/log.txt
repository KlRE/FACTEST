# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -1.58), (2.0, 1.72)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

[09/10/2024 08:25:13 AM] Based on the provided information and image, I'll propose a path that meets the requirements:

1. The path starts within the blue start set.
2. It avoids the red obstacle areas.
3. It passes through one of the breakpoints in the specified set.
4. It ends within the green goal set.
5. The path uses arbitrary waypoints that aren't always parallel to an axis.

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.2, 0.4),  # Start point within the blue start set
    (1.0, 0.0),  # Move towards the open area
    (2.0, -1.58),  # Pass through the lower breakpoint of Set 1
    (3.0, 0.0),  # Move upwards to avoid the lower obstacle
    (3.5, 1.5),  # Continue moving up and slightly right
    (3.7, 2.5),  # Final approach to goal set
    (3.5, 2.7)   # End point within the green goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the blue quadrilateral.
2. Moves downward and to the right to avoid the upper obstacle.
3. Passes through the breakpoint (2.0, -1.58) from Set 1.
4. Curves upward to avoid the lower obstacle.
5. Approaches the goal set from below.
6. Ends within the green goal quadrilateral.

The path maintains a safe distance from the obstacles while meeting all the specified requirements. It uses arbitrary waypoints that aren't always parallel to an axis, providing a smooth and efficient route through the canyon-like environment depicted in the image.

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.2, 0.4)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

[09/10/2024 08:25:21 AM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids obstacles and meets the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start point (0.2, 0.4) is valid and within the start set.
2. The first segment from (0.2, 0.4) to (1.0, 0.0) intersects with Obstacle 2, so we need to adjust the path.
3. We need to pass through one of the breakpoints: (2.0, -1.58) or (2.0, 1.72).
4. The lower breakpoint (2.0, -1.58) is surrounded by obstacles, making it difficult to reach without intersections.
5. The upper breakpoint (2.0, 1.72) seems more accessible and provides a clearer path to the goal.

Path Adjustment:
1. Start from a point within the start set, slightly higher to avoid Obstacle 2.
2. Move towards the upper breakpoint (2.0, 1.72), staying above Obstacle 2.
3. After passing the breakpoint, curve towards the goal set, avoiding Obstacle 1.
4. Enter the goal set from the bottom-right corner.

New path proposal:

new_path = [
    (0.2, 0.6),    # Start point, moved slightly higher to avoid Obstacle 2
    (1.0, 1.2),    # Intermediate point to curve away from Obstacle 2
    (2.0, 1.72),   # Upper breakpoint
    (3.0, 2.2),    # Intermediate point to curve towards the goal
    (3.8, 2.6),    # Approaching the goal set
    (3.5, 2.7)     # End point within the goal set
]

This new path should:
1. Start within the start set
2. Avoid intersecting with both obstacles
3. Pass through the required breakpoint (2.0, 1.72)
4. End within the goal set

The path now takes a higher route to avoid Obstacle 2 entirely, passes through the upper breakpoint, and then curves gently towards the goal set while maintaining a safe distance from Obstacle 1. This approach should resolve the intersection issue and meet all the specified requirements.
