# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -1.58), (2.0, 1.72)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[09/10/2024 08:18:30 AM] Thank you for providing the detailed information about the motion planning task. I've analyzed the environment based on the given data and the provided image. Here's my proposed path that meets the requirements:

new_path = [
    (0.2, 0.4),  # Start within the start set
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Move towards the gap between obstacles
    (2.0, -1.58),  # Pass through one of the breakpoints from Set 1
    (3.0, 0.5),  # Navigate through the gap between obstacles
    (3.5, 2.5)   # End within the goal set
]

Explanation:
1. The path starts at (0.2, 0.4), which is within the start set (blue quadrilateral).
2. It then moves to (1.0, 1.0) to position itself for passing through the breakpoint.
3. The path goes through the breakpoint (2.0, -1.58) from Breakpoint Set 1.
4. It then moves to (3.0, 0.5) to navigate through the gap between the two obstacles.
5. Finally, it ends at (3.5, 2.5), which is within the goal set (green quadrilateral).

This path avoids all obstacles while meeting the requirements of starting in the start set, ending in the goal set, and passing through one of the specified breakpoints. The waypoints are chosen to keep a safe distance from the obstacles while providing a relatively smooth path.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

[09/10/2024 08:18:39 AM] Thank you for providing the detailed information and feedback. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids obstacles and meets the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct.
2. The issue occurs in the second segment between (1.0, 1.0) and (2.0, -1.58), which intersects with Obstacle 2.
3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 2 while still reaching one of the breakpoints.
4. The breakpoint (2.0, 1.72) seems more promising as it's above Obstacle 2.
5. We should aim to pass through the narrow corridor between the two obstacles.

Path planning:
1. We'll start from (0.2, 0.4) in the start set.
2. We'll keep the second point at (1.0, 1.0) as it's still valid.
3. Instead of going down, we'll go up to avoid Obstacle 2, aiming for the breakpoint at (2.0, 1.72).
4. From there, we'll navigate through the corridor between obstacles.
5. Finally, we'll approach the goal set from above.

New path proposal:

new_path = [
    (0.2, 0.4),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Second point (unchanged)
    (2.0, 1.72),   # Breakpoint, avoiding Obstacle 2
    (3.0, 2.5),    # Navigate through the corridor
    (3.5, 3.0),    # Approach goal set
    (3.5, 2.5)     # End point inside goal set
]

Explanation:
1. The path starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
2. It passes through the required breakpoint (2.0, 1.72).
3. By going upward to (2.0, 1.72), we avoid intersecting Obstacle 2.
4. The segment from (2.0, 1.72) to (3.0, 2.5) passes through the corridor between the obstacles.
5. The final approach to the goal set is from above, staying clear of both obstacles.

This path should avoid all obstacles while meeting the requirements of starting and ending in the correct sets and passing through a breakpoint. The waypoints are chosen to provide a clear path through the environment, maintaining a safe distance from obstacles.
