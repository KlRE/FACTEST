# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -1.58), (2.0, 1.72)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example

[09/10/2024 08:21:18 AM] Based on the provided information and the image, I'll propose a path that meets the requirements:

1. The path starts within the blue start set.
2. It avoids the red obstacle areas.
3. It passes through one of the breakpoints in the given set.
4. It ends within the green goal set.
5. The path uses arbitrary waypoints that aren't always parallel to an axis.

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.2, 0.4),  # Start point within the blue start set
    (1.0, 0.0),  # Move slightly down and right to avoid the lower obstacle
    (2.0, -1.58),  # Pass through the lower breakpoint
    (3.0, 0.5),  # Move up and right to avoid the upper obstacle
    (4.0, 2.5)   # End point within the green goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the blue quadrilateral representing the start set.
2. Moves slightly down and right to avoid the lower red obstacle.
3. Passes through the breakpoint at (2.0, -1.58) as required.
4. Curves upward to avoid the upper red obstacle.
5. Ends within the green quadrilateral representing the goal set.

The path maintains a safe distance from the obstacles and uses non-axis-parallel segments to navigate efficiently through the available space. It satisfies all the given requirements while providing a smooth trajectory from start to goal.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[09/10/2024 08:21:28 AM] Thank you for providing the detailed information and feedback. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles and meets the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start set is approximately a quadrilateral between (0, 0) and (1, 1).
2. The goal set is roughly a quadrilateral around (3, 3) to (4, 4).
3. There are two large obstacles that cover much of the space between the start and goal.
4. The first segment of the previous path intersected with Obstacle 2.
5. We need to pass through one of the breakpoints: (2.0, -1.58) or (2.0, 1.72).
6. There's a narrow passage between the two obstacles that we can utilize.

Path planning:
1. We'll start from a point within the start set, closer to (0, 0) to avoid immediate collision.
2. We'll aim for the breakpoint at (2.0, 1.72), as it seems to be in a safer position.
3. From there, we'll navigate through the narrow passage between the obstacles.
4. Finally, we'll move towards the goal set, ending in a point within it.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.1, 0.2),     # Start within the start set
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Move diagonally to avoid immediate collision
    (2.0, 1.72),    # Reach the breakpoint
    (3.0, 2.5),     # Navigate through the narrow passage
    (3.5, 3.0),     # Continue moving towards the goal
    (3.7, 2.7)      # End within the goal set
]

Explanation:
1. (0.1, 0.2) is safely within the start set and away from Obstacle 2.
2. (1.0, 1.0) helps us move diagonally, avoiding the lower part of Obstacle 2.
3. (2.0, 1.72) is one of the required breakpoints and positions us well for the next move.
4. (3.0, 2.5) takes us through the narrow passage between the obstacles.
5. (3.5, 3.0) continues our path towards the goal set.
6. (3.7, 2.7) ends our path within the goal set.

This path should avoid intersecting with both obstacles while meeting all the requirements. It starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, passes through a breakpoint, and navigates around the obstacles using the available space between them.
