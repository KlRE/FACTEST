# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -1.58), (2.0, 1.72)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

[09/10/2024 08:21:37 AM] Based on the provided information and image, I'll propose a path that meets the requirements:

1. The path starts within the blue start set.
2. It avoids the red obstacle areas.
3. It passes through one of the breakpoints in the given set.
4. It ends within the green goal set.
5. The path maintains a safe distance from obstacles.

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.2, 0.4),  # Start point within the blue start set
    (1.0, 0.0),  # Move slightly right and down
    (2.0, -1.58),  # Pass through the lower breakpoint
    (3.0, -1.0),  # Move up and right, avoiding the lower obstacle
    (3.5, 1.0),   # Continue moving up and slightly right
    (3.5, 2.5),   # Move straight up
    (3.3, 2.7),   # Slight adjustment left and up to enter goal set
    (3.2, 2.9)    # End point within the green goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the blue quadrilateral.
2. Moves downward initially to avoid the lower edge of the top obstacle.
3. Passes through the breakpoint at (2.0, -1.58).
4. Curves upward between the two obstacles, maintaining a safe distance from both.
5. Approaches the goal set from below, avoiding the upper obstacle.
6. Ends within the green goal quadrilateral.

The path avoids intersecting with any obstacles and maintains a safe distance throughout its trajectory. It also satisfies the requirement of passing through one of the given breakpoints.

[09/10/2024 08:21:46 AM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids obstacles and meets the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The first segment of the original path intersects with Obstacle 2, which extends from the bottom left to the top right of the image.
2. We need to find a way around this obstacle while still reaching the breakpoint (2.0, -1.58).
3. There appears to be a narrow passage between the two obstacles that we can utilize.
4. After passing through the breakpoint, we need to navigate carefully to reach the goal set without intersecting the obstacles.

New path proposal:

new_path = [
    (0.2, 0.4),  # Start point (unchanged)
    (0.5, 1.0),  # Move up to avoid Obstacle 2
    (1.5, 1.5),  # Continue moving up and right through the passage
    (2.0, -1.58),  # Reach the required breakpoint
    (2.5, 0.0),  # Move up and right to avoid Obstacle 2
    (3.5, 1.5),  # Continue moving up and right
    (3.7, 2.5),  # Approach the goal set
    (3.4, 2.8)   # End point within the goal set
]

Explanation of changes:
1. Instead of moving directly towards (1.0, 0.0), we now move upwards first to (0.5, 1.0) to avoid intersecting Obstacle 2.
2. We then navigate through the narrow passage between the obstacles by moving to (1.5, 1.5).
3. From there, we can safely reach the required breakpoint at (2.0, -1.58).
4. After the breakpoint, we move up and right to (2.5, 0.0) to avoid intersecting Obstacle 2 again.
5. We continue moving up and right to (3.5, 1.5) and (3.7, 2.5) to approach the goal set from a safe angle.
6. Finally, we end at (3.4, 2.8), which is within the goal set.

This new path should avoid all obstacles while still meeting the requirements of starting in the start set, ending in the goal set, and passing through one of the required breakpoints. The path takes advantage of the narrow passage between the obstacles and carefully navigates around them to reach the goal.

[09/10/2024 08:22:24 AM] Thank you for providing the feedback and the detailed information about the environment. I'll analyze the situation and suggest a new path that avoids obstacles and meets all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The current path intersects with Obstacle 2 between points (1.5, 1.5) and (2.0, -1.58).
2. The longest valid subpath from the start is [(0.2, 0.4), (0.5, 1.0), (1.5, 1.5)].
3. We need to pass through one of the breakpoints: (2.0, -1.58) or (2.0, 1.72).
4. The start and goal sets are separated by two large obstacles, with a narrow passage between them.

Path Adjustment Strategy:
1. Start from the valid subpath endpoint (1.5, 1.5).
2. Move upwards to avoid Obstacle 2 and aim for the breakpoint (2.0, 1.72).
3. Navigate through the narrow passage between the obstacles.
4. Approach the goal set from above to avoid intersecting with Obstacle 1.

New path suggestion:

new_path = [
    (0.2, 0.4),   # Start point (unchanged)
    (0.5, 1.0),   # Second point (unchanged)
    (1.5, 1.5),   # Third point (unchanged)
    (2.0, 1.72),  # Breakpoint, avoiding Obstacle 2
    (2.5, 2.0),   # Moving slightly upward to ensure clearance from obstacles
    (3.0, 2.2),   # Navigating through the narrow passage
    (3.5, 2.5),   # Continuing through the passage
    (3.7, 2.8),   # Approaching the goal set
    (3.4, 3.0)    # End point inside the goal set
]

Explanation:
1. The first three points remain unchanged as they form a valid subpath.
2. We then move to the breakpoint (2.0, 1.72), which helps us avoid Obstacle 2 and satisfies the breakpoint requirement.
3. The path then navigates through the narrow passage between the obstacles, maintaining a safe distance from both.
4. Finally, we approach the goal set from above, ensuring we don't intersect with Obstacle 1.
5. The last point (3.4, 3.0) is chosen to be safely inside the goal set.

This new path should satisfy all the requirements:
- It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
- It avoids all obstacles.
- It passes through one of the required breakpoints.
- It uses arbitrary waypoints that are not always parallel to one axis.

The path may be further optimized for smoothness or efficiency, but this suggestion should meet all the specified criteria while avoiding obstacles.
