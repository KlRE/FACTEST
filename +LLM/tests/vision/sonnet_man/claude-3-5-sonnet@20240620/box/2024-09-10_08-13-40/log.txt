# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 0.56), (5.12, 9.44)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/10/2024 08:13:46 AM] Based on the provided information and image, I'll plan a path that meets the requirements. Let's analyze the environment:

1. The start set is a small blue square in the bottom-left corner.
2. The goal set is a small green square in the top-right corner.
3. There's a large diamond-shaped obstacle in the center.
4. We need to pass through one of the breakpoints: (5.12, 0.56) or (5.12, 9.44).

Here's a suitable path:

new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start within the blue start set
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Move towards the bottom-left to avoid the obstacle
    (5.12, 0.56),  # Pass through the lower breakpoint
    (9.0, 0.56),   # Move right, staying below the obstacle
    (9.0, 9.0),    # Move up along the right edge of the environment
    (9.0, 9.0)     # End within the green goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the blue start set.
2. Avoids the diamond-shaped obstacle by going around its bottom-left corner.
3. Passes through the breakpoint (5.12, 0.56).
4. Stays clear of the obstacle edges.
5. Ends within the green goal set.

The path takes a wide berth around the obstacle to ensure it doesn't cross or touch it at any point. It utilizes the lower breakpoint and takes advantage of the space below and to the right of the obstacle to reach the goal.

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(1.75, 1.75), (0.5, 0.5), (5.12, 0.56), (9.0, 0.56)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

[09/10/2024 08:13:53 AM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids obstacles and meets all the requirements.

Analyzing the environment:
1. The start set is located at the bottom-left corner of the map.
2. The goal set is located at the top-right corner of the map.
3. There's a large diamond-shaped obstacle in the center of the map.
4. We need to pass through one of the breakpoints: (5.12, 0.56) or (5.12, 9.44).

Thought process for the new path:
1. The previous path intersected with the obstacle when trying to move directly from (9.0, 0.56) to (9.0, 9.0).
2. We can use the valid subpath up to (9.0, 0.56) as a starting point.
3. To avoid the obstacle, we need to go around it, either above or below.
4. Given that we're already at a low y-coordinate (0.56), it makes sense to go below the obstacle.
5. We'll add waypoints to curve around the bottom-right corner of the obstacle.
6. After passing the obstacle, we can move upwards towards the goal set.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Move towards the bottom-left corner
    (5.12, 0.56),  # Pass through the required breakpoint
    (9.0, 0.56),   # Move right, staying below the obstacle
    (9.5, 1.0),    # Curve slightly upwards
    (9.5, 5.0),    # Move up, clearing the obstacle
    (9.0, 9.0),    # Move towards the goal set
    (9.0, 9.0)     # End within the goal set
]

This new path should:
1. Start in the correct start set
2. End in the correct goal set
3. Pass through one of the required breakpoints (5.12, 0.56)
4. Avoid intersecting with the obstacle by going around its bottom-right corner
5. Provide a smooth and feasible trajectory from start to goal

The path now takes a longer route to avoid the obstacle, but it should satisfy all the requirements and constraints of the motion planning task.
