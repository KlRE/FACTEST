# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 0.56), (5.12, 9.44)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate

[09/10/2024 08:14:55 AM] Based on the provided information and image, I'll plan a path that meets the requirements. Let's analyze the environment:

1. The start set is a small blue square in the bottom-left corner.
2. The goal set is a small green square in the top-right corner.
3. There's a large diamond-shaped obstacle in the center of the space.
4. We need to pass through one of the breakpoints: (5.12, 0.56) or (5.12, 9.44).

Here's a path that should meet all the requirements:

new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start within the blue start set
    (1.0, 0.75),   # Move towards the bottom edge to avoid the obstacle
    (5.12, 0.56),  # Pass through the lower breakpoint
    (9.0, 5.0),    # Move towards the top-right, staying clear of the obstacle
    (9.0, 9.0),    # Continue upwards
    (9.0, 9.0),    # Small adjustment to ensure we're within the goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set (blue square).
2. Ends within the goal set (green square).
3. Avoids the diamond-shaped obstacle by going around its bottom edge.
4. Passes through one of the required breakpoints (5.12, 0.56).
5. Uses arbitrary waypoints that aren't always parallel to an axis.
6. Maintains a safe distance from the obstacle edges.

The path first moves slightly towards the bottom-left to avoid the obstacle, then proceeds to the lower breakpoint. From there, it moves diagonally up and to the right, staying clear of the obstacle's edge. Finally, it moves straight up to reach the goal set in the top-right corner.

    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[09/10/2024 08:15:04 AM] Thank you for providing the detailed information about the path planning task and the current path evaluation. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The current path starts correctly in the start set and ends in the goal set.
2. The path passes through the required breakpoint (5.12, 0.56).
3. The issue occurs in the segment from (5.12, 0.56) to (9.0, 5.0), which intersects with Obstacle 1.

To correct this, we need to find a way around Obstacle 1 while still reaching the goal set. Let's consider the spatial relationships:

1. Obstacle 1 is a diamond shape in the center of the area.
2. There's space to maneuver below and above the obstacle.
3. We need to maintain a safe distance from the obstacle edges.

Proposed solution:
1. Keep the first three waypoints as they are valid.
2. After the breakpoint (5.12, 0.56), we'll go around the bottom of the obstacle.
3. Then we'll move upwards to reach the goal set.

Here's the new proposed path with explanations:

new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start point (unchanged)
    (1.0, 0.75),   # Move towards the breakpoint (unchanged)
    (5.12, 0.56),  # Breakpoint (unchanged)
    (7.0, 0.75),   # Move right and slightly up to clear the bottom of the obstacle
    (9.0, 2.0),    # Continue moving right and up, staying clear of the obstacle
    (9.5, 5.0),    # Move up along the right side of the area
    (9.0, 9.0)     # Final point in the goal set
]

Explanation of changes:
1. The path now avoids Obstacle 1 by going underneath it.
2. After passing the breakpoint, we move to (7.0, 0.75) to clear the bottom edge of the obstacle.
3. Then we continue to (9.0, 2.0) to fully pass the obstacle while maintaining a safe distance.
4. We then move upwards to (9.5, 5.0) to approach the goal set.
5. Finally, we end at (9.0, 9.0), which is within the goal set.

This new path should satisfy all the requirements:
1. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
2. It passes through the required breakpoint (5.12, 0.56).
3. It avoids intersecting with the obstacle.
4. The waypoints are not always parallel to one axis, allowing for more flexible movement.

This solution provides a smoother path that maintains a safe distance from the obstacle while fulfilling all the given criteria.
