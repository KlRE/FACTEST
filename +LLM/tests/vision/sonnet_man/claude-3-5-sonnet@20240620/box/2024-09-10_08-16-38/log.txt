# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 0.56), (5.12, 9.44)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]

[09/10/2024 08:16:44 AM] Thank you for providing the detailed information about the motion planning task. I've analyzed the environment based on the provided data and image. Here's a proposed path that meets the requirements:

new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start within the start set
    (1.75, 0.5),   # Move down to avoid the obstacle
    (5.12, 0.56),  # Move to the breakpoint from Set 1
    (9.0, 8.5),    # Move towards the goal set, staying clear of the obstacle
    (9.0, 9.0)     # End within the goal set
]

Explanation of the path:

1. The path starts at (1.75, 1.75), which is within the blue start set.
2. It then moves down to (1.75, 0.5) to avoid the large diamond-shaped obstacle.
3. From there, it moves to (5.12, 0.56), which is one of the breakpoints from Set 1.
4. The path then proceeds to (9.0, 8.5), moving towards the goal set while maintaining a safe distance from the obstacle.
5. Finally, it ends at (9.0, 9.0), which is within the green goal set.

This path satisfies all the given requirements:
- It starts within the start set and ends within the goal set.
- It avoids the obstacle by maintaining a safe distance.
- It passes through one of the breakpoints (5.12, 0.56) from Set 1.
- The waypoints are arbitrary and not always parallel to one axis.
- The path does not cross or touch any obstacles.

The path takes a wide berth around the obstacle to ensure safety and follows a relatively simple trajectory while meeting all the specified criteria.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

[09/10/2024 08:17:16 AM] Thank you for providing the detailed information and feedback on the previous path. Let's analyze the situation and create a new path that meets all the requirements.

Analyzing the environment:
1. The start set is in the bottom-left corner, and the goal set is in the top-right corner.
2. There's a large diamond-shaped obstacle in the center of the space.
3. The path needs to pass through one of the breakpoints: (5.12, 0.56) or (5.12, 9.44).
4. The previous path intersected with the obstacle when moving from (5.12, 0.56) to (9.0, 8.5).

Thought process for creating a new path:
1. We'll start from the same point in the start set: (1.75, 1.75).
2. We'll keep the movement to (1.75, 0.5) as it's valid and helps avoid the bottom part of the obstacle.
3. We'll continue to use the breakpoint (5.12, 0.56) as it's already part of the valid subpath.
4. From (5.12, 0.56), we need to find a way around the obstacle to reach the goal set.
5. We can move rightward to avoid the obstacle, then upward, and finally towards the goal set.

New path proposal:

new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start point
    (1.75, 0.5),   # Move down to avoid the bottom of the obstacle
    (5.12, 0.56),  # Breakpoint
    (9.5, 0.56),   # Move right to clear the obstacle
    (9.5, 9.0),    # Move up to the level of the goal set
    (9.0, 9.0)     # Move slightly left to enter the goal set
]

Explanation of the new path:
1. The path starts at (1.75, 1.75), which is within the start set.
2. It moves down to (1.75, 0.5) to avoid the bottom part of the obstacle.
3. It then moves to the breakpoint (5.12, 0.56), satisfying the breakpoint requirement.
4. From there, it moves right to (9.5, 0.56), which clears the rightmost point of the diamond obstacle.
5. Then it moves straight up to (9.5, 9.0), avoiding the top part of the obstacle.
6. Finally, it moves slightly left to (9.0, 9.0), which is within the goal set.

This path should avoid intersecting with the obstacle while meeting all the requirements:
- It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
- It passes through one of the required breakpoints.
- It avoids crossing the obstacle by moving around its right side.
- The waypoints are not always parallel to one axis, providing more flexibility in movement.

This new path should resolve the issues with the previous path and successfully navigate from the start to the goal while avoiding obstacles.
