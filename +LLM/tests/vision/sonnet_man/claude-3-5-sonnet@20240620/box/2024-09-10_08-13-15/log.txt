# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 0.56), (5.12, 9.44)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

[09/10/2024 08:13:21 AM] Based on the provided information and image, I'll create a path that meets the requirements. Let's analyze the environment:

1. The start set is a small blue square in the bottom-left corner.
2. The goal set is a small green square in the top-right corner.
3. There's a large diamond-shaped obstacle in the center of the image.
4. We need to pass through one of the breakpoints at (5.12, 0.56) or (5.12, 9.44).

Here's a path that satisfies the requirements:

new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start within the start set
    (3.0, 0.75),   # Move towards the lower breakpoint while avoiding the obstacle
    (5.12, 0.56),  # Pass through the lower breakpoint
    (7.5, 2.0),    # Move upwards and to the right, avoiding the obstacle
    (8.5, 6.0),    # Continue moving upwards and slightly to the right
    (9.0, 9.0)     # End within the goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set (blue square).
2. Ends within the goal set (green square).
3. Avoids the diamond-shaped obstacle by going underneath it.
4. Passes through the breakpoint at (5.12, 0.56).
5. Uses arbitrary waypoints that are not always parallel to one axis.
6. Maintains a safe distance from the obstacle edges.

The path first moves slightly downward to avoid the lower point of the obstacle, then passes through the required breakpoint. After that, it moves upward and to the right, staying clear of the obstacle's right edge, before finally reaching the goal set in the top-right corner.

[09/10/2024 08:13:31 AM] Thank you for providing the detailed information and feedback. I'll analyze the situation and suggest a new path that avoids obstacles and meets all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct.
2. The path successfully passed through one of the breakpoints (5.12, 0.56).
3. The issue arose with the segment between (7.5, 2.0) and (8.5, 6.0), which intersected with the diamond-shaped obstacle.

To correct this, we need to adjust the path to go around the obstacle while still reaching the goal. Let's consider the spatial relationships:

1. The diamond obstacle covers a large central area of the map.
2. There's a narrow passage between the bottom edge of the obstacle and the lower boundary of the map.
3. The breakpoint (5.12, 0.56) is already in this lower passage, which is beneficial.

New path strategy:
1. Keep the initial segments up to (7.5, 2.0) as they are valid.
2. Instead of going directly towards the goal from (7.5, 2.0), we'll continue in the lower passage.
3. Once we're past the rightmost point of the obstacle, we'll move upwards towards the goal.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start point (unchanged)
    (3.0, 0.75),   # Second point (unchanged)
    (5.12, 0.56),  # Breakpoint (unchanged)
    (7.5, 2.0),    # Last valid point from the previous path
    (8.5, 2.5),    # New point to continue in the lower passage
    (9.0, 5.0),    # New point to start moving upwards
    (9.0, 8.75)    # End point inside the goal set
]

Explanation of the new segments:
- (7.5, 2.0) to (8.5, 2.5): This segment continues through the lower passage, staying below the obstacle.
- (8.5, 2.5) to (9.0, 5.0): This segment moves slightly to the right and then upwards, clearing the rightmost point of the obstacle.
- (9.0, 5.0) to (9.0, 8.75): This final segment moves directly upwards into the goal set.

This new path should avoid intersecting with the obstacle while still meeting all the requirements:
1. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
2. It passes through the required breakpoint (5.12, 0.56).
3. It avoids intersecting with the obstacle by using the lower passage and then moving upwards once clear of the obstacle.

This solution maintains the valid parts of the original path while adjusting the latter half to successfully navigate around the obstacle and reach the goal.

[09/10/2024 08:13:40 AM] Thank you for providing the feedback and the current path information. I'll analyze the situation and suggest a new path that avoids obstacles and meets all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The current path starts correctly in the start set and initially avoids obstacles.
2. The path passes through the required breakpoint (5.12, 0.56), which is good.
3. The issue occurs with the segment between (8.5, 2.5) and (9.0, 5.0), which intersects with Obstacle 1.
4. We need to adjust the path to go around Obstacle 1 while still reaching the goal set.

Path Adjustment Thought Process:
1. We'll keep the valid subpath up to (8.5, 2.5).
2. From there, we need to find a way around Obstacle 1 to reach the goal set.
3. Observing the obstacle shape, we can see that going around the left side of the obstacle would be a longer path. The right side seems more direct.
4. We'll add waypoints to navigate around the right side of Obstacle 1.
5. After passing the obstacle, we'll move towards the goal set.

New Path Suggestion:

new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start point (unchanged)
    (3.0, 0.75),   # Second point (unchanged)
    (5.12, 0.56),  # Breakpoint (unchanged)
    (7.5, 2.0),    # Fourth point (unchanged)
    (8.5, 2.5),    # Fifth point (unchanged)
    (9.25, 3.5),   # New point to start moving around the right side of Obstacle 1
    (9.25, 6.5),   # New point to continue moving up, clearing the obstacle
    (9.0, 8.75)    # Final point in the goal set (unchanged)
]

Explanation of Changes:
1. We kept the first five points of the original path as they were valid.
2. Added a new point (9.25, 3.5) to move to the right of Obstacle 1. The x-coordinate of 9.25 ensures we're clear of the obstacle's right edge.
3. Added another point (9.25, 6.5) to continue moving upward, safely passing the top-right corner of Obstacle 1.
4. Kept the final point (9.0, 8.75) as it's already within the goal set.

This new path should avoid intersecting with Obstacle 1 while still meeting all the requirements:
- It starts in the start set
- It passes through the required breakpoint (5.12, 0.56)
- It avoids obstacles
- It ends in the goal set

The path now takes a slight detour to the right of Obstacle 1, ensuring a clear path to the goal without intersections.
