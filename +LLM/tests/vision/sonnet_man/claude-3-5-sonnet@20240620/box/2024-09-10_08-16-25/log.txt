# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 0.56), (5.12, 9.44)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/10/2024 08:16:30 AM] Based on the provided image and information, I'll create a path that meets the requirements. Let's analyze the environment:

1. The start set is a small blue square in the bottom-left corner.
2. The goal set is a small green square in the top-right corner.
3. There's a large diamond-shaped obstacle in the center of the image.
4. We need to pass through one of the breakpoints (5.12, 0.56) or (5.12, 9.44).

Let's plan a path that avoids the obstacle and meets all requirements:

new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start within the start set
    (1.75, 0.56),  # Move down to align with the lower breakpoint
    (5.12, 0.56),  # Move right to pass through the lower breakpoint
    (8.25, 0.56),  # Continue right to clear the obstacle
    (8.25, 9.0),   # Move up to align with the goal set
    (9.0, 9.0)     # Move right to end within the goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set
2. Ends within the goal set
3. Passes through the breakpoint (5.12, 0.56)
4. Avoids the obstacle by going below it
5. Uses arbitrary waypoints that aren't always parallel to one axis
6. Maintains a safe distance from the obstacle

The path first moves down from the start set to align with the lower breakpoint, then moves right to pass through it. It continues right to clear the obstacle, then moves up and finally right again to reach the goal set. This route ensures that all linear segments between waypoints avoid crossing the obstacle.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[09/10/2024 08:16:38 AM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Chain of Thought:
1. The current path intersects with Obstacle 1 between points (8.25, 0.56) and (8.25, 9.0).
2. We need to modify the path to go around the diamond-shaped obstacle.
3. The breakpoint (5.12, 0.56) is already included in the valid subpath, so we'll keep that.
4. To avoid the obstacle, we can go around its left side, as it appears to have more space.
5. We'll add waypoints to navigate around the obstacle's left side.
6. After passing the obstacle, we'll move towards the goal set.
7. We'll ensure the path ends within the goal set coordinates.

Based on this analysis, here's a proposed new path:

new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start point (unchanged)
    (1.75, 0.56),  # Move down (unchanged)
    (5.12, 0.56),  # Breakpoint (unchanged)
    (0.75, 0.56),  # Move left to avoid obstacle
    (0.75, 5.0),   # Move up along the left side of the obstacle
    (0.75, 9.44),  # Continue moving up past the obstacle
    (8.75, 9.44),  # Move right towards the goal set
    (9.0, 9.0)     # End point within the goal set
]

This new path should avoid intersecting with the obstacle while still meeting all the requirements:
1. It starts in the start set.
2. It ends in the goal set.
3. It passes through the required breakpoint (5.12, 0.56).
4. It avoids intersecting with the obstacle by going around its left side.
5. The path segments don't cross any obstacles.

The path now takes a longer route, but it ensures obstacle avoidance and meets all the specified criteria. If this path is still not satisfactory or if there are any other constraints to consider, please let me know, and I'll be happy to make further adjustments.
