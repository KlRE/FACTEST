# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]

[09/10/2024 08:55:25 AM] Thank you for providing the detailed information about the motion planning task. I'll analyze the environment and propose a path that meets the given requirements.

Based on the image and the provided data:

1. The start set is a blue square in the bottom-left corner, approximately at (0,0) to (1,1).
2. The goal set is a green square in the top-right corner, approximately at (4,4) to (5,5).
3. There are two red obstacles:
   - A rectangular obstacle at the bottom-right corner.
   - A large diagonal obstacle stretching from the top-left to the middle-right of the space.
4. There's a breakpoint set with two points: (2.0, -2.5) and (2.0, 5.5).

Considering these factors, here's a proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (2.0, 5.5),    # Move to the upper breakpoint, avoiding the diagonal obstacle
    (3.5, 5.5),    # Move right, staying above the diagonal obstacle
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Move down and slightly right into the goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set
2. Passes through one of the breakpoints (2.0, 5.5)
3. Avoids both obstacles by moving above them
4. Ends within the goal set
5. Uses arbitrary waypoints that are not always parallel to one axis

The path first moves upward to avoid the large diagonal obstacle, then uses the upper breakpoint to navigate around it. It then moves right, staying above the diagonal obstacle, before finally moving down into the goal set. This route should provide ample clearance from both obstacles while meeting all the specified requirements.

[09/10/2024 08:55:33 AM] Thank you for providing the detailed information about the path planning task and the feedback on the previous attempt. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start point (0.5, 0.5) is valid and within the start set.
2. The first segment from (0.5, 0.5) to (2.0, 5.5) intersects with Obstacle 2, which is a large diagonal obstacle.
3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 2 while still reaching one of the breakpoints.
4. The breakpoint (2.0, 5.5) is above Obstacle 2, so we'll aim for that.
5. The goal set is located at the top-right corner of the map.

New path planning:
1. Start from (0.5, 0.5) in the start set.
2. Move right to avoid the lower part of Obstacle 2.
3. Then move up along the right side of Obstacle 2.
4. Reach the breakpoint (2.0, 5.5) by moving slightly left.
5. From there, move towards the goal set.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point
    (3.5, 0.5),    # Move right to avoid the lower part of Obstacle 2
    (3.5, 5.5),    # Move up along the right side of Obstacle 2
    (2.0, 5.5),    # Reach the breakpoint
    (4.5, 4.5)     # End in the goal set
]

Explanation of the new path:
1. (0.5, 0.5) to (3.5, 0.5): This segment moves right, staying below Obstacle 2.
2. (3.5, 0.5) to (3.5, 5.5): This vertical segment moves up along the right edge of Obstacle 2, maintaining a safe distance.
3. (3.5, 5.5) to (2.0, 5.5): This short segment moves left to reach the required breakpoint.
4. (2.0, 5.5) to (4.5, 4.5): The final segment moves diagonally down and right to reach the goal set.

This path should avoid all obstacles while meeting the requirements of starting in the start set, ending in the goal set, and passing through one of the breakpoints. The path maintains a safe distance from obstacles and uses arbitrary waypoints that are not always parallel to one axis.

[09/10/2024 08:55:41 AM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids obstacles and meets the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start point (0.5, 0.5) is valid and within the start set.
2. The first segment from (0.5, 0.5) to (3.5, 0.5) intersects with Obstacle 2, which is a large diagonal obstacle.
3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 2 while still passing through one of the breakpoints: (2.0, -2.5) or (2.0, 5.5).
4. The breakpoint (2.0, 5.5) seems more promising as it's closer to the goal and above the diagonal obstacle.
5. We should aim to go around the top of Obstacle 2 to reach the breakpoint (2.0, 5.5).
6. From there, we can move towards the goal set while avoiding Obstacle 2.

New path proposal:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point within the start set
    (0.5, 6.0),    # Move upward to clear the top of Obstacle 2
    (2.0, 5.5),    # Move to the breakpoint
    (3.5, 5.5),    # Move right to clear Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)     # End point within the goal set
]

Explanation:
1. We start at (0.5, 0.5) within the start set.
2. Instead of moving directly towards the goal, we first move upward to (0.5, 6.0). This point is chosen to be above the highest point of Obstacle 2 (which reaches up to y=6.0).
3. From there, we move to the breakpoint (2.0, 5.5), satisfying the requirement to pass through one of the breakpoints.
4. Next, we move right to (3.5, 5.5) to ensure we're clear of Obstacle 2's diagonal edge.
5. Finally, we move to (4.5, 4.5), which is within the goal set.

This path should avoid all obstacles while meeting the requirements of starting in the start set, ending in the goal set, and passing through a breakpoint. The segments are chosen to maintain a safe distance from the obstacles, especially the large diagonal Obstacle 2.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 6.0), (2.0, 5.5), (3.5, 5.5), (4.5, 4.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 1 between points (0.5, 0.5) and (0.5, 6.0) intersects with obstacle(s):

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.5, 0.5)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

[09/10/2024 08:55:49 AM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and suggest a new path that avoids obstacles and meets the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start point (0.5, 0.5) is valid and within the start set.
2. The first segment from (0.5, 0.5) to (0.5, 6.0) intersects with Obstacle 2, which is a large diagonal obstacle.
3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 2 while still reaching one of the breakpoints.
4. The breakpoint at (2.0, 5.5) is above Obstacle 2, so we'll aim for that.
5. The goal set is located at the top-right corner of the map, so we'll need to navigate around Obstacle 2 to reach it.

New path planning:
1. Start from (0.5, 0.5) in the start set.
2. Move right to avoid the lower part of Obstacle 2.
3. Then move up to reach the breakpoint at (2.0, 5.5).
4. From there, move right and slightly down to avoid the upper part of Obstacle 2.
5. Finally, approach the goal set from the left.

Here's the new suggested path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point
    (3.5, 0.5),    # Move right to avoid lower part of Obstacle 2
    (3.5, 5.5),    # Move up
    (2.0, 5.5),    # Reach the breakpoint
    (3.5, 5.0),    # Move right and slightly down to avoid upper part of Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)     # End point in the goal set
]

This path should satisfy all the requirements:
1. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
2. It avoids all obstacles by maintaining a safe distance.
3. It passes through the breakpoint (2.0, 5.5).
4. The path doesn't cross any obstacles.
5. The waypoints are not always parallel to one axis, allowing for more flexible movement.

This path takes a wider route around Obstacle 2, ensuring that it doesn't intersect with any part of the obstacle while still reaching the required breakpoint and ending in the goal set.

[09/10/2024 08:55:58 AM] Thank you for providing the detailed information about the motion planning task and the feedback on the previous path. Let's analyze the situation and create a new path that meets all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start set is a unit square from (0,0) to (1,1).
2. The goal set is a square from (4,4) to (5,5).
3. There are two obstacles:
   - Obstacle 1 is a rectangle at the bottom right.
   - Obstacle 2 is a large diagonal obstacle cutting across much of the space.
4. There's a breakpoint set with two points: (2.0, -2.5) and (2.0, 5.5).
5. The previous path intersected with Obstacle 2 in its first segment.

Path Planning:
1. We'll start from the start set, choosing a point near (0.5, 0.5).
2. To avoid Obstacle 2, we need to move upwards first before moving right.
3. We'll aim for the breakpoint at (2.0, 5.5), which is above Obstacle 2.
4. From there, we can move towards the goal set while staying above Obstacle 2.
5. Finally, we'll enter the goal set from above.

New path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point within the start set
    (0.5, 5.5),    # Move straight up to avoid Obstacle 2
    (2.0, 5.5),    # Move right to the breakpoint
    (3.5, 5.5),    # Continue moving right, staying above Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Move diagonally down-right into the goal set
]

Explanation:
- The path starts at (0.5, 0.5), which is within the start set.
- It then moves straight up to (0.5, 5.5) to avoid intersecting with Obstacle 2.
- The path then moves right to (2.0, 5.5), which is one of the given breakpoints.
- It continues moving right to (3.5, 5.5), staying above Obstacle 2.
- Finally, it moves diagonally down-right to (4.5, 4.5), which is within the goal set.

This path should avoid all obstacles, start and end in the correct sets, and pass through one of the required breakpoints. The segments are not always parallel to the axes, allowing for more flexible movement. The path maintains a safe distance from the obstacles to avoid any potential intersections.

[09/10/2024 08:56:08 AM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids obstacles and meets the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The current path intersects with Obstacle 2, which is a large diagonal obstacle blocking a direct path to the goal.
2. We need to find a way around this obstacle while still passing through one of the breakpoints.
3. The breakpoint (2.0, 5.5) seems more promising as it's above the diagonal obstacle.
4. We should aim to go around the top of Obstacle 2 to reach the goal.

New path proposal:

1. Start from (0.5, 0.5) in the start set.
2. Move upward to (0.5, 6.0) to clear the top of Obstacle 2.
3. Move right to the breakpoint (2.0, 5.5).
4. Continue right to (3.5, 5.5) to clear the right edge of Obstacle 2.
5. Move down and slightly right to (4.0, 5.0) to approach the goal set.
6. End at (4.5, 4.5) inside the goal set.

This path should avoid all obstacles while meeting the requirements of passing through a breakpoint and starting/ending in the correct sets.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (0.5, 6.0),
    (2.0, 5.5),
    (3.5, 5.5),
    (4.0, 5.0),
    (4.5, 4.5)
]

This path takes a wider berth around Obstacle 2, using the vertical space above it to safely navigate to the goal. It also incorporates the required breakpoint (2.0, 5.5) and maintains a safe distance from all obstacles throughout its trajectory.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]

[09/10/2024 08:56:17 AM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The initial path segment from (0.5, 0.5) to (0.5, 6.0) intersects with Obstacle 2, which is a large diagonal obstacle.
2. We need to find a way around this obstacle while still passing through one of the breakpoints: (2.0, -2.5) or (2.0, 5.5).
3. The breakpoint (2.0, -2.5) is below Obstacle 1, so it might be challenging to reach the goal from there.
4. The breakpoint (2.0, 5.5) is above Obstacle 2, which seems more promising for reaching the goal.
5. We need to navigate around the left side of Obstacle 2 to reach the breakpoint (2.0, 5.5).
6. From there, we can move towards the goal while avoiding the upper-right corner of Obstacle 2.

Based on this analysis, I propose the following new path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start in the start set
    (-1.0, 3.0),   # Move left and up to avoid Obstacle 2
    (0.0, 5.0),    # Continue moving up
    (2.0, 5.5),    # Reach the breakpoint
    (3.5, 5.75),   # Move right and slightly up to avoid the corner of Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)     # End in the goal set
]

Explanation of the new path:
1. We start at (0.5, 0.5) within the start set.
2. To avoid Obstacle 2, we first move left and up to (-1.0, 3.0), which is outside the obstacle's boundary.
3. We then continue moving upward to (0.0, 5.0), staying clear of Obstacle 2's left side.
4. From there, we move to the breakpoint (2.0, 5.5), satisfying the breakpoint requirement.
5. To avoid the upper-right corner of Obstacle 2, we move right and slightly up to (3.5, 5.75).
6. Finally, we move diagonally down and right to (4.5, 4.5), ending within the goal set.

This path should avoid all obstacles while meeting all the requirements: it starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, passes through one of the breakpoints, and avoids intersecting with any obstacles. The segments between waypoints are chosen to maintain a safe distance from the obstacles' edges.

[09/10/2024 08:56:24 AM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and suggest a new path that avoids obstacles and meets the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The first segment of the original path intersects with Obstacle 2, which is a large diagonal obstacle.
2. We need to find a way around this obstacle while still reaching one of the breakpoints.
3. The breakpoint at (2.0, 5.5) seems more accessible and closer to the goal, so we'll aim for that.
4. We need to move around the left side of Obstacle 2 to reach the breakpoint.
5. After reaching the breakpoint, we can move towards the goal set.

New path reasoning:
1. Start from (0.5, 0.5) in the start set.
2. Move left and up to avoid Obstacle 2, aiming for a point around (-2.5, 4.5).
3. From there, move right and slightly up to reach the breakpoint at (2.0, 5.5).
4. After the breakpoint, move right and slightly down to enter the goal set.

Here's the suggested new path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),     # Start in the start set
    (-2.5, 4.5),    # Move left and up to avoid Obstacle 2
    (2.0, 5.5),     # Reach the breakpoint
    (4.5, 4.5)      # End in the goal set
]

This path should:
1. Start in the correct start set
2. Avoid intersecting with any obstacles
3. Pass through one of the required breakpoints (2.0, 5.5)
4. End in the correct goal set

The path now takes a wider curve around the left side of Obstacle 2, ensuring it doesn't intersect with any part of the obstacle. By reaching the breakpoint at (2.0, 5.5), we fulfill that requirement while also positioning ourselves well to reach the goal set. The final segment from the breakpoint to the goal set should not intersect with any obstacles.

[09/10/2024 08:56:30 AM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids obstacles and meets the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start point (0.5, 0.5) is valid and within the start set.
2. The second segment from (-2.5, 4.5) to (2.0, 5.5) intersects with Obstacle 2, which is the large diagonal obstacle.
3. We need to avoid this obstacle while still trying to reach one of the breakpoints: (2.0, -2.5) or (2.0, 5.5).
4. The breakpoint (2.0, 5.5) seems more achievable as it's closer to the goal set.
5. We should try to go around Obstacle 2 on its left side, as that provides a clearer path to the goal.

New path proposal:

1. Start at (0.5, 0.5) within the start set.
2. Move to (-2.0, 3.0) to avoid the lower part of Obstacle 2.
3. Then move to (-2.5, 5.5) to clear the top of Obstacle 2.
4. Now we can safely move to the breakpoint (2.0, 5.5).
5. Finally, move to (4.5, 4.5) to end within the goal set.

This path avoids all obstacles, passes through one of the required breakpoints, starts in the start set, and ends in the goal set.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (-2.0, 3.0),
    (-2.5, 5.5),
    (2.0, 5.5),
    (4.5, 4.5)
]

This path should successfully navigate around the obstacles while meeting all the requirements. It takes a wider berth around Obstacle 2 to ensure it doesn't intersect or come too close to the obstacle edges.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.5, 0.5), (-2.0, 3.0), (-2.5, 5.5), (2.0, 5.5), (4.5, 4.5)]

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.5, 0.5), (-2.0, 3.0), (-2.5, 5.5)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

[09/10/2024 08:56:38 AM] Thank you for providing the detailed information and feedback. I'll analyze the situation and suggest a new path that avoids obstacles and meets all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the previous path were correct.
2. The issue arose with the segment between (-2.5, 5.5) and (2.0, 5.5), which intersects with Obstacle 2.
3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 2 while still reaching one of the breakpoints.
4. The breakpoint (2.0, 5.5) seems to be inside or very close to Obstacle 2, making it difficult to use.
5. The other breakpoint (2.0, -2.5) is below all obstacles and might provide a better option.

New path strategy:
1. Start from the start set.
2. Move towards the lower breakpoint (2.0, -2.5) while avoiding Obstacle 2.
3. From the lower breakpoint, move upwards and to the right to reach the goal set.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),      # Start in the start set
    (-1.0, -1.0),    # Move down and left to avoid Obstacle 2
    (2.0, -2.5),     # Reach the lower breakpoint
    (3.5, 0.0),      # Move up and right, staying clear of Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 2.0),      # Continue moving up and right
    (4.5, 4.5)       # End in the goal set
]

Explanation:
1. We start at (0.5, 0.5) within the start set.
2. To avoid Obstacle 2, we first move down and left to (-1.0, -1.0).
3. From there, we can safely reach the lower breakpoint at (2.0, -2.5).
4. After the breakpoint, we move up and right to (3.5, 0.0), staying clear of Obstacle 2.
5. We continue moving up and right to (4.5, 2.0), maintaining a safe distance from obstacles.
6. Finally, we move straight up to (4.5, 4.5), ending within the goal set.

This path should avoid all obstacles, pass through one of the required breakpoints, and meet all other specified requirements. It takes a more circuitous route than the previous attempt, but it ensures obstacle avoidance while still reaching the goal.

[09/10/2024 08:56:47 AM] Thank you for providing the detailed information and feedback. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids obstacles and meets the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The current path intersects with Obstacle 2 between points (2.0, -2.5) and (3.5, 0.0).
2. The longest valid subpath is [(0.5, 0.5), (-1.0, -1.0), (2.0, -2.5)].
3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 2 to reach the goal set.
4. The breakpoint (2.0, -2.5) is already included in the valid subpath, so we don't need to worry about including it again.

Proposed solution:
1. Start from the last valid point (2.0, -2.5).
2. Move to the right to avoid Obstacle 2's left edge.
3. Then move upwards to clear the top of Obstacle 2.
4. Finally, approach the goal set from the right side.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),      # Start point (unchanged)
    (-1.0, -1.0),    # Second point (unchanged)
    (2.0, -2.5),     # Breakpoint (unchanged)
    (3.5, -2.5),     # Move right to avoid Obstacle 2's left edge
    (3.5, 2.0),      # Move up to clear Obstacle 2's top edge
    (4.5, 2.0),      # Move right towards the goal set
    (4.5, 4.5)       # End point inside the goal set
]

Explanation:
1. The first three points remain unchanged as they form the valid subpath.
2. We introduce a new point (3.5, -2.5) to move right and avoid Obstacle 2's left edge.
3. Then we move up to (3.5, 2.0) to clear Obstacle 2's top edge. This point is chosen to be safely above the obstacle while not intersecting with any part of it.
4. We then move right to (4.5, 2.0) to approach the goal set.
5. Finally, we move up to (4.5, 4.5) to end inside the goal set.

This path should avoid all obstacles while still starting in the start set, ending in the goal set, and passing through the required breakpoint. The segments between waypoints should not intersect with any obstacles, and we've maintained a safe distance from the obstacles to avoid touching them.

[09/10/2024 08:56:55 AM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The current path intersects with Obstacle 2 between points (3.5, -2.5) and (3.5, 2.0).
2. The longest valid subpath is [(0.5, 0.5), (-1.0, -1.0), (2.0, -2.5), (3.5, -2.5)].
3. We need to adjust the path to avoid Obstacle 2 while still reaching the goal set.
4. The breakpoint (2.0, -2.5) is already included in the valid subpath, so we don't need to worry about including it again.

New path proposal:
1. We'll start from the last valid point (3.5, -2.5).
2. To avoid Obstacle 2, we'll move to the right, then upwards, and finally towards the goal set.
3. We'll add more waypoints to ensure a smoother path around the obstacle.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),      # Start point (unchanged)
    (-1.0, -1.0),    # Second point (unchanged)
    (2.0, -2.5),     # Breakpoint (unchanged)
    (3.5, -2.5),     # Last valid point from previous path
    (5.5, -2.5),     # Move right to clear Obstacle 2
    (5.5, 2.0),      # Move up, staying clear of Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 3.0),      # Move towards the goal set
    (4.5, 4.5)       # End point in the goal set
]

Explanation of changes:
1. We kept the first four points of the original path, as they were valid and included the required breakpoint.
2. From (3.5, -2.5), we moved right to (5.5, -2.5) to clear Obstacle 2 on its right side.
3. Then we moved upwards to (5.5, 2.0), staying clear of Obstacle 2's right edge.
4. To approach the goal set, we added an intermediate point (4.5, 3.0) to ensure a smoother path.
5. Finally, we end at (4.5, 4.5), which is within the goal set.

This new path should avoid all obstacles while still meeting all the requirements, including starting in the start set, ending in the goal set, and passing through the required breakpoint.

[09/10/2024 08:57:17 AM] Thank you for providing the detailed information and feedback. I'll analyze the situation and suggest a new path that avoids obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The current path intersects with Obstacle 1 between points (5.5, -2.5) and (5.5, 2.0).
2. We need to adjust the path to avoid this intersection while still passing through one of the breakpoints.
3. The breakpoint (2.0, -2.5) is already included in the valid subpath, so we can continue from there.
4. Obstacle 2 is a large diagonal obstacle that we need to navigate around.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Start from the valid subpath up to (2.0, -2.5).
2. Instead of moving directly towards the goal, we'll navigate around Obstacle 2.
3. We'll move to the right of Obstacle 2, then upwards, and finally approach the goal from the right side.
4. This approach allows us to avoid both obstacles while still reaching the goal.

Here's the suggested new path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),      # Start point within the start set
    (-1.0, -1.0),    # Move towards the breakpoint
    (2.0, -2.5),     # Reach the breakpoint
    (5.5, -2.5),     # Move right to clear Obstacle 2
    (5.5, 3.0),      # Move upwards, staying to the right of Obstacle 2
    (5.0, 3.5),      # Start moving towards the goal
    (4.5, 4.5)       # End point within the goal set
]

This new path should satisfy all the requirements:
1. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
2. It passes through the breakpoint (2.0, -2.5).
3. It avoids intersecting with both obstacles by navigating around them.
4. The path is represented as an array of waypoints that can be linearly connected.

The path now takes a wider route around the obstacles, ensuring it doesn't intersect with either of them. By moving to the right side of Obstacle 2 before going upwards, we create a safe passage to the goal area without risking any intersections.

[09/10/2024 08:57:26 AM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and suggest a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The current path intersects with Obstacle 1 between points (5.5, -2.5) and (5.5, 3.0).
2. We need to adjust the path to go around Obstacle 1 while still passing through the breakpoint (2.0, -2.5).
3. Obstacle 2 creates a diagonal barrier that we need to navigate around.
4. We should aim to use the valid subpath as much as possible.

Path Adjustment Thought Process:
1. We'll keep the first three waypoints of the valid subpath: (0.5, 0.5), (-1.0, -1.0), (2.0, -2.5).
2. From (2.0, -2.5), we need to move around Obstacle 1. We can do this by going further left before moving up.
3. After clearing Obstacle 1, we'll navigate around Obstacle 2 by moving upwards and then to the right.
4. Finally, we'll approach the goal set from the left side.

New path suggestion:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start in the start set
    (-1.0, -1.0),  # Move towards the breakpoint
    (2.0, -2.5),   # Reach the required breakpoint
    (3.5, -2.5),   # Move right, staying below Obstacle 1
    (3.5, -2.0),   # Move up slightly
    (3.5, 1.0),    # Move up, clearing Obstacle 1
    (3.5, 3.5),    # Continue moving up
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Enter the goal set
]

This new path should:
1. Start in the correct start set
2. Pass through the required breakpoint (2.0, -2.5)
3. Avoid intersecting with Obstacle 1 by going around its bottom-right corner
4. Navigate around Obstacle 2 by staying to its right
5. End in the correct goal set

The path now takes a more circuitous route to avoid the obstacles while still meeting all the requirements. It maintains a safe distance from the obstacles to ensure no intersections occur.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.5, 0.5), (-1.0, -1.0), (2.0, -2.5), (3.5, -2.5), (3.5, -2.0), (3.5, 1.0), (3.5, 3.5), (4.5, 4.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 5 between points (3.5, -2.0) and (3.5, 1.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 2: [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.5, 0.5), (-1.0, -1.0), (2.0, -2.5), (3.5, -2.5), (3.5, -2.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

[09/10/2024 08:57:35 AM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and suggest a new path that avoids obstacles and meets the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The current path intersects with Obstacle 2 between points (3.5, -2.0) and (3.5, 1.0).
2. The longest valid subpath from the start is [(0.5, 0.5), (-1.0, -1.0), (2.0, -2.5), (3.5, -2.5), (3.5, -2.0)].
3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 2 to reach the goal set.
4. The breakpoint (2.0, -2.5) is already included in the valid subpath, so we don't need to worry about including it again.

New path planning:
1. We'll start from the last valid point (3.5, -2.0).
2. To avoid Obstacle 2, we'll move left and then up, keeping a safe distance from the obstacle.
3. Once we're above Obstacle 2, we can move towards the goal set.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),      # Start point (unchanged)
    (-1.0, -1.0),    # Second point (unchanged)
    (2.0, -2.5),     # Breakpoint (unchanged)
    (3.5, -2.5),     # Fourth point (unchanged)
    (3.5, -2.0),     # Last valid point before intersection
    (1.0, -2.0),     # Move left to avoid Obstacle 2
    (1.0, 2.0),      # Move up, staying clear of Obstacle 2
    (3.0, 3.5),      # Move diagonally towards the goal set
    (4.5, 4.5)       # End point in the goal set
]

Explanation of changes:
1. We kept the valid subpath up to (3.5, -2.0).
2. From there, we moved left to (1.0, -2.0) to create a safe distance from Obstacle 2.
3. Then we moved straight up to (1.0, 2.0), which should clear the top of Obstacle 2.
4. From there, we moved diagonally to (3.0, 3.5) to approach the goal set while staying clear of Obstacle 2.
5. Finally, we moved to (4.5, 4.5) to end within the goal set.

This new path should avoid intersecting with any obstacles while still starting in the start set, ending in the goal set, and passing through the required breakpoint. The path takes a wider berth around Obstacle 2 to ensure it doesn't intersect or come too close to the obstacle's edges.

[09/10/2024 08:57:46 AM] Thank you for providing the detailed information and feedback. I'll analyze the situation and suggest a new path that avoids obstacles and meets all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct.
2. The path successfully passed through one of the breakpoints (2.0, -2.5).
3. The main issue was the segment between (1.0, -2.0) and (1.0, 2.0), which intersected with Obstacle 2.

Let's adjust the path to avoid this intersection while maintaining the other correct aspects:

1. We'll keep the initial part of the path up to (1.0, -2.0), as it's valid.
2. From there, we need to find a way around Obstacle 2 to reach the goal.
3. We'll aim to pass above Obstacle 2, as there seems to be more space in that direction.
4. We'll add waypoints to curve around the obstacle safely.
5. Finally, we'll approach the goal set from above.

Here's the new proposed path with explanations:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (-1.0, -1.0),  # Move towards the breakpoint
    (2.0, -2.5),   # Reach the breakpoint
    (3.5, -2.5),   # Continue the valid subpath
    (3.5, -2.0),   # Move up slightly
    (1.0, -2.0),   # Last point of the valid subpath
    (1.0, 0.0),    # Move up, staying to the left of Obstacle 2
    (0.0, 2.0),    # Continue moving up and slightly left to avoid Obstacle 2
    (1.0, 4.0),    # Move right and up, passing above Obstacle 2
    (3.0, 5.0),    # Continue moving right and up
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Enter the goal set
]

Explanation of changes:
1. We kept the initial part of the path up to (1.0, -2.0) as it was valid.
2. Instead of moving directly up from (1.0, -2.0) to (1.0, 2.0), we added intermediate points to navigate around Obstacle 2.
3. We first move up to (1.0, 0.0), then slightly left and up to (0.0, 2.0) to give Obstacle 2 a wide berth.
4. From there, we move right and up to (1.0, 4.0) and (3.0, 5.0), passing above Obstacle 2.
5. Finally, we approach the goal set from above, ending at (4.5, 4.5).

This new path should avoid all obstacles while still starting in the start set, ending in the goal set, and passing through the required breakpoint. The additional waypoints allow for a smoother curve around Obstacle 2, maintaining a safe distance from its edges.

    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]]

    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 7 between points (1.0, 0.0) and (0.0, 2.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 2: [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.5, 0.5), (-1.0, -1.0), (2.0, -2.5), (3.5, -2.5), (3.5, -2.0), (1.0, -2.0), (1.0, 0.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

[09/10/2024 08:57:54 AM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and suggest a new path that avoids obstacles and meets the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The current path intersects with Obstacle 2 between points (1.0, 0.0) and (0.0, 2.0).
2. The longest valid subpath from the start is [(0.5, 0.5), (-1.0, -1.0), (2.0, -2.5), (3.5, -2.5), (3.5, -2.0), (1.0, -2.0), (1.0, 0.0)].
3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 2 to reach the goal set.
4. The path needs to include one of the breakpoints: (2.0, -2.5) or (2.0, 5.5).

New path planning:
1. We'll start from (0.5, 0.5) in the start set.
2. We'll keep the initial part of the path that goes through the breakpoint (2.0, -2.5).
3. Instead of moving upwards through Obstacle 2, we'll go around it to the right.
4. We'll then move upwards to reach the goal set.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start in the start set
    (-1.0, -1.0),  # Move to avoid Obstacle 2
    (2.0, -2.5),   # Reach the required breakpoint
    (3.5, -2.5),   # Continue moving right
    (5.5, -1.0),   # Move up and right to clear Obstacle 2
    (5.5, 3.0),    # Move upwards
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Enter the goal set
]

Explanation:
1. The path starts at (0.5, 0.5) within the start set.
2. It moves to (-1.0, -1.0) to avoid Obstacle 2.
3. The path reaches the required breakpoint (2.0, -2.5).
4. It continues moving right to (3.5, -2.5) and (5.5, -1.0) to go around Obstacle 2.
5. The path then moves upwards to (5.5, 3.0) to clear all obstacles.
6. Finally, it enters the goal set at (4.5, 4.5).

This path should avoid all obstacles, include the required breakpoint, start in the start set, and end in the goal set. The segments between waypoints should not intersect with any obstacles.

[09/10/2024 08:58:01 AM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and suggest a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Chain of Thought:
1. The valid subpath ends at (3.5, -2.5), so we'll continue from there.
2. The main issue is that the path intersects with Obstacle 1 when trying to move upwards.
3. We need to go around Obstacle 1 to reach the goal set.
4. We should also ensure we pass through one of the breakpoints: (2.0, -2.5) or (2.0, 5.5).
5. The path already includes (2.0, -2.5), so we've satisfied the breakpoint requirement.

Path Adjustments:
1. From (3.5, -2.5), we'll move to the right to clear Obstacle 1.
2. Then we'll move upwards, staying to the right of Obstacle 1.
3. We'll then move left towards the goal set, staying above Obstacle 2.
4. Finally, we'll enter the goal set from above.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),      # Start in the start set
    (-1.0, -1.0),    # Move to avoid Obstacle 2
    (2.0, -2.5),     # Pass through the breakpoint
    (3.5, -2.5),     # Last valid point from the previous path
    (6.5, -2.5),     # Move right to clear Obstacle 1
    (6.5, 3.0),      # Move up, staying to the right of Obstacle 1
    (5.5, 3.0),      # Move left, staying above Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)       # Enter the goal set
]

This new path should avoid all obstacles while satisfying the start and goal set requirements, as well as passing through one of the given breakpoints. The path takes a wider route around Obstacle 1 to ensure it doesn't intersect with any obstacles.
