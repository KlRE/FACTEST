# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]]

    Breakpoints:

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]

    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]

[09/10/2024 09:14:13 AM] Based on the provided information and image, I'll suggest a path that meets the requirements:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (2.0, -2.5),   # Move to the lower breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1
    (3.5, -1.5),   # Navigate around the lower-right corner of Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 2.0),    # Move upwards between Obstacles 1 and 2
    (4.5, 4.5)     # End within the goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the blue start set at (0.5, 0.5).
2. Passes through one of the breakpoints (2.0, -2.5) from Breakpoint Set 1.
3. Avoids Obstacle 2 by moving around its lower-right corner.
4. Navigates between Obstacles 1 and 2, maintaining a safe distance from both.
5. Ends within the green goal set at (4.5, 4.5).

The path uses arbitrary waypoints that are not always parallel to one axis, providing a smooth trajectory that avoids obstacles while meeting all the specified requirements.

[09/10/2024 09:14:22 AM] Thank you for providing the feedback and the current path information. I'll analyze the situation and suggest a new path that avoids obstacles and meets all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start point (0.5, 0.5) is valid and within the start set.
2. The path correctly passes through the breakpoint (2.0, -2.5) from Breakpoint Set 1.
3. The issue occurs between points (3.5, -1.5) and (4.5, 2.0), where the path intersects with Obstacle 2.
4. The goal point (4.5, 4.5) is valid and within the goal set.

To correct the path, we need to modify it to avoid Obstacle 2 while still reaching the goal. Here's my thought process for creating a new path:

1. We'll keep the first three points of the valid subpath: (0.5, 0.5), (2.0, -2.5), and (3.5, -1.5).
2. From (3.5, -1.5), we need to navigate around Obstacle 2. Looking at the obstacle's shape, it appears to be a large quadrilateral that extends from the bottom-left to the top-right of the map.
3. To avoid this obstacle, we can move further to the right before going up. This will take us around the right side of the obstacle.
4. After clearing the obstacle, we can then move towards the goal set.

Based on this analysis, here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point
    (2.0, -2.5),   # Breakpoint
    (3.5, -1.5),   # Last valid point from previous path
    (5.5, -1.0),   # Move right to avoid Obstacle 2
    (5.5, 3.0),    # Move up, clearing Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Goal point
]

This new path should:
1. Start in the correct start set
2. Pass through the required breakpoint (2.0, -2.5)
3. Avoid intersecting with Obstacle 2 by going around its right side
4. End in the correct goal set

The path now takes a wider route to the right, which should allow it to clear Obstacle 2 entirely before moving up towards the goal. This approach maintains the valid portions of the original path while addressing the intersection issue with Obstacle 2.

[09/10/2024 09:14:30 AM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The current path intersects with Obstacle 1 between points (3.5, -1.5) and (5.5, -1.0).
2. We need to adjust the path to avoid this obstacle while still passing through one of the breakpoints.
3. The breakpoint (2.0, -2.5) is already included in our valid subpath, so we can continue from there.
4. We need to find a way around Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2 to reach the goal set.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Start from (0.5, 0.5) in the start set.
2. Keep the valid subpath up to (2.0, -2.5), which is one of the breakpoints.
3. Instead of moving northeast towards the obstacle, we'll move southeast to avoid Obstacle 1.
4. Then, we'll curve around Obstacle 1 by moving eastward and then northward.
5. Finally, we'll approach the goal set from the east, avoiding Obstacle 2.

Here's the proposed new path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),     # Start in the start set
    (2.0, -2.5),    # Breakpoint
    (3.5, -3.0),    # Move southeast to avoid Obstacle 1
    (6.5, -3.0),    # Move east, staying below Obstacle 1
    (6.5, 2.0),     # Move north, to the right of Obstacle 1
    (6.5, 4.5),     # Continue north, avoiding Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)      # Enter the goal set
]

This new path should:
1. Start in the correct start set
2. End in the correct goal set
3. Pass through one of the required breakpoints (2.0, -2.5)
4. Avoid intersecting with both obstacles
5. Maintain a safe distance from the obstacles

The path now takes a longer route around the obstacles, but it should satisfy all the requirements and avoid any intersections with the obstacles.
