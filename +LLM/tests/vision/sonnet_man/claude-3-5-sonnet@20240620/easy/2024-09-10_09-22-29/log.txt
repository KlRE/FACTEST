# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 1.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

    ]
    
## Example

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

[09/10/2024 09:22:37 AM] Based on the provided information and image, I'll plan a path that meets the requirements. Here's my analysis and proposed path:

1. The start set is a unit square in the bottom-left corner (blue).
2. The goal set is a 1x1 square in the top-right corner (green).
3. There are two obstacles (red):
   - A horizontal rectangle in the middle
   - A smaller rectangle near the bottom-right

4. There's a breakpoint set with three points, and we need to pass through one of them.

Analyzing the environment:
- There's a clear path between the obstacles.
- We can use the breakpoint at (2.0, 5.5) to help guide our path.

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (2.0, 1.5),    # Move up and right, staying clear of the lower obstacle
    (2.0, 5.5),    # Move up to the chosen breakpoint, clearing the large obstacle
    (4.5, 5.5),    # Move right towards the goal set
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Move down into the goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set
2. Ends within the goal set
3. Avoids all obstacles with a safe margin
4. Passes through one of the required breakpoints (2.0, 5.5)
5. Uses arbitrary waypoints that aren't always parallel to an axis
6. Doesn't cross any obstacles

The path takes a route that goes above both obstacles, using the upper breakpoint to guide it safely between the large obstacle and the top of the environment before entering the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[09/10/2024 09:22:45 AM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and suggest a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start point (0.5, 0.5) is valid and within the start set.
2. The path to (2.0, 1.5) is valid and doesn't intersect any obstacles.
3. The segment from (2.0, 1.5) to (2.0, 5.5) intersects with Obstacle 2, which spans from y=2 to y=4 at x=2.
4. We need to find a way around Obstacle 2 while still utilizing one of the breakpoints.

Thought process for the new path:
1. We'll start from (0.5, 0.5) as it's a valid starting point.
2. We'll keep (2.0, 1.5) as the second point since it's a valid breakpoint and doesn't intersect any obstacles.
3. To avoid Obstacle 2, we'll move horizontally to the right, past the obstacle's right edge at x=3.
4. Then we'll move upwards to clear the top of Obstacle 2.
5. We'll then move left to reach the breakpoint at (2.0, 5.5).
6. Finally, we'll move to the goal set.

Based on this analysis, here's the suggested new path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (2.0, 1.5),
    (3.5, 1.5),
    (3.5, 4.5),
    (2.0, 5.5),
    (4.5, 4.5)
]

Explanation of the new path:
1. (0.5, 0.5) to (2.0, 1.5): This segment remains unchanged as it's valid.
2. (2.0, 1.5) to (3.5, 1.5): We move horizontally to the right, clearing Obstacle 2.
3. (3.5, 1.5) to (3.5, 4.5): We move upwards, staying clear of both obstacles.
4. (3.5, 4.5) to (2.0, 5.5): We move diagonally to reach the breakpoint, avoiding Obstacle 2.
5. (2.0, 5.5) to (4.5, 4.5): We move diagonally to the goal set.

This path should satisfy all the requirements:
- It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
- It avoids all obstacles.
- It passes through two of the given breakpoints (2.0, 1.5) and (2.0, 5.5).
- The path doesn't cross or touch any obstacles.
