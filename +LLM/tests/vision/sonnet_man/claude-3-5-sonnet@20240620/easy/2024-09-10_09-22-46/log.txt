# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 1.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]

[09/10/2024 09:23:06 AM] Based on the provided information and image, I'll plan a path that meets the requirements. Here's my analysis and proposed path:

1. The start set is a small square in the bottom-left corner (blue).
2. The goal set is a small square in the top-right corner (green).
3. There are two obstacles (red rectangles): one horizontal rectangle in the middle and one vertical rectangle near the bottom-right.
4. We need to pass through one of the breakpoints at x=2.0.

Here's a suitable path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),     # Start within the start set
    (2.0, 1.5),     # Move to the breakpoint at (2.0, 1.5), avoiding the lower obstacle
    (1.5, 5.0),     # Move upwards to clear the horizontal obstacle
    (4.5, 5.0),     # Move right towards the goal
    (4.5, 4.5)      # End within the goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set
2. Passes through the required breakpoint at (2.0, 1.5)
3. Avoids both obstacles by going around them
4. Ends within the goal set
5. Uses arbitrary waypoints that aren't always parallel to an axis
6. Maintains a safe distance from obstacles

The path first moves right and slightly up to reach the breakpoint, then goes up to avoid the horizontal obstacle, moves right towards the goal area, and finally slightly down to enter the goal set. This route efficiently navigates the space while meeting all the specified requirements.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

[09/10/2024 09:23:14 AM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The current path intersects with Obstacle 2 between points (2.0, 1.5) and (1.5, 5.0).
2. The longest valid subpath is [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, 1.5), (2.0, 1.5)].
3. We need to pass through one of the breakpoints in the set [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 1.5), (2.0, 5.5)].
4. The breakpoint (2.0, 1.5) is already in our valid subpath, so we can continue from there.

Path Adjustment:
1. We'll keep the first two waypoints of the valid subpath.
2. From (2.0, 1.5), we need to find a way around Obstacle 2.
3. We can move to the right of Obstacle 2 by going to (3.5, 1.5).
4. Then, we can move upwards to (3.5, 4.5) to clear the top of Obstacle 2.
5. Finally, we can move left to enter the goal set at (4.5, 4.5).

New path proposal:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start in the start set
    (2.0, 1.5),  # Pass through the required breakpoint
    (3.5, 1.5),  # Move right to avoid Obstacle 2
    (3.5, 4.5),  # Move up to clear Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)   # Enter the goal set
]

This new path should satisfy all the requirements:
1. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
2. It passes through the breakpoint (2.0, 1.5).
3. It avoids all obstacles by maintaining a safe distance.
4. The path segments do not intersect with any obstacles.

The path now takes a wider route around Obstacle 2, ensuring that it doesn't intersect with any obstacles while still reaching the goal set efficiently.
