# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 1.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[09/10/2024 09:22:22 AM] Based on the provided information and image, I'll plan a path that meets the requirements. Let's analyze the environment:

1. The start set is a small blue square in the bottom-left corner.
2. The goal set is a small green square in the top-right corner.
3. There are two red rectangular obstacles:
   - One horizontal obstacle in the middle
   - One vertical obstacle on the right side
4. There's a set of breakpoints at x=2.0 with different y-coordinates.

Now, let's plan a path:

1. We'll start from the start set, moving upwards.
2. We'll pass through the breakpoint at (2.0, 1.5), which is below the horizontal obstacle.
3. Then we'll move further up, staying to the left of the vertical obstacle.
4. Finally, we'll move right to reach the goal set.

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (2.0, 1.5),    # Pass through the required breakpoint
    (2.0, 4.5),    # Move up, avoiding the horizontal obstacle
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Move right to end within the goal set
]

This path:
- Starts within the start set
- Ends within the goal set
- Passes through one of the required breakpoints (2.0, 1.5)
- Avoids all obstacles with a safe margin
- Uses arbitrary waypoints that aren't always parallel to one axis

The path first moves diagonally to reach the breakpoint, then straight up to clear the horizontal obstacle, and finally moves right to reach the goal, maintaining a safe distance from all obstacles throughout.

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, 1.5)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

[09/10/2024 09:22:29 AM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids obstacles and meets the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The current path intersects with Obstacle 2 between points (2.0, 1.5) and (2.0, 4.5).
2. The longest valid subpath is [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, 1.5)].
3. We need to use one of the breakpoints from the set [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 1.5), (2.0, 5.5)].
4. The breakpoint (2.0, 1.5) is already used and valid.
5. There's a gap between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2 that we can utilize.

New path proposal:
1. We'll start from (0.5, 0.5) in the start set.
2. We'll keep the valid segment to (2.0, 1.5), which uses one of the required breakpoints.
3. To avoid Obstacle 2, we'll move right to (4.5, 1.5), staying below the obstacle.
4. Then we'll move up to (4.5, 4.5) to reach the goal set.

This path avoids all obstacles while using one of the required breakpoints and reaching the goal set.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (2.0, 1.5),
    (4.5, 1.5),
    (4.5, 4.5)
]

This path should satisfy all the requirements:
1. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
2. It uses one of the required breakpoints (2.0, 1.5).
3. It avoids all obstacles by maintaining a safe distance.
4. The path segments do not intersect with any obstacles.

The path takes advantage of the space below Obstacle 2 and to the right of Obstacle 1, creating a clear route to the goal set without any intersections.
