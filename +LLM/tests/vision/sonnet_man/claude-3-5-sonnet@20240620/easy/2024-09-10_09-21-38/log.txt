# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 1.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[09/10/2024 09:21:43 AM] Based on the provided information and the image, I'll plan a path that meets all the requirements. Let's analyze the environment:

1. The start set is a 1x1 square in the bottom-left corner.
2. The goal set is a 1x1 square in the top-right corner.
3. There are two obstacles: a horizontal rectangle in the middle and a smaller rectangle near the bottom-right.
4. We need to pass through one of the breakpoints at x=2.0.

Here's a suitable path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (2.0, 1.5),    # Move to the breakpoint at (2.0, 1.5), avoiding the lower obstacle
    (1.5, 4.5),    # Move upwards to clear the horizontal obstacle
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Move right to the goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set
2. Ends within the goal set
3. Passes through the breakpoint (2.0, 1.5)
4. Avoids all obstacles with a safe margin
5. Uses arbitrary waypoints that aren't always parallel to an axis

The path first moves right and slightly up to reach the breakpoint at (2.0, 1.5). Then it moves upward to clear the large horizontal obstacle. Finally, it moves right to reach the goal set. This route maintains a safe distance from all obstacles and satisfies all the given requirements.

[09/10/2024 09:21:54 AM] Thank you for providing the detailed information and feedback. I'll analyze the situation and suggest a new path that avoids obstacles and meets all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the previous path were correct.
2. The path correctly used one of the breakpoints (2.0, 1.5) from Breakpoint Set 1.
3. The main issue was the segment between (2.0, 1.5) and (1.5, 4.5), which intersected with Obstacle 2.

To correct this, we need to find a way around Obstacle 2 while still using one of the breakpoints. Let's consider the spatial relationships:

1. Obstacle 2 extends from x=-2 to x=3, and y=2 to y=4.
2. There's a gap between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 1 that we can use.
3. We can still use the breakpoint (2.0, 1.5) as it's a valid point.

New path suggestion:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point within the start set
    (2.0, 1.5),    # Using the breakpoint as before
    (1.5, 1.5),    # Move slightly left to avoid Obstacle 1
    (1.5, 4.5),    # Move up, passing to the left of Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Move right to the goal set
]

Explanation of changes:
1. We keep the first two waypoints as they were valid.
2. After reaching (2.0, 1.5), we move slightly left to (1.5, 1.5) to ensure we're clear of Obstacle 1.
3. From there, we move straight up to (1.5, 4.5). This path goes to the left of Obstacle 2, avoiding intersection.
4. Finally, we move right to (4.5, 4.5) to reach the goal set.

This new path should satisfy all requirements:
- It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
- It uses one of the provided breakpoints (2.0, 1.5).
- It avoids all obstacles by maintaining a safe distance.
- The path segments do not intersect with any obstacles.

This solution takes advantage of the space to the left of Obstacle 2 and above Obstacle 1, creating a safe passage to the goal set while still utilizing the required breakpoint.

[09/10/2024 09:22:17 AM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids obstacles and meets all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start point (0.5, 0.5) is valid and within the start set.
2. The path correctly passes through the breakpoint (2.0, 1.5) from Breakpoint Set 1.
3. The issue occurs with the segment from (1.5, 1.5) to (1.5, 4.5), which intersects with Obstacle 2.
4. We need to find a way around Obstacle 2 while still reaching the goal set.

New path proposal:
1. We'll start from the last valid point (1.5, 1.5).
2. To avoid Obstacle 2, we'll move right to clear its right edge at x=3.0.
3. Then we'll move up to clear the top edge of Obstacle 2 at y=4.0.
4. Finally, we'll move towards the goal set.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (2.0, 1.5),    # Breakpoint (unchanged)
    (1.5, 1.5),    # Last valid point (unchanged)
    (3.5, 1.5),    # Move right to clear Obstacle 2
    (3.5, 4.5),    # Move up to clear Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)     # End point in goal set
]

Explanation:
1. The path starts at (0.5, 0.5) within the start set.
2. It passes through the breakpoint (2.0, 1.5) as required.
3. From (1.5, 1.5), we move right to (3.5, 1.5), which avoids Obstacle 2 by giving it a 0.5 unit clearance on its right side.
4. We then move up to (3.5, 4.5), which clears the top of Obstacle 2 by 0.5 units.
5. Finally, we move to (4.5, 4.5), which is within the goal set.

This path should avoid all obstacles while meeting all the requirements:
- It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
- It passes through one of the required breakpoints.
- All segments avoid intersecting with obstacles.
- The path is represented as an array of waypoints that can be linearly connected.
