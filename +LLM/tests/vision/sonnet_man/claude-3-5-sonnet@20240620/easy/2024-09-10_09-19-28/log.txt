# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 1.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[09/10/2024 09:19:33 AM] After analyzing the provided image and data, I can propose a path that meets the requirements. The path will start within the blue start set, pass through one of the specified breakpoints, avoid the red obstacles, and end within the green goal set.

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point within the start set
    (2.0, 1.5),    # Breakpoint from Set 1
    (1.5, 4.5),    # Waypoint to avoid Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)     # End point within the goal set
]

Explanation of the path:
1. The path starts at (0.5, 0.5), which is within the blue start set.
2. It then moves to (2.0, 1.5), which is one of the breakpoints from Set 1.
3. To avoid Obstacle 2, the path goes up to (1.5, 4.5), passing to the left of the obstacle.
4. Finally, it moves right to (4.5, 4.5), which is within the green goal set.

This path successfully avoids both obstacles while meeting all the specified requirements. It starts in the start set, passes through a required breakpoint, and ends in the goal set. The linear segments between these waypoints do not intersect with any obstacles.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[09/10/2024 09:19:41 AM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and suggest a new path that addresses the issues.

Analyzing the environment:
1. The start set is a unit square from (0,0) to (1,1).
2. The goal set is a 1x1 square from (4,4) to (5,5).
3. There are two obstacles:
   - Obstacle 1 is a rectangle from (2,0) to (4,1)
   - Obstacle 2 is a large rectangle from (-2,2) to (3,4)
4. There's a breakpoint set with points at (2,-2.5), (2,1.5), and (2,5.5)

The previous path intersected with Obstacle 2 when moving from (2.0, 1.5) to (1.5, 4.5). To correct this, we need to find a way around Obstacle 2.

New path analysis:
1. We'll start from the same point (0.5, 0.5) within the start set.
2. We'll use the breakpoint (2.0, 1.5) as it's a valid point that doesn't intersect with any obstacles.
3. To avoid Obstacle 2, we need to go around it. The safest route appears to be going below it, as there's more space between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2.
4. After passing below Obstacle 2, we can move upwards to reach the goal set.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point
    (2.0, 1.5),    # Breakpoint, just above Obstacle 1
    (3.5, 1.5),    # Move right to clear Obstacle 1
    (3.5, 3.5),    # Move up, staying to the right of Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)     # End point within the goal set
]

This path should avoid all obstacles while still using one of the provided breakpoints. It starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and maintains a safe distance from all obstacles. The path goes around Obstacle 2 by first moving to the right of Obstacle 1, then moving upwards when it's clear of both obstacles.
