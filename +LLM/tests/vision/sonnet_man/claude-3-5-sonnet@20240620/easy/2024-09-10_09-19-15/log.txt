# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 1.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[09/10/2024 09:19:21 AM] HTTP Request: POST https://europe-west1-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/gentle-keyword-432706-b3/locations/europe-west1/publishers/anthropic/models/claude-3-5-sonnet@20240620:rawPredict "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[09/10/2024 09:19:21 AM] Based on the provided information and the image, I'll plan a path that meets the requirements:

1. The path starts in the blue start set (bottom left).
2. It avoids the red obstacle areas.
3. It passes through one of the breakpoints (2.0, 1.5).
4. It ends in the green goal set (top right).

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (2.0, 1.5),    # Pass through the breakpoint
    (1.5, 4.5),    # Move up to avoid the large obstacle
    (4.5, 4.5)     # End within the goal set
]

Explanation:
1. The path begins at (0.5, 0.5), which is within the start set.
2. It then moves to (2.0, 1.5), which is one of the provided breakpoints.
3. To avoid the large obstacle, the path then goes up to (1.5, 4.5), staying clear of both obstacles.
4. Finally, it moves right to (4.5, 4.5), ending within the goal set.

This path satisfies all the requirements:
- It starts and ends in the correct sets
- It avoids all obstacles with a safe margin
- It passes through one of the required breakpoints
- The linear segments connecting these waypoints do not intersect any obstacles

The path takes a simple approach of moving up and then right to reach the goal, which is effective for this relatively straightforward environment.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[09/10/2024 09:19:28 AM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and suggest a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start point (0.5, 0.5) is valid and inside the start set.
2. The path correctly passes through the breakpoint (2.0, 1.5).
3. The segment from (2.0, 1.5) to (1.5, 4.5) intersects with Obstacle 2, which we need to avoid.
4. We need to find a way around Obstacle 2 while still reaching the goal set.

Path Adjustment Thought Process:
1. We can keep the first two waypoints: (0.5, 0.5) and (2.0, 1.5).
2. From (2.0, 1.5), we need to move around Obstacle 2. We can go to the right of it.
3. A point to the right of Obstacle 2 could be (3.5, 1.5). This avoids both Obstacle 1 and 2.
4. From there, we can move upwards to a point above Obstacle 2, such as (3.5, 4.5).
5. Finally, we can move to the goal set at (4.5, 4.5).

This new path avoids all obstacles, starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and passes through one of the required breakpoints (2.0, 1.5).

New suggested path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (2.0, 1.5),
    (3.5, 1.5),
    (3.5, 4.5),
    (4.5, 4.5)
]

This path should satisfy all the requirements:
1. It starts in the start set at (0.5, 0.5).
2. It passes through the breakpoint (2.0, 1.5).
3. It avoids all obstacles by going around them.
4. It ends in the goal set at (4.5, 4.5).
5. All segments are straight lines that don't intersect with any obstacles.

This path takes a slightly longer route but ensures obstacle avoidance while meeting all the specified criteria.
