# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.0, 1.0], [8.0, 1.0], [8.0, -0.0], [9.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.0, -4.0), (4.0, 3.0)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

[09/10/2024 11:13:22 AM] Based on the provided information and image, I'll describe a path that meets the requirements:

The environment shows a start area (blue rectangle) on the left, a goal area (green rectangle) on the right, and an angled obstacle (orange parallelogram) in the center. There's also a set of breakpoints to consider.

Here's a proposed path that avoids the obstacle, starts in the blue area, ends in the green area, and passes through one of the breakpoints:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point within the blue start area
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Move diagonally up and right to avoid the obstacle
    (4.0, 3.0),    # Pass through the upper breakpoint
    (6.0, 2.0),    # Move towards the goal area
    (8.5, 0.5)     # End point within the green goal area
]

This path:
1. Starts within the blue start area
2. Moves diagonally upward to avoid the angled obstacle
3. Passes through the upper breakpoint at (4.0, 3.0)
4. Continues moving towards the goal area while maintaining a safe distance from the obstacle
5. Ends within the green goal area

The path maintains a safe distance from the obstacle throughout its course, ensuring it doesn't cross or touch the obstacle at any point. It also satisfies the requirement of passing through one of the provided breakpoints.

[09/10/2024 11:13:31 AM] Thank you for providing the detailed information and feedback on the previous path. Let's analyze the situation and create a new path that meets all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the previous path were correct.
2. The path successfully passed through one of the breakpoints (4.0, 3.0).
3. The issue arose with the segment between (4.0, 3.0) and (6.0, 2.0), which intersected with Obstacle 1.

Let's adjust the path to avoid the obstacle while maintaining the other requirements:

1. We'll keep the first three waypoints as they are valid: [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, 2.0), (4.0, 3.0)].
2. From (4.0, 3.0), we need to find a way around the obstacle to reach the goal.
3. The obstacle is angled, so we'll need to move further up before moving towards the goal.
4. We'll add a point above the obstacle, then move towards the goal.

New path proposal:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start point in the start set
    (2.0, 2.0),  # Intermediate point
    (4.0, 3.0),  # Breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1
    (5.0, 4.5),  # Point above the obstacle
    (7.0, 3.0),  # Moving towards the goal
    (8.5, 0.5)   # End point in the goal set
]

Explanation of changes:
1. We kept the first three points as they were valid.
2. After reaching (4.0, 3.0), we added a new point (5.0, 4.5) to move above the obstacle.
3. Then we added (7.0, 3.0) to start moving towards the goal while staying clear of the obstacle.
4. Finally, we kept the last point (8.5, 0.5) as it was already correctly placed in the goal set.

This new path should:
1. Start in the start set
2. End in the goal set
3. Pass through one of the breakpoints (4.0, 3.0)
4. Avoid intersecting with the obstacle

The path now takes a higher route to avoid the obstacle, which should resolve the intersection issue while maintaining all other requirements.

[09/10/2024 11:13:41 AM] Thank you for providing the detailed information about the path planning task and the feedback on the previous attempt. I'll analyze the situation and suggest a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the previous path were correct.
2. The path successfully passed through one of the required breakpoints (4.0, 3.0).
3. The issue occurred in the segment between (5.0, 4.5) and (7.0, 3.0), which intersected with Obstacle 1.

To correct this, we need to adjust the path to avoid the obstacle while still reaching the goal. Let's consider the spatial relationships:

1. Obstacle 1 is a large quadrilateral that extends from the bottom-left to the top-right of the space.
2. There's a narrow passage between the top of Obstacle 1 and the upper boundary of the space.
3. The breakpoint (4.0, 3.0) is still valid and can be used.

New path planning:
1. We'll keep the initial part of the path up to the breakpoint (4.0, 3.0).
2. From there, we'll move upward to pass above Obstacle 1.
3. Then, we'll move towards the goal while staying above the obstacle.
4. Finally, we'll descend to reach the goal area.

Here's the new suggested path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Intermediate point (unchanged)
    (4.0, 3.0),    # Breakpoint (unchanged)
    (4.0, 5.0),    # Move upward to clear the top of Obstacle 1
    (7.0, 5.0),    # Move right while staying above Obstacle 1
    (8.5, 0.5)     # Descend to the goal area
]

Explanation of changes:
1. The first three points remain the same, as they were valid and included the required breakpoint.
2. After (4.0, 3.0), instead of moving diagonally towards (5.0, 4.5), we now move straight up to (4.0, 5.0). This ensures we clear the top of Obstacle 1.
3. We then move horizontally to (7.0, 5.0), staying above Obstacle 1 the entire time.
4. Finally, we descend diagonally to (8.5, 0.5) in the goal area.

This new path should avoid intersecting with Obstacle 1 while still meeting all the requirements:
- It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
- It passes through the required breakpoint (4.0, 3.0).
- It avoids intersecting with the obstacle by passing above it.
- The waypoints are not always parallel to one axis, allowing for more flexibility in path planning.

This solution provides a safe passage around the obstacle while maintaining the other constraints of the problem.
