# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.0, 1.0], [8.0, 1.0], [8.0, -0.0], [9.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.0, -4.0), (4.0, 3.0)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

[09/10/2024 11:12:38 AM] After analyzing the image and the provided data, I can propose a path that meets the given requirements. Here's my analysis and proposed path:

1. The start set is a small blue square in the bottom-left corner.
2. The goal set is a small green square in the top-right corner.
3. There's a large diagonal obstacle (red) in the center of the image.
4. We need to pass through one of the breakpoints: (4.0, -4.0) or (4.0, 3.0).

Given these constraints, I propose the following path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the blue start set
    (2.0, -2.0),   # Move diagonally down to avoid the obstacle
    (4.0, -4.0),   # Reach the first breakpoint
    (7.5, 1.5),    # Move diagonally up, staying clear of the obstacle
    (8.5, 0.5)     # End within the green goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set
2. Ends within the goal set
3. Avoids the obstacle by going underneath it
4. Passes through the breakpoint (4.0, -4.0)
5. Uses arbitrary waypoints that aren't always parallel to one axis
6. Maintains a safe distance from the obstacle

The path first moves diagonally down to avoid the obstacle, then reaches the breakpoint at (4.0, -4.0). From there, it moves diagonally up and to the right, staying clear of the obstacle, before finally reaching the goal set.

[09/10/2024 11:12:46 AM] Thank you for providing the detailed information and feedback. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids obstacles and meets all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct.
2. The issue arose with the segment between (2.0, -2.0) and (4.0, -4.0), which intersects with Obstacle 1.
3. We need to use one of the breakpoints: (4.0, -4.0) or (4.0, 3.0).
4. The obstacle is a diagonal shape, so we need to plan a path that goes around it.

Path planning:
1. We'll start from the valid subpath: [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, -2.0)].
2. Instead of going directly to (4.0, -4.0), we'll go upwards to avoid the obstacle.
3. We'll use the breakpoint (4.0, 3.0) as it allows us to go around the obstacle.
4. After passing the obstacle, we can move towards the goal set.

New path proposal:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point in the start set
    (2.0, -2.0),   # Valid point from the original path
    (3.0, 1.0),    # Move upwards to avoid the obstacle
    (4.0, 3.0),    # Breakpoint, safely above the obstacle
    (6.0, 2.0),    # Move towards the goal, staying above the obstacle
    (8.5, 0.5)     # End point in the goal set
]

Explanation:
1. We keep the first two points from the original valid subpath.
2. We then move upwards to (3.0, 1.0) to start avoiding the obstacle.
3. We use the breakpoint (4.0, 3.0), which is safely above the obstacle.
4. After passing the obstacle, we move towards the goal set with point (6.0, 2.0).
5. Finally, we end at (8.5, 0.5), which is within the goal set.

This path should avoid intersecting with the obstacle while meeting all the requirements, including using a breakpoint and staying within the start and goal sets.

[09/10/2024 11:12:55 AM] Analyzing the provided path and feedback, I can see that the path intersects with Obstacle 1 between the points (4.0, 3.0) and (6.0, 2.0). Let's adjust the path to avoid this intersection while still maintaining the requirement to pass through one of the breakpoints.

The valid subpath up to the intersection point is [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, -2.0), (3.0, 1.0), (4.0, 3.0)]. We'll use this as a starting point for our new path.

Looking at the environment:
1. The obstacle is angled, creating a narrow passage on its left side.
2. We need to pass through one of the breakpoints, and we've already used (4.0, 3.0).
3. The goal is to the right of the obstacle.

Here's my thought process for adjusting the path:

1. Keep the initial part of the path up to (4.0, 3.0) as it's valid.
2. From (4.0, 3.0), we need to move around the left side of the obstacle.
3. We can add a point slightly to the left and above the obstacle's top-left corner to ensure we don't touch it.
4. Then, we can move towards the right, staying above the obstacle.
5. Finally, we can descend towards the goal area.

Based on this analysis, here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start point (unchanged)
    (2.0, -2.0),  # Second point (unchanged)
    (3.0, 1.0),   # Third point (unchanged)
    (4.0, 3.0),   # Breakpoint (unchanged)
    (1.5, 4.5),   # New point to move left and up, avoiding the obstacle
    (7.5, 4.5),   # New point to move right, staying above the obstacle
    (8.5, 0.5)    # End point in the goal area
]

This new path should:
1. Start in the correct start set
2. Pass through the required breakpoint (4.0, 3.0)
3. Avoid intersecting with the obstacle by going around its left side and above it
4. End in the correct goal set

The path takes a wider berth around the obstacle to ensure it doesn't come close to intersecting. The additional points (1.5, 4.5) and (7.5, 4.5) create a safe passage above the obstacle, allowing the path to then descend safely to the goal area.
