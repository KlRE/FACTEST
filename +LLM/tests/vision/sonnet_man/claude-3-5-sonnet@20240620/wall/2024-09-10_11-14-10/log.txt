# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.0, 1.0], [8.0, 1.0], [8.0, -0.0], [9.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.0, -4.0), (4.0, 3.0)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]

[09/10/2024 11:14:16 AM] Thank you for providing the detailed information about the motion planning task. I've analyzed the environment based on the given data and the provided image. Here's my proposed path that meets the requirements:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),     # Start point within the start set
    (2.0, 2.0),     # Move diagonally to avoid the obstacle
    (4.0, 3.0),     # Pass through the breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1
    (7.5, 1.5),     # Move towards the goal while staying clear of the obstacle
    (8.5, 0.5)      # End point within the goal set
]

Explanation of the path:

1. The path starts at (0.5, 0.5), which is within the blue start set.
2. It then moves diagonally to (2.0, 2.0) to begin avoiding the obstacle.
3. The path passes through (4.0, 3.0), which is one of the breakpoints from Breakpoint Set 1.
4. It then moves to (7.5, 1.5) to approach the goal while maintaining a safe distance from the obstacle.
5. Finally, it ends at (8.5, 0.5), which is within the green goal set.

This path satisfies all the given requirements:
- It starts within the start set and ends within the goal set.
- It avoids the obstacle by maintaining a safe distance.
- It passes through one of the required breakpoints (4.0, 3.0).
- The waypoints are arbitrary and not always parallel to one axis, allowing for diagonal movements.
- The linear segments connecting these waypoints do not cross the obstacle.

This path provides a smooth and efficient route from the start to the goal while meeting all the specified constraints.

[09/10/2024 11:14:25 AM] Thank you for providing the detailed information about the motion planning task and the current path evaluation. I'll analyze the situation and suggest a new path that avoids obstacles and meets the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the current path are correct, being within the start and goal sets respectively.
2. The path correctly passes through one of the breakpoints (4.0, 3.0) from Breakpoint Set 1.
3. The issue lies in the segment between (4.0, 3.0) and (7.5, 1.5), which intersects with Obstacle 1.

To correct this, we need to adjust the path to avoid the obstacle while still maintaining the other requirements. Let's think through a new approach:

1. We'll keep the starting point (0.5, 0.5) and the second point (2.0, 2.0) as they are valid.
2. We'll also keep the breakpoint (4.0, 3.0) as it's crucial for meeting the breakpoint requirement.
3. To avoid the obstacle, we need to go around it. Given its shape, it seems safer to go above it rather than below.
4. After passing the obstacle, we can then move towards the goal set.

Based on this analysis, here's a suggested new path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Second point (unchanged)
    (4.0, 3.0),    # Breakpoint (unchanged)
    (5.0, 4.5),    # New point to avoid the obstacle by going above it
    (7.0, 4.0),    # New point to start approaching the goal set
    (8.5, 0.5)     # End point in the goal set (unchanged)
]

Explanation of changes:
1. The first three points remain the same, ensuring we start correctly and hit the required breakpoint.
2. We introduce a new point (5.0, 4.5) to move the path above the obstacle. This point is chosen to be sufficiently far from the obstacle's upper edge to avoid intersection.
3. We then add another point (7.0, 4.0) to start bringing the path down towards the goal set. This point is chosen to be past the obstacle horizontally but still high enough to avoid intersecting with it.
4. Finally, we keep the last point (8.5, 0.5) as it correctly ends in the goal set.

This new path should avoid intersecting with the obstacle while still meeting all the other requirements of the task. It starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, passes through a required breakpoint, and should maintain a safe distance from the obstacle throughout its course.
