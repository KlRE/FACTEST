# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.0, 1.0], [8.0, 1.0], [8.0, -0.0], [9.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.0, -4.0), (4.0, 3.0)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

    ]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

[09/10/2024 11:10:34 AM] Based on the provided information and image, I'll propose a path that meets the requirements:

1. The path starts in the blue start set (bottom left).
2. It avoids the diagonal orange obstacle in the middle.
3. It passes through one of the breakpoints (4.0, 3.0).
4. It ends in the green goal set (bottom right).

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point within the start set
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Move diagonally up and right to avoid the obstacle
    (4.0, 3.0),    # Pass through the required breakpoint
    (7.0, 2.0),    # Move right and slightly down to approach the goal
    (8.5, 0.5)     # End point within the goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the blue start quadrilateral.
2. Moves diagonally up and right to avoid the orange obstacle.
3. Passes through the breakpoint (4.0, 3.0) as required.
4. Continues to the right and slightly downwards to approach the goal area.
5. Ends within the green goal quadrilateral.

The path maintains a safe distance from the obstacle and doesn't cross it at any point. It also satisfies the requirement of passing through one of the given breakpoints. The waypoints are chosen to create a smooth path that efficiently navigates from start to goal while meeting all the specified constraints.

[09/10/2024 11:10:42 AM] Thank you for providing the detailed information about the motion planning task and the feedback on the previously generated path. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that addresses the issues.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the previous path were correct.
2. The path correctly passed through one of the breakpoints (4.0, 3.0).
3. The main issue was the segment between (4.0, 3.0) and (7.0, 2.0), which intersected with Obstacle 1.

To correct this, we need to find a way around Obstacle 1 while still passing through one of the breakpoints. Let's consider the spatial relationships:

1. Obstacle 1 is a diagonal quadrilateral that stretches from the bottom-left to the top-right of the space.
2. There's more open space above the obstacle than below it.
3. The breakpoint (4.0, 3.0) is already above most of the obstacle.

Proposed solution:
1. Keep the first three waypoints of the valid subpath: (0.5, 0.5), (2.0, 2.0), (4.0, 3.0).
2. From (4.0, 3.0), move further up to clear the top of the obstacle.
3. Then move right towards the goal area.
4. Finally, move down into the goal area.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start point (unchanged)
    (2.0, 2.0),   # Intermediate point (unchanged)
    (4.0, 3.0),   # Breakpoint (unchanged)
    (5.0, 4.0),   # New point to move above the obstacle
    (7.0, 4.0),   # New point to move towards the goal area
    (8.5, 0.5)    # End point in the goal area (unchanged)
]

This new path should:
1. Start in the correct start set
2. End in the correct goal set
3. Pass through the required breakpoint (4.0, 3.0)
4. Avoid intersecting with Obstacle 1 by moving above it
5. Provide a smooth and feasible trajectory from start to goal

The addition of two new waypoints allows the path to navigate around the obstacle while maintaining a reasonable trajectory. The path now goes higher to avoid the top of the obstacle before moving towards the goal area.

[09/10/2024 11:10:51 AM] Thank you for providing the detailed information and feedback. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the previous path were correct.
2. The path successfully passed through one of the breakpoints (4.0, 3.0).
3. The issue occurs with the segment between (5.0, 4.0) and (7.0, 4.0), which intersects with Obstacle 1.

To correct this, we need to modify the path to go around the obstacle while still passing through the breakpoint (4.0, 3.0). We'll aim to keep the valid subpath up to (5.0, 4.0) and adjust from there.

Proposed solution:
1. Keep the initial part of the path up to (5.0, 4.0).
2. Instead of going straight to (7.0, 4.0), we'll go around the top of the obstacle.
3. After passing the obstacle, we'll curve down towards the goal set.

Here's the thought process for the new path:

1. Start at (0.5, 0.5) within the start set.
2. Move to (2.0, 2.0) as before.
3. Pass through the breakpoint (4.0, 3.0).
4. Continue to (5.0, 4.0) as in the original path.
5. Move to (5.5, 4.5) to start going around the top of the obstacle.
6. Go to (7.5, 4.5) to clear the obstacle completely.
7. Move down to (8.5, 2.0) to approach the goal set.
8. Finally, end at (8.5, 0.5) within the goal set.

This path should avoid intersecting with the obstacle while still meeting all the requirements.

New path:
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (2.0, 2.0),
    (4.0, 3.0),
    (5.0, 4.0),
    (5.5, 4.5),
    (7.5, 4.5),
    (8.5, 2.0),
    (8.5, 0.5)
]

This path starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, passes through the required breakpoint (4.0, 3.0), and should avoid intersecting with the obstacle. The additional waypoints allow for a smoother navigation around the top of the obstacle before descending to the goal set.
