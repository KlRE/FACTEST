# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.0, 1.0], [8.0, 1.0], [8.0, -0.0], [9.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.0, -4.0), (4.0, 3.0)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]

[09/10/2024 11:13:08 AM] Based on the provided information and image, I'll propose a path that meets the requirements:

1. The path starts within the blue start set (bottom left).
2. It avoids the diagonal red obstacle in the center.
3. It passes through one of the breakpoints (4.0, 3.0).
4. It ends within the green goal set (bottom right).

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Move diagonally up and right to avoid the obstacle
    (4.0, 3.0),    # Pass through the required breakpoint
    (7.0, 2.0),    # Move right and slightly down to approach the goal
    (8.5, 0.5)     # End within the goal set
]

This path:
1. Begins safely within the blue start quadrilateral.
2. Moves diagonally up and right to avoid getting too close to the red obstacle.
3. Passes through the breakpoint (4.0, 3.0) as required.
4. Continues to the right and slightly downward, maintaining a safe distance from the obstacle.
5. Ends within the green goal quadrilateral.

The path maintains a safe distance from the obstacle throughout its course, and the linear segments between waypoints do not intersect with the obstacle. The chosen waypoints allow for smooth navigation through the environment while meeting all the specified requirements.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

[09/10/2024 11:13:17 AM] Thank you for providing the detailed information and feedback. I'll analyze the situation and suggest a new path that avoids the obstacle while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct.
2. The path successfully passed through one of the breakpoints (4.0, 3.0).
3. The issue lies in the segment between (4.0, 3.0) and (7.0, 2.0), which intersects with the obstacle.

To correct this, we need to adjust the path to go around the obstacle while still passing through a breakpoint. Let's consider the spatial relationships:

1. The obstacle is a quadrilateral that extends from the bottom of the graph upwards and to the right.
2. We have two breakpoints to choose from: (4.0, -4.0) and (4.0, 3.0).
3. The (4.0, 3.0) breakpoint is closer to our desired path, so let's try to use that one.

New path strategy:
1. Start from the start set.
2. Move towards the (4.0, 3.0) breakpoint as before.
3. From the breakpoint, move upwards to clear the top of the obstacle.
4. Then move towards the goal set, staying above the obstacle.
5. Finally, descend into the goal set.

Based on this analysis, here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point in the start set
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Intermediate point (kept from original path)
    (4.0, 3.0),    # Breakpoint
    (4.0, 4.5),    # Move upwards to clear the obstacle
    (7.0, 4.5),    # Move right, staying above the obstacle
    (8.5, 0.5)     # Descend into the goal set
]

This new path should:
1. Start in the correct start set
2. End in the correct goal set
3. Pass through the breakpoint (4.0, 3.0)
4. Avoid intersecting with the obstacle by going above it

The path now takes a higher route to avoid the obstacle, while still maintaining the key points from the original path. This solution should satisfy all the given requirements and avoid any collisions with the obstacle.
