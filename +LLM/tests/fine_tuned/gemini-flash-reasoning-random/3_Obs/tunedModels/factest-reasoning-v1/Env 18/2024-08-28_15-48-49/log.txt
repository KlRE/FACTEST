# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[17.8, 19.0], [15.7, 17.9], [17.5, 15.7], [18.1, 16.4]]
			Obstacle 2: [[19.3, 6.1], [17.4, 11.1], [17.5, 7.2], [19.2, 5.4]]
			Obstacle 3: [[18.1, 16.2], [7.6, 18.4], [8.3, 16.1], [8.9, 15.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 6.5), (9.0, 20.05)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/28/2024 03:48:56 PM] Here's a possible path that meets the requirements:

**Analysis of the Environment:**

* **Obstacles:** The obstacles are strategically placed to make a direct path from the start to the goal quite difficult.  Obstacle 1 is near the top of the goal area, Obstacle 2 is further down and to the left, and Obstacle 3 is on the right side near the start area. 
* **Breakpoints:** The breakpoint set provides a waypoint that must be included in the path.

**Path Planning:**

1. **Start:** Choose a starting point within the start quadrilateral, for example, (1.0, 1.0).

2. **First Leg:**  Move upwards to avoid Obstacle 3 and towards the first breakpoint. This might look like a straight line from (1.0, 1.0) to (9.0, 6.5).

3. **Breakpoint:** Pass through the breakpoint (9.0, 6.5).

4. **Second Leg:** Move diagonally upwards and rightwards, aiming towards the top-right corner of the goal area. This path should steer clear of Obstacle 2.

5. **Third Leg:**  Once past Obstacle 2, continue moving upwards and rightwards, reaching a waypoint near the top edge of the goal area. This might look like a straight line from the previous waypoint to (18.0, 19.0).

6. **Goal:** Finally, make a short final move downwards and leftwards to reach any point within the goal quadrilateral. 

**Path Format:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 6.5),  # Pass through the first breakpoint
    (18.0, 19.0), # Approach the goal from the top right
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End within the goal set
]
```

**Key Points:**

* The path avoids all obstacles by finding clear passages between them.
* It starts and ends within the designated quadrilaterals.
* It includes the first breakpoint (9.0, 6.5). 

Remember, this is just one possible solution. There might be other valid paths that also meet the requirements.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

]

[08/28/2024 03:49:03 PM] The provided path intersects with obstacles 1 and 3, so we need to adjust it to avoid them. 

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Analyze the Problem:** We need a path from the start set to the goal set, passing through the breakpoint (9.0, 6.5) and avoiding the obstacles.

2. **Start Point:** The path starts at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start set.

3. **First Segment:** The first segment goes from (1.0, 1.0) to (9.0, 6.5). This segment is valid as it does not intersect any obstacles.

4. **Problem Area:**  The second segment goes from (9.0, 6.5) to (18.0, 19.0) and intersects with obstacles 1 and 3.

5. **Obstacle Avoidance:** To avoid the obstacles, we need to find a way to go around them. We can do this by adding waypoints to the path.

**Path Adjustments:**

* Instead of going directly to (18.0, 19.0) from (9.0, 6.5), we can go around obstacle 3 by adding waypoints:
    * From (9.0, 6.5), move downwards to (9.0, 4.0).
    * Then, move rightwards to (20.0, 4.0).
    * Finally, move upwards to (20.0, 20.0), which is within the goal set.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start point
    (9.0, 6.5),     # First breakpoint
    (9.0, 4.0),     # Move downwards
    (20.0, 4.0),    # Move rightwards
    (20.0, 20.0)    # End point in goal set
]
```

This path starts in the start set, passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 6.5), avoids all obstacles, and ends in the goal set.
