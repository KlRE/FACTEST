# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[13.9, 6.0], [16.8, 7.1], [16.4, 16.0], [14.1, 11.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[19.7, 17.5], [17.2, 17.5], [18.2, 17.3], [19.3, 17.3]]
			Obstacle 3: [[10.7, 8.3], [16.3, 0.8], [17.5, 12.2], [16.4, 14.6]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 10.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/28/2024 03:48:00 PM] Here's a possible path solution considering the provided data and requirements:

**Analyzing the Environment:**

* **Start and Goal:**  The start set is a square near the origin, while the goal set is another square in the upper right quadrant of the environment. 
* **Obstacles:** The three obstacles are quadrilaterals, each with a different shape and position. Obstacle 1 is near the start, and the remaining two are closer to the goal.
* **Breakpoint:** The single breakpoint provided is (9.0, 10.0), which lies within the first quadrant and is not directly adjacent to any obstacle.

**Planning the Path:**

1. **Start:** We can choose a point within the start quadrilateral like (1.0, 1.0). 

2. **First Segment:**  This segment must pass through the provided breakpoint (9.0, 10.0) while avoiding the obstacles.  

3. **Avoiding Obstacle 1:** To navigate around Obstacle 1, a slight detour is necessary. This detour can go around the left side of Obstacle 1 by moving upward first and then rightwards. For example, a waypoint like (7.0, 13.0) would be appropriate. 

4. **Second Segment:** This segment should connect to the goal while circumventing Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3. Obstacle 3 poses the most difficulty as it is positioned relatively close to the goal set. 

5. **Maneuvering Around Obstacles 2 and 3:** Obstacle 2 sits in a corner near the goal set, so it can be navigated around by keeping to the left and then coming down diagonally towards the goal. Obstacle 3 poses the biggest challenge, as it has a large width and is near the goal.  One possible way to navigate it is to move around its right side. This may require a slight detour upward before descending to the goal area.

6. **Goal:** Finally, we can end the path by choosing a point within the goal quadrilateral. A point like (19.0, 19.0) should be suitable.

**Proposed Path:**

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),          # Start within the start set
    (7.0, 13.0),        # Avoid Obstacle 1
    (9.0, 10.0),         # Pass through the breakpoint
    (17.0, 19.5),       # Maneuver around Obstacle 2 and 3 
    (19.0, 19.0)         # End within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

* This path successfully navigates around all the obstacles and maintains a safe distance from their edges.
* The path passes through the provided breakpoint (9.0, 10.0) as required.
* The path starts within the start set and ends within the goal set. 

**Important Note:** The chosen waypoints and path segments are just one possible solution. There could be multiple paths that satisfy the given constraints.
