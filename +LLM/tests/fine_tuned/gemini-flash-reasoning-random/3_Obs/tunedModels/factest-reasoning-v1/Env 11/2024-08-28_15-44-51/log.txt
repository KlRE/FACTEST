# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[17.1, 19.3], [15.0, 17.5], [16.1, 16.6], [18.4, 15.4]]
			Obstacle 2: [[15.1, 17.0], [8.1, 16.5], [17.3, 10.5], [18.7, 10.3]]
			Obstacle 3: [[16.7, 19.4], [16.1, 18.0], [16.9, 17.5], [18.0, 16.9]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 6.96), (9.0, 19.28)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/28/2024 03:44:59 PM] Here's a breakdown of how to find a path that satisfies the given requirements:

**1. Understanding the Environment**

* **Start and Goal:** We have a start quadrilateral and a goal quadrilateral, and our path must begin within the start area and end within the goal area.
* **Breakpoints:** We have a set of two breakpoints: (9.0, 6.96) and (9.0, 19.28). Our path needs to go through one of these points.
* **Obstacles:**  We have three quadrilateral obstacles. Our path cannot cross or touch any of these obstacles.

**2. Visualizing the Solution**

It's helpful to sketch the environment with the start/goal regions and the obstacles. This will make it easier to visualize potential paths.

**3. Planning the Path**

Here's a possible path that meets the requirements:

1. **Start:** Begin at a point within the start quadrilateral, for example, at (1.0, 1.0).
2. **Move towards a breakpoint:** Move diagonally upwards to reach the breakpoint (9.0, 19.28).
3. **Avoid obstacle 1:**  Navigate around the first obstacle (Obstacle 1).  Since we want a non-crossing path, keep a safe distance from the obstacle. A slight adjustment to the y-coordinate might be necessary to clear it.
4. **Navigate to the goal region:** From the breakpoint, move towards the goal quadrilateral.
5. **Reach the goal:**  End the path at a point within the goal quadrilateral, for example, at (19.0, 19.0).

**Possible Path (new_path):**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 19.28), # Pass through the breakpoint
    (10.0, 21.0), # Navigate around obstacle 1
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

* **Waypoint (1.0, 1.0):**  Starts within the start quadrilateral.
* **Waypoint (9.0, 19.28):** Passes through the selected breakpoint.
* **Waypoint (10.0, 21.0):**  Navigates around Obstacle 1 while ensuring no intersection. 
* **Waypoint (19.0, 19.0):**  Ends within the goal quadrilateral.

**Important Notes:**

* **Linear Segments:** The path consists of straight line segments connecting the waypoints.
* **Safety Margin:** Ensure the path maintains a safe distance from the obstacles to avoid collisions. 

By carefully choosing waypoints and considering the spatial constraints of the environment, we can plan a successful path that adheres to all the given requirements.
