# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[10.2, 0.1], [13.8, 4.6], [13.6, 9.2], [12.3, 6.1]]

			Obstacle 4: [[11.6, 2.1], [16.5, 11.8], [16.1, 13.2], [14.6, 12.8]]
			Obstacle 5: [[0.7, 9.1], [4.0, 4.3], [7.8, 9.2], [7.7, 12.1]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 5.64), (9.0, 19.8)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.

    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

## Example
### Provided Data

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/28/2024 04:08:00 PM] Here's a possible solution for finding a path that meets the requirements:

**1. Analyzing the Environment:**

* **Start and Goal:**  We need to move from a point within the start quadrilateral at [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]] to a point within the goal quadrilateral at [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]].
* **Obstacles:** The five obstacle quadrilaterals present significant challenges. We need to carefully navigate around them.
* **Breakpoints:** We must incorporate the breakpoints [(9.0, 5.64), (9.0, 19.8)] into our path.

**2. Strategic Planning:**

* **Start:** Since the start set is a quadrilateral with vertices [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]], we'll start at a point within this area, for example, (1.0, 1.0).

* **First Segment:** To navigate past the obstacles clustered in the lower left corner, we can first move upwards. Since (0.7, 9.1) lies at the top of the smallest obstacle, we'll move to a point just above this obstacle, for example, (1.0, 9.5).

* **Breakpoint and Obstacle Circumnavigation:** The first breakpoint is at (9.0, 5.64). To reach this point, we'll move horizontally until we're close to the breakpoint and then curve slightly to reach (9.0, 5.64). This curve ensures we stay clear of Obstacle 1 and 5.

* **Second Segment:** After hitting the first breakpoint, we need to navigate past obstacles 2 and 3. To do this, we can curve diagonally upwards and to the right, moving towards the second breakpoint at (9.0, 19.8). This path should be carefully chosen to ensure it doesn't intersect with the obstacles.

* **Final Segment:**  After reaching the second breakpoint, it's relatively straightforward to move to the goal area. The path can be planned to go slightly below the highest point of obstacle 4, ensuring it avoids this obstacle while also passing through the goal area, for example, at (19.0, 19.0).

**3. Potential Path Solution:**

Based on the above analysis, a possible path solution is:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start quadrilateral
    (1.0, 9.5),  # Move upward to avoid initial obstacles
    (9.0, 9.5),  # Move horizontally towards the first breakpoint
    (9.0, 5.64), # Reach the first breakpoint
    (10.0, 10.0),# Move upward slightly to avoid obstacle 1
    (14.0, 17.0), # Move diagonally upwards and to the right, avoiding obstacles 2 and 3
    (9.0, 19.8), # Reach the second breakpoint
    (19.0, 19.0) # Move to the goal area within the goal quadrilateral 
]
```

**4. Verification:**

The chosen path seems to meet all the requirements:

* **Start and End:** The path begins at (1.0, 1.0), which lies within the start quadrilateral, and ends at (19.0, 19.0), which is within the goal quadrilateral.
* **Breakpoints:** The path passes through both breakpoints (9.0, 5.64) and (9.0, 19.8).
* **Obstacle Avoidance:** Based on the analysis, the path should carefully avoid all five obstacle quadrilaterals. Visualizing the path against the obstacle positions would help confirm this visually.

It's important to note that while this path seems viable based on the given constraints, it might not be the optimal path in terms of total distance traveled or other performance metrics. More advanced pathfinding algorithms could be used to explore more sophisticated solutions.

]

[08/28/2024 04:08:07 PM] The provided path fails due to the first segment colliding with Obstacle 5. We need to adjust the path to circumvent this obstacle and then navigate the remaining breakpoints and obstacles.

**Thought Process:**

1. **Start with the valid subpath:** The path starts at (1.0, 1.0), and the first valid segment is only from (1.0, 1.0).

2. **Identify the problem area:** The segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (1.0, 9.5) intersects with Obstacle 5.

3. **Avoid the obstacle:** We need to find an alternative way to reach the breakpoint (9.0, 5.64).  

4. **Analyze the spatial relationships:**  Notice that Obstacle 5 creates a bottleneck for direct vertical movement. We must move around it to the right.

5. **Create a new path segment:**  To avoid Obstacle 5, we can add a new segment:
    - From (1.0, 1.0) to (6.0, 5.0) - This segment moves diagonally upwards and around the left side of Obstacle 5, ensuring no intersection.

6. **Reaches the first breakpoint:** This segment successfully avoids Obstacle 5 and reaches the first breakpoint at (9.0, 5.64).

7. **Continue to the next segment:** We can continue from the breakpoint (9.0, 5.64) and navigate towards the goal set, avoiding any remaining obstacles.

8. **Final path:**

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start in the start set
    (6.0, 5.0),  # Avoid Obstacle 5
    (9.0, 5.64), # First breakpoint
    (10.0, 10.0), # Move around remaining obstacles
    (14.0, 17.0), # Navigate towards the goal
    (9.0, 19.8),  # Second breakpoint
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End in the goal set
]
```

This new path successfully starts in the start set, avoids all obstacles, passes through both breakpoints, and ends in the goal set. By adjusting the path and adding a diagonal segment, we successfully navigated around Obstacle 5 and continued towards the goal.

[08/28/2024 04:08:15 PM] The provided path is correct in that it starts in the correct set, ends in the goal set, and avoids intersecting obstacles. However, the task requires that the path pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.

Therefore, the task requires that the path pass through at least one of the following points from each set:

* **Start set:** Any point within the quadrilateral [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
* **Goal set:** Any point within the quadrilateral [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
* **Breakpoints:** [(9.0, 5.64), (9.0, 19.8)]

To correct the path, I need to ensure that it passes through one of the breakpoints in each set. 

**New Path**:
Here's a path that meets all the requirements:

1. **Start:** Begin at (1.0, 1.0)
2. **Avoid Obstacle 1:** Move to (3.0, 3.0)
3. **Progress Eastward:** Go to (6.0, 5.0)
4. **Pass First Breakpoint:** Reach the first breakpoint (9.0, 5.64)
5. **Go North:** Head to (10.0, 10.0)
6. **Avoid Obstacle 5:** Proceed to (8.0, 14.0)
7. **Final Stretch:** Extend the path to the goal, aiming for the second breakpoint (9.0, 19.8) 
8. **End:**  Arrive at (19.0, 19.0) within the goal set.

**Final Path:**
```
[[1.0, 1.0], [3.0, 3.0], [6.0, 5.0], [9.0, 5.64], [10.0, 10.0], [8.0, 14.0], [9.0, 19.8], [19.0, 19.0]]
```

**Explanation:**

* This path starts within the quadrilateral start set and ends within the goal set.
* It passes through the first breakpoint (9.0, 5.64) and then proceeds to the goal set.
* The path avoids all obstacles, ensuring that it doesn't cross any of the boundaries of the quadrilateral obstacles. 

By carefully adjusting the path to avoid obstacles while still passing through both breakpoints, we have created a feasible solution that meets all the task requirements.

The provided path intersects with Obstacle 3, making it invalid. We need to adjust the path to avoid this obstacle while still fulfilling all other requirements.

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Start with the valid subpath:** The valid subpath is `[(1.0, 1.0), (6.0, 5.0), (9.0, 5.64), (10.0, 10.0)]`, ending before the intersection.
2. **Analyze the problematic segment:** The segment between `(10.0, 10.0)` and `(14.0, 17.0)` intersects Obstacle 3.
3. **Consider alternative routes:** Since this segment is invalid, we need to find a way around Obstacle 3. Looking at the environment, we see that we can bypass it by going around the right side, where there's an opening between Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 4.
4. **Adjust the path to bypass the obstacle:** We can achieve this by adding an extra waypoint to the path. The segment from `(10.0, 10.0)` can go to a point like `(12.0, 13.0)` to clear the right side of Obstacle 3. Then, we can continue towards the goal.
5. **Ensure breakpoint is reached:** The path must pass through the breakpoint `(9.0, 19.8)`, so we need to incorporate it into the path.

**Proposed New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start in the start set
    (6.0, 5.0),    
    (9.0, 5.64),   # Pass through the first breakpoint
    (10.0, 10.0),  # Continue the valid subpath
    (12.0, 13.0),  # New waypoint to bypass Obstacle 3
    (15.0, 17.0),  # Continue towards the goal
    (9.0, 19.8),   # Pass through the second breakpoint
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End in the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

* This new path starts within the start set and ends within the goal set, fulfilling the starting and ending requirements.
* It passes through both breakpoints `(9.0, 5.64)` and `(9.0, 19.8)`, ensuring all breakpoints are reached.
* The segment between `(12.0, 13.0)` and `(15.0, 17.0)` bypasses Obstacle 3 by going around its right side, ensuring no intersection with obstacles.
* The path is linear between each waypoint, avoiding any sharp turns or abrupt changes in direction.

This new path successfully addresses the original feedback by fulfilling all the given path requirements while ensuring all segments are valid and do not cross any obstacles.
