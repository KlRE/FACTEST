# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.3, 13.8], [15.9, 7.8], [17.9, 7.8], [15.5, 16.3]]
			Obstacle 2: [[12.7, 15.1], [17.4, 18.1], [15.8, 18.7], [13.5, 18.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[2.4, 18.4], [9.7, 16.2], [13.7, 15.7], [11.4, 17.5]]
			Obstacle 4: [[3.8, 19.2], [4.4, 12.9], [5.3, 15.6], [4.0, 19.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 7.2), (9.0, 19.87)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/28/2024 04:01:39 PM] Here's a possible path solution for this problem:

**Path Analysis:**

1. **Start:** We start within the quadrilateral defined by vertices [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]. Let's choose a starting point within this quadrilateral, for example, (1.0, 1.0).

2. **Navigating to the First Breakpoint:** From (1.0, 1.0), we need to reach the first breakpoint at (9.0, 7.2). This can be achieved by moving linearly to (2.5, 6.2) to avoid obstacle 4. From there, we can move diagonally to the first breakpoint (9.0, 7.2) while staying clear of obstacle 2 and 3.

3. **Moving to the Goal:** From the first breakpoint (9.0, 7.2), we can directly move towards the goal quadrilateral. However, obstacles 1 and 2 are in the way.  We need to navigate around them carefully.  Let's move horizontally to (18.0, 7.2), keeping a safe distance from obstacle 1, and then proceed towards the goal while avoiding obstacle 2. A diagonal path to (19.0, 19.0) would meet this requirement.

**Final Path Array:**

Therefore, the complete path can be represented as the following array of waypoints:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start in the start set
    (2.5, 6.2),   # Move towards the first breakpoint
    (9.0, 7.2),   # First breakpoint
    (18.0, 7.2),  # Navigate around the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End in the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

* **Waypoint 1:** Starting at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start set.
* **Waypoint 2:**  Moving diagonally to (2.5, 6.2), avoiding all obstacles.
* **Waypoint 3:** Reaching the first breakpoint (9.0, 7.2) as required.
* **Waypoint 4:** Moving to (18.0, 7.2), ensuring to stay clear of obstacle 1.
* **Waypoint 5:**  Reaching the goal quadrilateral by moving diagonally to (19.0, 19.0). 

This path meets all the specified requirements: 

* Starts in the start set.
* Ends in the goal set.
* Passes through one of the breakpoints.
* Does not intersect any obstacles.
