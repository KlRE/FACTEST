# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[0.6, 12.5], [8.2, 8.5], [9.6, 17.3], [1.6, 13.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[13.6, 16.4], [14.7, 11.9], [17.0, 15.6], [15.8, 17.3]]
			Obstacle 3: [[2.3, 7.2], [9.7, 0.9], [12.2, 14.1], [9.7, 14.3]]
			Obstacle 4: [[14.3, 18.0], [10.8, 19.7], [11.4, 15.8], [14.0, 16.5]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, -0.26), (9.0, 19.52)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/28/2024 03:51:45 PM] Here's a possible solution for the motion planning task, keeping in mind the provided data and requirements:

**Path Analysis:**

1. **Start and End:** We need a path starting within the start set ([[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]) and ending within the goal set ([[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]).

2. **Obstacle Avoidance:** We must ensure that the path avoids intersecting any of the provided obstacles.

3. **Breakpoints:** We have to incorporate one breakpoint from each set: Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, -0.26), (9.0, 19.52)].

**Path Planning:**

A possible path that satisfies all the requirements is:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (9.0, -0.26),  # Pass through the first breakpoint
    (15.0, 7.0),  # Navigate around Obstacle 3
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Starting Point:** We begin at (1.0, 1.0), which is clearly inside the start set.

2. **First Breakpoint:** The path then moves to (9.0, -0.26), which is the first breakpoint.

3. **Obstacle Avoidance:** To circumvent the obstacles, we can move upwards and around the right side of Obstacle 3. The waypoint (15.0, 7.0) achieves this, keeping a safe distance from the obstacle.

4. **Goal Point:** Finally, we reach (19.0, 19.0), safely within the goal set.

**Spatial Relationships:**

The key to this solution lies in understanding the spatial relationships between the start, goal sets, breakpoints, and obstacles. By analyzing the coordinates and visualizing the environment, we can strategically choose waypoints that steer the path clear of obstacles while adhering to all the given constraints.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible solution. Depending on the specific constraints and desired path characteristics, other solutions may exist.
