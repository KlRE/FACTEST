# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[18.9, 12.3], [6.5, 2.5], [7.1, 2.0], [14.7, 3.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[12.7, 10.4], [19.9, 11.6], [15.7, 18.3], [14.6, 18.9]]
			Obstacle 3: [[17.8, 13.7], [13.8, 9.5], [14.3, 6.6], [18.0, 1.6]]
			Obstacle 4: [[11.1, 5.3], [19.1, 9.0], [14.1, 13.9], [12.4, 14.8]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 0.12), (9.0, 13.24)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/28/2024 04:01:47 PM] Here's a breakdown of how to plan a path that meets all the requirements:

**1. Visualize the Environment**

It's helpful to sketch the start and goal positions, obstacles, and breakpoints on a coordinate plane. This will give you a clear picture of the space and potential routes.

**2. Analyze the Start and Goal Areas**

* **Start:** We have a quadrilateral with vertices at [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]. We can choose any point within this quadrilateral as our starting point.
* **Goal:**  The goal quadrilateral has vertices at [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]].  We want to end at a point within this quadrilateral.

**3. Focus on the Breakpoints**

We have one set of breakpoints: [[9.0, 0.12], [9.0, 13.24]].  Our path must pass through one of these points.

**4. Obstacle Considerations**

We need to ensure our path doesn't intersect any of the four obstacle quadrilaterals. 

**5. Plan the Path**

* **Starting Point:** Choose a point within the start quadrilateral. Let's say we start at (1.0, 1.0).
* **Waypoint 1 (Breakpoint):** We need to pass through a breakpoint. Let's choose (9.0, 13.24).
* **Navigating the Obstacles:** From the breakpoint, we need to carefully navigate around the obstacles. 
* **Goal Point:** Finally, we need to reach a point within the goal quadrilateral.  Let's say we aim for (19.0, 19.0).

**6.  A Possible Path**

Based on the spatial relationships and requirements, here's a possible path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),         # Start
    (9.0, 13.24),       # Breakpoint 1
    (14.31, 22.0),      # Navigate above Obstacle 3 and 4
    (19.0, 19.0)        # Goal
]
```

**Explanation:**

* This path starts within the start quadrilateral and ends within the goal quadrilateral.
* It passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 13.24).
* The path avoids crossing any of the obstacles.

**Important Note:**  There might be other valid paths. The key is to carefully analyze the spatial relationships and find a path that satisfies all the constraints.
