# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[11.4, 18.3], [10.0, 15.9], [10.3, 15.8], [11.8, 16.9]]
			Obstacle 2: [[4.8, 9.5], [9.0, 0.3], [10.5, 0.8], [7.3, 9.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, -0.85), (9.0, 13.32)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/28/2024 03:36:24 PM] Here's a breakdown of how to plan a path that meets the requirements:

**Understanding the Environment**

* **Start and Goal Sets:**  We have quadrilaterals defining the starting and ending zones.
* **Obstacles:** Two quadrilateral obstacles are present that the path must avoid.
* **Breakpoints:** We have two breakpoints that the path must pass through, which are useful for defining specific points in the environment.

**Path Planning Approach**

1. **Start Point:** Choose a point within the start quadrilateral, for example, the center point: `(1.0, 1.0)`.

2. **First Breakpoint:** Navigate from the starting point to the first breakpoint `(9.0, -0.85)`. This segment will be relatively straightforward as there are no obstacles directly in the way.

3. **Circumventing Obstacle 2:** To avoid Obstacle 2, the path must maneuver around it.  A good strategy is to move upwards to a point that is clear of the obstacle. For instance, we could add a waypoint at `(9.0, 9.5)`, which sits above Obstacle 2 and below the top of the start set.

4. **Second Breakpoint:** From the waypoint at `(9.0, 9.5)`, the path can proceed to the second breakpoint `(9.0, 13.32)`. This segment should be relatively clear.

5. **Approaching the Goal:** After passing through the second breakpoint, the path can navigate towards the goal set.  It will likely be necessary to move in a way that avoids Obstacle 1. For example, the path could continue to the left, moving slightly downwards to clear Obstacle 1.

6. **End Point:**  Finally, choose a point within the goal quadrilateral to end the path. 

**Proposed Path:**

Based on the above strategy, a possible path could look like this:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (9.0, -0.85),  # First breakpoint
    (9.0, 9.5),   # Waypoint to circumvent Obstacle 2
    (9.0, 13.32),  # Second breakpoint
    (15.0, 15.0),  # Approaching the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set
]
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Visualize:** Drawing a diagram of the environment and potential path helps immensely in planning.
* **Obstacle Avoidance:**  Ensure there's a safe distance between the path and all obstacles.
* **Segment Length:**  The path should not have any extremely long or short segments that could make the solution less efficient.

[08/28/2024 03:36:31 PM] The provided path has a problem with the second segment: it intersects with Obstacle 2. We need to adjust the path to avoid this obstacle.

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Analyze the valid subpath:** The first segment [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, -0.85)] is valid.
2. **Identify the issue:** The second segment [(9.0, -0.85), (9.0, 9.5)] intersects Obstacle 2.
3. **Find a way around the obstacle:** There is a gap between the top of Obstacle 2 and the first breakpoint. We can use this gap to bypass the obstacle.
4. **Adjust the path:** We can add a waypoint to the path that goes around the obstacle, ensuring we pass through the first breakpoint.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), # start in the start set
    (9.0, -0.85), # first breakpoint
    (10.0, -0.85), # move slightly right to avoid Obstacle 2
    (10.0, 13.32), # move upwards to the second breakpoint
    (15.0, 15.0), # intermediate waypoint towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0) # end in the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

This new path starts in the start set, passes through the first breakpoint (9.0, -0.85), and then moves slightly right to (10.0, -0.85) to avoid Obstacle 2. It then continues upwards to the second breakpoint (10.0, 13.32) and finally reaches the goal set.

This path satisfies all the requirements: it starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, avoids all obstacles, and passes through both breakpoints.

[08/28/2024 03:36:39 PM] The provided path intersects with Obstacle 2, specifically the segment between waypoints (10.0, -0.85) and (10.0, 13.32). 

Here's a breakdown of the problem and the adjustments needed:

1. **Spatial Analysis:**
   - Obstacle 2 sits in the lower-left quadrant and partially blocks any vertical movement upwards from the first breakpoint (9.0, -0.85).
   - The goal area is located in the upper-right quadrant, and Obstacle 1 obstructs any direct path upwards and to the right.

2. **Adjusting the Path:**
   - Since we're required to use the breakpoints, we need to navigate around Obstacle 2. 
   - The valid subpath up to (10.0, -0.85) can be extended.
   - Instead of going vertically upwards to (10.0, 13.32), we can move to the right first, then upwards to the second breakpoint (9.0, 13.32).

3. **New Path:**
   - The path needs to move around Obstacle 2 while passing through both breakpoints. 
   - One possible way to achieve this is by adding waypoints to guide the path:
   
   ```
   new_path = [
       (1.0, 1.0),         # Start point 
       (9.0, -0.85),      # First Breakpoint
       (12.0, -0.85),      # Move rightwards 
       (12.0, 5.0),      # Move upwards, avoiding Obstacle 2
       (9.0, 13.32),      # Second Breakpoint
       (15.0, 15.0),      # Move towards the goal
       (19.0, 19.0)       # End point 
   ]
   ```

**Explanation:**

- The path now moves from the start point to the first breakpoint (9.0, -0.85) as before.
- Instead of moving vertically, the path moves to the right (12.0, -0.85) to avoid Obstacle 2.
- Then, the path moves upwards to (12.0, 5.0), ensuring it's clear of the obstacle.
- The path then moves to the second breakpoint (9.0, 13.32).
- Finally, the path continues towards the goal area, ending at (19.0, 19.0).
