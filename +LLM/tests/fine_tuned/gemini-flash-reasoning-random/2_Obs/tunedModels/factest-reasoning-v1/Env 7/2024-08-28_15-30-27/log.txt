# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[19.4, 10.7], [17.7, 10.6], [18.5, 0.5], [19.7, 0.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[5.9, 3.7], [16.0, 1.2], [17.3, 6.8], [14.7, 7.9]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 0.47), (9.0, 13.58)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/28/2024 03:30:35 PM] Here's a breakdown of how to find a path that meets all the requirements:

**1. Analyzing the Environment**

* **Start and Goal Sets:** The start set is a 2x2 square near the origin, and the goal set is a 2x2 square in the top right corner of the environment.
* **Obstacles:** Obstacle 1 is a small quadrilateral near the goal set, while Obstacle 2 is larger and positioned diagonally across the environment.
* **Breakpoints:**  There's a set of two breakpoints, both with the same x-coordinate (9.0) but different y-coordinates. This indicates a vertical movement is required near x = 9.0.

**2. Path Planning**

1. **Start Point:** Choose a point within the start set, for example, (1.0, 1.0).
2. **First Breakpoint:**  Select the breakpoint with a higher y-coordinate (9.0, 13.58). To reach this breakpoint, the path should move in a mostly upward direction while avoiding Obstacle 2. 
3. **Navigate around Obstacle 2:**  A possible way to bypass Obstacle 2 is to move around its left side.  This can involve a series of waypoints that adjust to the obstacle's shape.
4. **Second Breakpoint:** After moving around Obstacle 2, select the second breakpoint (9.0, 0.47). This will require moving downwards.
5. **Approach the Goal Set:**  From the second breakpoint, the path can move horizontally towards the goal set while maintaining a safe distance from Obstacle 1.
6. **End Point:**  Finally, the path can enter the goal set, for example, at the point (19.0, 19.0).

**3. Proposed Path**

Based on the above analysis, a possible path could be:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start
    (4.0, 4.0),  # Move upwards and slightly to the right 
    (6.0, 11.0), # Move further upwards, navigating around Obstacle 2 
    (9.0, 13.58), # Reach the first breakpoint
    (9.0, 2.0), # Move downwards to the second breakpoint
    (17.0, 2.0), # Move horizontally towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0) # End in the goal set
]
```

**4. Verification**

This path:

* **Starts and ends in the correct sets.**
* **Passes through both breakpoints.**
* **Avoids all obstacles by keeping a safe distance.**
* **Does not intersect itself.**

**Remember:** There might be other valid paths that also satisfy the requirements. The key is to carefully consider the spatial relationships between obstacles, breakpoints, and the start and goal sets to ensure a safe and efficient path.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/28/2024 03:30:42 PM] The provided path intersects with Obstacle 2, specifically with the segment connecting (9.0, 13.58) and (9.0, 2.0). We need to adjust the path to avoid this obstacle.

### Analysis

* The valid subpath ends at (9.0, 13.58).
* The path then tries to go straight down, intersecting Obstacle 2.
* We need to find a way to bypass Obstacle 2 by going around it, either to the left or right. 

### Adjusting the Path

Let's try going around Obstacle 2 to the left:

1. **From (9.0, 13.58):** Move slightly to the left and up to avoid the top left corner of Obstacle 2.
2. **Move up and left:**  This will take us clear of the obstacle.
3. **Move down and right:** Once we're clear of the obstacle, we can move down and then right to reach the goal set.

### New Path

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (4.0, 4.0),
    (6.0, 11.0),
    (9.0, 13.58),
    (8.0, 14.0),  # Move slightly left and up to avoid Obstacle 2
    (7.0, 16.0),  # Move further up and left
    (9.0, 17.0),  # Move slightly down and right
    (17.0, 17.0),  # Move right towards the goal 
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End in the goal set 
]
```

This adjusted path avoids Obstacle 2 while still starting in the start set, passing through the breakpoints, and ending in the goal set.
