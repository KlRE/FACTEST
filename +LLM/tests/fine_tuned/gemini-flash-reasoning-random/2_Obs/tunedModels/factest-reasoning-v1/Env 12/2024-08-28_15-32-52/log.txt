# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.2, 15.4], [18.4, 16.0], [13.7, 16.4], [9.9, 16.1]]
			Obstacle 2: [[19.7, 15.5], [16.5, 14.0], [16.5, 12.6], [16.8, 10.9]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 6.76), (9.0, 18.96)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/28/2024 03:32:59 PM] Here's a possible path solution, keeping in mind the constraints and requirements:

**Path Analysis:**

1. **Start Point:**  We can start at the midpoint of the start quadrilateral, which would be approximately (1.0, 1.0).

2. **Breakpoint 1:** The path must pass through one of the breakpoints in the first set, which is either (9.0, 6.76) or (9.0, 18.96). We can choose (9.0, 6.76) as it provides a more direct path to the goal area while avoiding the obstacles.

3. **Obstacle Avoidance:** To reach the chosen breakpoint, we need to navigate around Obstacle 1.  This can be achieved by taking a slightly curved path upwards and to the right.

4. **Goal Point:**  From the breakpoint, we can take a more direct path towards the goal quadrilateral. Since the goal area is open, we can simply move towards its center, which would be approximately (19.0, 19.0).

**Path Array:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (4.5, 4.5),   # Intermediate point to avoid Obstacle 1
    (9.0, 6.76),  # Pass through the chosen breakpoint
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End within the goal set
]
```

**Verification:**

* **Non-Crossing:**  This path avoids intersecting any of the obstacle quadrilaterals. It keeps a safe distance, ensuring no segments touch the obstacle boundaries.
* **Breakpoints:** The path includes the chosen breakpoint (9.0, 6.76).
* **Start and End:**  The path starts within the start quadrilateral and ends within the goal quadrilateral.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/28/2024 03:33:05 PM] The provided path intersects with Obstacle 1, which is not allowed. We need to adjust the path to avoid this obstacle while ensuring it still passes through the required breakpoint and reaches the goal set. 

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Identify the Problem:** The path intersects with Obstacle 1 between the third and fourth waypoints. 
2. **Analyze the Environment:**  Obstacle 1 is positioned in a way that makes it difficult to move around it directly. 
3. **Consider Alternatives:** We need to find a new path segment to reach the goal without crossing Obstacle 1. This segment must pass through the required breakpoint. 
4. **Find a Valid Path:** We can adjust the path to move upwards and then downwards, circumventing Obstacle 1 while still passing through the breakpoint.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start in the start set
    (4.5, 4.5),  # Move towards the breakpoint
    (9.0, 6.76), # Pass through the required breakpoint
    (9.0, 19.0), # Move upwards to avoid Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 19.0) # Move rightwards and reach the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

- The path starts and ends in the correct sets.
- It passes through the required breakpoint  `(9.0, 6.76)`.
- By adding an additional waypoint  `(9.0, 19.0)`, the path moves upwards, avoiding Obstacle 1.
- The final segment then moves rightwards to reach the goal set.

This new path fulfills all the requirements: it starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, passes through the breakpoint, and avoids all obstacles.

]

[08/28/2024 03:33:12 PM] The provided path is incorrect because the third segment intersects with Obstacle 1. We need to adjust the path to avoid this obstacle.

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Analyze the Valid Subpath:** The path starts at (1.0, 1.0), goes through (4.5, 4.5) and reaches the first breakpoint (9.0, 6.76). This subpath is valid as it doesn't intersect any obstacles.

2. **Identify the Problem:** The next segment from (9.0, 6.76) to (9.0, 19.0) intersects Obstacle 1.

3. **Find a Solution:** To avoid Obstacle 1, we need to find a path that goes around it. We can do this by adding a waypoint that bypasses the obstacle.

**Path Adjustments:**

* **Bypass Obstacle 1:** We can add a waypoint to the path that goes around the left side of Obstacle 1.  Since Obstacle 1 has a vertex at (6.2, 15.4), we can add a waypoint at (6.0, 15.0) to ensure we stay clear of the obstacle.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (4.5, 4.5), 
    (9.0, 6.76), 
    (6.0, 15.0),  # New waypoint to bypass Obstacle 1
    (9.0, 19.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0) 
]
```

**Explanation:**

The new path now goes around Obstacle 1 by adding the waypoint (6.0, 15.0). This segment avoids any intersection with the obstacle. The rest of the path remains unchanged, ensuring it starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and passes through the necessary breakpoints.

    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/28/2024 03:33:20 PM] The provided path intersects with Obstacle 1, making it invalid. We need to adjust the path to avoid this obstacle. 

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Analyze the valid subpath:** The segment between (1.0, 1.0) and (6.0, 15.0) is valid. This means we need to find a way to circumvent Obstacle 1 from this point. 

2. **Consider the breakpoint:**  We need to pass through one of the breakpoints, (9.0, 6.76) or (9.0, 18.96). 

3. **Spatial relationship:** Obstacle 1 is located around the coordinates (13.7, 16.4). We can try to move around it by going through the first breakpoint.

4. **Proposed adjustment:** We can try to move the path from (6.0, 15.0) to (9.0, 6.76) and then continue towards the goal. 

5. **Check for intersections:** We need to make sure this adjustment doesn't cause any new intersections with Obstacle 2 or other obstacles.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (4.5, 4.5), 
    (9.0, 6.76), 
    (10.0, 15.0), # Move slightly right of Obstacle 1
    (12.0, 17.0), # Move upwards and away from Obstacle 1
    (16.0, 19.0), # Move towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End in the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation:**

* We use the valid subpath up to (6.0, 15.0).
* From (6.0, 15.0), we move to (9.0, 6.76) to pass through the breakpoint.
* We then move to (10.0, 15.0) to avoid Obstacle 1.
* Finally, we move upwards and towards the goal set, ensuring a clear path.

This new path satisfies all the requirements:

* Starts in the start set.
* Ends in the goal set.
* Passes through a breakpoint.
* Avoids all obstacles.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data

[08/28/2024 03:33:27 PM] The provided path is incorrect because the segment between (10.0, 15.0) and (12.0, 17.0) intersects with Obstacle 1.  Here's the breakdown and the corrected path:

**Analysis:**

1. **Start and End Points:** The path starts correctly within the start set and ends correctly in the goal set.
2. **Breakpoints:** The path includes the breakpoint (9.0, 6.76) from Breakpoint Set 1.
3. **Obstacle Intersection:** The segment between (10.0, 15.0) and (12.0, 17.0) directly intersects with Obstacle 1. This is the primary issue.

**Path Adjustments:**

To address the obstacle intersection, we need to find a detour around Obstacle 1 while staying within the boundaries of the start and goal sets and utilizing the breakpoints.

**Corrected Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start
    (4.5, 4.5), 
    (9.0, 6.76),  # Breakpoint
    (10.0, 15.0),  # Reach a point near Obstacle 1 
    (10.0, 17.5),  # Move slightly upwards to avoid Obstacle 1
    (12.0, 19.0),  # Move right and slightly up to approach the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End in the goal set
]
```

**Explanation of Adjustments:**

- **Avoid Obstacle 1:** After reaching the breakpoint (9.0, 6.76), instead of proceeding directly to (12.0, 17.0), we move slightly upwards to (10.0, 17.5) to bypass Obstacle 1.
- **Approach Goal:**  The next waypoint is set to (12.0, 19.0), moving right and slightly up to safely approach the goal set.
- **End in Goal:** Finally, the path ends at (19.0, 19.0) within the goal set.

This corrected path ensures it starts within the start set, ends within the goal set, includes the breakpoint, and avoids intersecting any obstacles.

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

]

[08/28/2024 03:33:34 PM] The provided path intersects with Obstacle 1, specifically between the waypoints (10.0, 15.0) and (10.0, 17.5). We need to adjust the path to avoid this obstacle while still adhering to the given requirements.

### Analysis:

1. **Valid Subpath:** The path from (1.0, 1.0) to (10.0, 15.0) is valid as it does not intersect any obstacles.
2. **Obstacle 1:**  Obstacle 1 is positioned in a way that prevents a direct vertical movement upwards from (10.0, 15.0) to (10.0, 17.5).
3. **Alternative Route:** We can circumvent Obstacle 1 by moving horizontally and then upwards.

### Path Adjustments:

1. **Continue from Valid Subpath:**  Starting from (10.0, 15.0), we can move horizontally to the right.
2. **Avoid Obstacle 1:**  To avoid the top right corner of Obstacle 1, we can move slightly to the right before moving upwards.
3. **Reach Breakpoint:** We need to pass through one of the breakpoints in Set 1. Since the breakpoint (9.0, 18.96) is within the goal set, we can adjust the path to reach this breakpoint.

### New Path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  
    (4.5, 4.5), 
    (9.0, 6.76),  
    (10.0, 15.0),  
    (12.0, 15.0), # Move right to avoid Obstacle 1
    (12.0, 18.0), # Move upwards 
    (9.0, 18.96), # Reach the breakpoint 
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End in the goal set
]
```

This new path:

- Starts within the start set.
- Ends within the goal set.
- Passes through the required breakpoint.
- Avoids all obstacles by maintaining a safe distance.
