# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[5.2, 6.1], [14.0, 9.4], [10.9, 12.2], [9.7, 11.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[15.7, 7.5], [17.8, 0.1], [18.1, 10.5], [16.2, 14.8]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 2.76), (9.0, 16.45)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:

        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/28/2024 03:30:11 PM] Here's a breakdown of how to plan a path from the provided start set to the goal set, ensuring it avoids the obstacles and passes through one breakpoint from each set:

**1. Understanding the Environment:**

* **Start Set:**  The path must originate from a point within the quadrilateral defined by vertices [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]. 
* **Goal Set:** The path needs to terminate at a point within the quadrilateral defined by [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]].
* **Obstacles:**  We have two obstacles represented as quadrilaterals:
    * Obstacle 1: [[5.2, 6.1], [14.0, 9.4], [10.9, 12.2], [9.7, 11.8]]
    * Obstacle 2: [[15.7, 7.5], [17.8, 0.1], [18.1, 10.5], [16.2, 14.8]]
* **Breakpoints:** We have one breakpoint set: [[9.0, 2.76], [9.0, 16.45]]. The path must pass through one of these points.

**2. Visualizing the Path:**

Imagine plotting the start set, goal set, obstacles, and breakpoints on a 2D plane. This will help you visualize the available space and potential obstacles.

**3. Planning the Path:**

* **Start:** Begin from a point within the start set, such as (1.0, 1.0).
* **Avoid Obstacles:**  The key is to navigate through the gaps between the obstacles.
* **Breakpoint:** Choose one of the breakpoints. Let's select (9.0, 2.76).
* **Goal:** End at a point within the goal set, such as (19.0, 19.0).

**4. Path Construction:**

Consider the following path segments:

* **Segment 1:** (1.0, 1.0) to (9.0, 2.76). This segment starts within the start set, avoids obstacles, and passes through the chosen breakpoint.
* **Segment 2:** (9.0, 2.76) to (19.0, 19.0). This segment connects the breakpoint to the goal set, ensuring it avoids obstacles by carefully selecting waypoints.

**5. Final Path:**

The final path can be represented as an array of waypoints:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, 2.76), 
    (19.0, 19.0) 
]
```

**Important Notes:**

* **Distance from Obstacles:** Ensure your waypoints maintain a safe distance from the obstacle edges to avoid collisions.
* **Linear Connection:** The path segments will be connected linearly to form the final trajectory.
* **Obstacle Verification:** Always double-check that the path does not intersect any obstacles after constructing it.

By carefully selecting the waypoints and ensuring adherence to the path requirements, you can successfully plan a path from the start set to the goal set while avoiding the obstacles and passing through one of the provided breakpoints.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/28/2024 03:30:19 PM] The provided path intersects with both obstacles. Let's analyze the situation and adjust the path to avoid them.

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Identify the problem:** The second segment of the path, from (9.0, 2.76) to (19.0, 19.0), crosses both obstacles.
2. **Examine the valid subpath:** The first segment, from (1.0, 1.0) to (9.0, 2.76), is valid and ends at a breakpoint.
3. **Analyze obstacle positions:** Obstacle 1 is positioned near the start of the second segment, while Obstacle 2 is closer to the end. This suggests we need to find a route around both obstacles.
4. **Consider alternative routes:** Since the path intersects the obstacles, we need to find alternative paths that bypass them.  We can try going around them on the right or left side. 
5. **Adjust the path:** We can try moving the second waypoint from (9.0, 2.76) to a new position that avoids the obstacles.
6. **Maintain constraints:** Ensure the new path still starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and passes through a breakpoint in each set.

**Obstacle Avoidance:**

* **Adjusting the second waypoint:** We can try moving the second waypoint to a new position that avoids the obstacles.  Since we need to pass through a breakpoint in the first set, we can try moving it slightly to the right:
    * **Potential new waypoint:** (9.5, 2.76) or (10.0, 2.76)
* **Consider a new segment:** Since the current segment intersects both obstacles, we might need to add more waypoints to avoid them completely.  We could add a waypoint to go around Obstacle 1 and then another to bypass Obstacle 2.

**New Path:**

Based on the analysis, we can propose a new path that avoids the obstacles and satisfies the constraints:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), # start in the start set
    (9.0, 2.76), # pass through the first breakpoint
    (14.5, 3.76), # new waypoint to go around Obstacle 1
    (18.0, 18.5), # new waypoint to bypass Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0), # end in the goal set
]
```

This new path ensures that:

* **Starts in the start set:** (1.0, 1.0)
* **Ends in the goal set:** (19.0, 19.0)
* **Passes through a breakpoint in the first set:** (9.0, 2.76)
* **Avoids both obstacles:** By adding waypoints to go around the obstacles, we ensure the path does not intersect them.

This is just one possible solution, and other solutions may exist. It is crucial to carefully analyze the environment and the relationships between the obstacles and the waypoints to find the most efficient and safe path.

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

]

[08/28/2024 03:30:27 PM] The provided path intersects with Obstacle 2, which is problematic. Let's analyze the spatial relationships and adjust the path accordingly. 

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Start and End:**  The path correctly starts within the start set and ends inside the goal set.
2. **Breakpoint:** The path correctly passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 2.76).
3. **Obstacle Intersection:** The issue lies with the segment between (14.5, 3.76) and (18.0, 18.5), which intersects Obstacle 2. 
4. **Valid Subpath:** The longest valid subpath from the start is [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 2.76), (14.5, 3.76)].
5. **Obstacle Avoidance:** We need to find a way to navigate around Obstacle 2. 

**Path Adjustments:**

1. **Alternative Route:** Instead of trying to go directly to the goal set, we can take a detour around Obstacle 2 by introducing a new waypoint.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start
    (9.0, 2.76), # Breakpoint 1
    (14.5, 3.76), # Valid segment 
    (15.0, 15.0), # Detour around Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End in goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

* The path now starts at (1.0, 1.0), goes through the breakpoint (9.0, 2.76), and continues to (14.5, 3.76). 
* From there, we introduce a new waypoint (15.0, 15.0) that is positioned above Obstacle 2, allowing us to bypass it.
* Finally, the path reaches the goal set at (19.0, 19.0).

This new path maintains the start and end constraints, utilizes the breakpoint, and successfully avoids intersecting with any obstacles. The detour around Obstacle 2 ensures a valid and safe path.
