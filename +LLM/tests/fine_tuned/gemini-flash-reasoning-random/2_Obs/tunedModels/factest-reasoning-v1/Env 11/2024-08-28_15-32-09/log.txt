# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[13.9, 17.7], [10.7, 17.7], [11.7, 15.1], [13.8, 15.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[16.2, 18.7], [15.9, 13.1], [16.2, 12.1], [17.4, 15.4]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 10.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/28/2024 03:32:16 PM] Here's a possible path that meets the requirements, along with an explanation:

**Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start quadrilateral
    (8.32, 2.54), # Move towards the first breakpoint
    (9.0, 10.0),  # Pass through the first breakpoint
    (17.52, 13.01),  # Move towards the goal, avoiding obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End within the goal quadrilateral
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Start:** We begin at `(1.0, 1.0)`, which is clearly within the start quadrilateral `[[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]`.

2. **Breakpoint 1:** The path goes through the only provided breakpoint, `(9.0, 10.0)`, which is within the constraints of the start and goal sets.

3. **Obstacle Avoidance:**  The chosen path carefully navigates around the obstacles. 
    * The first segment `(1.0, 1.0)` to `(8.32, 2.54)` moves clear of the obstacles. 
    * The second segment from the breakpoint `(9.0, 10.0)` to `(17.52, 13.01)` stays well away from the obstacle clusters.

4. **Goal:** The path ends at `(19.0, 19.0)`, which is definitely within the goal quadrilateral `[[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]`.

**Key Insights:**

* This solution demonstrates an understanding of the spatial constraints within the problem. 
* By analyzing the positions of the start, goal, breakpoints, and obstacles, we can find a path that satisfies all the given conditions.
* The chosen waypoints are not restricted to being parallel to the axes, which allows for more flexibility in path planning.

**Important Note:** While this is a valid path, there may be other solutions that also meet the requirements. The key is to find a path that adheres to all constraints while being as efficient as possible.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/28/2024 03:32:23 PM] The provided path intersects with Obstacle 2, specifically the segment between points (9.0, 10.0) and (17.52, 13.01). We need to adjust the path to avoid this obstacle.

### Analysis
1. **Valid Subpath:** The path is valid up to the point (9.0, 10.0), which is the breakpoint we need to pass through.
2. **Obstacle Avoidance:** We need to find a way to reach the goal set while avoiding Obstacle 2.

### Path Adjustments
1. **New Segment:** Instead of continuing directly to (17.52, 13.01), we can navigate around Obstacle 2 by adding a new waypoint. 
2. **New Waypoint:** To avoid the obstacle, we can add a waypoint at (15.0, 15.0), which is outside the obstacle's boundaries.
3. **Continuing to Goal:** From the new waypoint (15.0, 15.0), we can continue towards the goal set.

### New Path
```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (8.32, 2.54), 
    (9.0, 10.0), 
    (15.0, 15.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0), 
    (20.0, 20.0), # End in the goal set
    (18.0, 20.0),
    (18.0, 18.0),
    (20.0, 18.0)
]
```

This adjusted path starts within the start set, ends in the goal set, passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 10.0), and avoids any obstacles. The path takes advantage of the space available between the obstacle and the boundary of the goal set.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/28/2024 03:32:30 PM] The provided path is incorrect as it crosses Obstacle 2. We need to adjust the path to avoid this obstacle. 

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Valid Subpath:** The initial segment of the path from (1.0, 1.0) to (15.0, 15.0) is valid as it does not intersect any obstacles.
2. **Obstacle Avoidance:** The problem lies in the segment between (15.0, 15.0) and (19.0, 19.0), which intersects Obstacle 2. We need to find an alternative route around this obstacle.
3. **Spatial Relationships:**  Analyzing the environment, we notice that there's a gap between Obstacle 2 and the goal region. We can exploit this gap to reach the goal.
4. **New Path Segment:** We can introduce a new segment by adding a waypoint that circumvents Obstacle 2. Instead of directly moving from (15.0, 15.0) to (19.0, 19.0), we can go around Obstacle 2 by introducing a waypoint near the gap.

**Path Adjustments:**

Instead of directly going from (15.0, 15.0) to (19.0, 19.0), we will adjust the path to go around Obstacle 2:

* **New Path Segment:** After (15.0, 15.0), we can introduce a waypoint like (18.0, 17.0) that goes around the obstacle. This waypoint should be strategically placed to avoid intersecting the obstacle.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (8.32, 2.54), 
    (9.0, 10.0), 
    (15.0, 15.0), 
    (18.0, 17.0), # New waypoint to bypass Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0), 
    (20.0, 20.0), 
    (18.0, 20.0), 
    (18.0, 18.0), 
    (20.0, 18.0) 
]
```

**Explanation:**

This new path maintains the start and end points within the designated regions, passes through the breakpoint, and avoids intersecting any obstacles by strategically adding a waypoint to circumvent Obstacle 2. The added waypoint allows the path to go around the obstacle, ensuring a valid path is found.

    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/28/2024 03:32:38 PM] The provided path has a valid start and end point but it intersects with obstacle 2. To correct this, we need to adjust the path to avoid this obstacle. 

**Analysis:**

1. **Valid Subpath:** The longest valid subpath is `[(1.0, 1.0), (8.32, 2.54), (9.0, 10.0), (15.0, 15.0)]` because it doesn't cross any obstacles.
2. **Problem Area:** The segment between `(15.0, 15.0)` and `(18.0, 17.0)` intersects with obstacle 2.
3. **Obstacle Geometry:** Obstacle 2 is positioned such that a straight line from `(15.0, 15.0)` to the goal area would inevitably cross it. We need to find a detour.

**Path Adjustments:**

1. **Detour Around Obstacle 2:** To avoid obstacle 2, we need to move the path around it.  We can achieve this by adding a waypoint that passes below obstacle 2.
2. **New Waypoint:** Introduce a new waypoint below obstacle 2, for example, `(17.0, 13.0)`.
3. **Final Segment:** From `(17.0, 13.0)`, we can then proceed directly towards the goal area.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), # Start
    (8.32, 2.54), 
    (9.0, 10.0), 
    (15.0, 15.0), # Valid subpath ends
    (17.0, 13.0), # New waypoint to detour around obstacle 2
    (19.0, 17.0), # Proceed towards goal
    (20.0, 20.0), # End in the goal area
    (18.0, 20.0),
    (18.0, 18.0),
    (20.0, 18.0)
]
```

**Explanation:**

The new path starts from the original valid segment and then uses the new waypoint `(17.0, 13.0)` to bypass obstacle 2 before proceeding directly towards the goal area. This path adheres to all the provided constraints: it starts within the start set, ends within the goal set, avoids all obstacles, and passes through the required breakpoint.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/28/2024 03:32:45 PM] The provided path intersects with Obstacle 2, which means we need to adjust the path to avoid it. We can analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and the path to find a solution.

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Valid Subpath:** The path is valid until the segment between (15.0, 15.0) and (17.0, 13.0), which intersects Obstacle 2.
2. **Obstacle Avoidance:** We can avoid Obstacle 2 by moving the path slightly to the right. We can add a waypoint to the path to achieve this.
3. **Breakpoint Consideration:**  The path already passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 10.0), so we don't need to adjust that part.

**Path Adjustments:**

We can adjust the path as follows:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (8.32, 2.54), 
    (9.0, 10.0), 
    (15.0, 15.0), 
    (16.5, 17.0), # New waypoint to move around Obstacle 2
    (17.0, 19.0), # Adjust y-coordinate to avoid intersection with Obstacle 2 
    (19.0, 19.0), # Move towards the goal set
    (20.0, 20.0), # End within the goal set
    (18.0, 20.0), 
    (18.0, 18.0), 
    (20.0, 18.0) 
]
```

This adjusted path ensures that it:

- Starts within the start set.
- Ends within the goal set.
- Passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 10.0).
- Avoids intersecting with any obstacles.

[08/28/2024 03:32:52 PM] The provided path intersects with Obstacle 2, making it invalid. We need to adjust the path to avoid this obstacle. 

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Identify the problem:** The path segment between (15.0, 15.0) and (16.5, 17.0) crosses Obstacle 2.
2. **Analyze the environment:** We need to find a way to move around Obstacle 2 while still passing through the breakpoint (9.0, 10.0). 
3. **Plan the adjustments:** We can adjust the path by:
    - Continuing the valid subpath [(1.0, 1.0), (8.32, 2.54), (9.0, 10.0), (15.0, 15.0)].
    - Adding waypoints to navigate around Obstacle 2.
    - Reaching the goal set.

**Path Adjustments:**

- We can move upwards from (15.0, 15.0) to avoid Obstacle 2.
- Then, we can move rightwards and downwards to reach the goal set.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
