# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[7.7, 13.5], [0.2, 3.8], [11.7, 3.4], [14.6, 10.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.2, 20.0], [5.8, 15.8], [10.1, 17.5], [4.1, 19.6]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 0.75), (9.0, 14.95), (9.0, 19.94)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/28/2024 03:35:17 PM] Here's a possible solution for finding a path that satisfies the given constraints:

**Analysis:**

* **Start:** We can start at any point within the start quadrilateral, e.g., (1.0, 1.0).
* **Goal:** The goal is to reach any point within the goal quadrilateral, e.g., (19.0, 19.0).
* **Obstacles:** 
    * Obstacle 1 is positioned diagonally across the environment, creating a bottleneck.
    * Obstacle 2 is located near the top right corner, partially blocking the goal region.
* **Breakpoints:** We need to include one breakpoint from the set [(9.0, 0.75), (9.0, 14.95), (9.0, 19.94)].

**Path Planning:**

1. **Start:** Begin at (1.0, 1.0) within the start quadrilateral.
2. **Avoid Obstacle 1:** To circumvent Obstacle 1, we can initially move upwards. A waypoint at (4.0, 10.0) will guide the path clear of the obstacle.
3. **Breakpoint:**  From (4.0, 10.0), we can include the breakpoint (9.0, 14.95). This ensures we pass through the breakpoint set. 
4. **Navigate around Obstacle 2:**  With the breakpoint included, we can now maneuver around Obstacle 2.  A waypoint at (16.0, 20.0) will guide the path above Obstacle 2 and towards the goal.
5. **Goal:** Finally, we can reach the goal by moving horizontally to (19.0, 19.0).

**Proposed Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start
    (4.0, 10.0), # Avoid Obstacle 1
    (9.0, 14.95), # Breakpoint 
    (16.0, 20.0), # Navigate around Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0) # Goal 
]
```

**Verification:**

* The path starts within the start quadrilateral and ends within the goal quadrilateral.
* The path does not intersect any obstacles.  We maintain a safe distance to avoid touching.
* The path passes through one of the breakpoints [(9.0, 14.95)].

This path solution effectively navigates the environment while adhering to all the given constraints.

Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/28/2024 03:35:25 PM] ## Thought Process and Path Adjustments:

The provided path correctly starts in the start set, but fails to reach the goal set and intersects with obstacle 1. 

1. **Start Set:** The path begins at (1.0, 1.0) which is within the start set quadrilateral. This is correct.
2. **End Set:** The path ends at (9.0, 14.95) which is outside of the goal set.  This is incorrect.
3. **Segment Intersection:** The segment between (1.0, 1.0) and (4.0, 10.0) intersects with obstacle 1.

### Analyzing Spatial Relationships:

* The goal set is in the upper right quadrant, while the start set is in the lower left.
* Obstacle 1 is located in the middle of the environment, near the first breakpoint.
* Obstacle 2 is located in the upper left quadrant, partially obstructing the direct path to the goal set.

### New Path Proposal:

Given these constraints, we can adjust the path to avoid obstacles and reach the goal set. Here is a proposed path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start in the start set
    (4.0, 7.0),     # Move upward, avoiding obstacle 1
    (10.0, 10.0),   # Move diagonally towards the breakpoint
    (9.0, 14.95),   # Pass through the first breakpoint
    (18.0, 19.0),   # Move towards the goal set, avoiding obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End in the goal set
]
```

### Explanation of Adjustments:

1. **Avoidance:** The path now avoids the problematic segment between (1.0, 1.0) and (4.0, 10.0) by moving slightly above it to (4.0, 7.0).
2. **Reaching the Goal Set:** From (10.0, 10.0), the path reaches the first breakpoint at (9.0, 14.95) and then continues to the goal set while avoiding obstacle 2.
3. **Goal Completion:** The final waypoint (19.0, 19.0) is within the goal set quadrilateral.

By adding waypoints strategically, we have constructed a path that starts within the start set, passes through the first breakpoint, avoids all obstacles, and ends within the goal set.

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

]

[08/28/2024 03:35:32 PM] The provided path intersects with Obstacle 1, specifically the segment connecting (1.0, 1.0) and (4.0, 7.0). We need to adjust the path to avoid this obstacle.

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Analyze the spatial relationships:** The path needs to reach the breakpoint (9.0, 14.95) and then navigate towards the goal set. Obstacle 1 is a major obstacle in this path.

2. **Identify valid segments:** The initial segment from (1.0, 1.0) is valid. We need to find a way to navigate around Obstacle 1.

3. **Obstacle avoidance:** 
    - We can add a waypoint to steer clear of Obstacle 1.  
    - We could move upwards, around the top of Obstacle 1, then downwards towards the breakpoint.

4. **Breakpoints:** The path must pass through the breakpoint (9.0, 14.95). This will dictate the subsequent movements.

**Path Adjustments:**

1. **Adjust the second segment:**  Instead of going directly to (4.0, 7.0), we will steer clear of Obstacle 1 by adding a waypoint to move upwards:
    - Add a waypoint around (4.0, 12.0) to bypass Obstacle 1.

2. **Continue to the breakpoint:** From (4.0, 12.0), we can continue towards the breakpoint (9.0, 14.95).

3. **Navigate towards the goal:** After passing through the breakpoint, we can continue towards the goal set.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # start
    (4.0, 12.0),  # detour around Obstacle 1
    (9.0, 14.95), # breakpoint
    (18.0, 19.0), # goal 
    (19.0, 19.0)  # end within goal set
]
```

This adjusted path satisfies all requirements:

- **Starts within the start set:** (1.0, 1.0) is within the start set.
- **Ends within the goal set:** (19.0, 19.0) is within the goal set.
- **Avoids obstacles:** The path does not intersect with any obstacles.
- **Passes through a breakpoint:** The path passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 14.95).

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/28/2024 03:35:40 PM] The provided path has a problem because the first segment intersects with Obstacle 1. We need to adjust the path to avoid this obstacle.

**Analysis of the Environment:**

* **Start Set:**  We have a starting point within the quadrilateral defined by vertices [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]].
* **Goal Set:** We need to reach a point within the quadrilateral [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]].
* **Obstacles:** We have two obstacles defined by their vertices:
    * Obstacle 1: [[7.7, 13.5], [0.2, 3.8], [11.7, 3.4], [14.6, 10.0]]
    * Obstacle 2: [[0.2, 20.0], [5.8, 15.8], [10.1, 17.5], [4.1, 19.6]]
* **Breakpoints:** We have a set of breakpoints [[9.0, 0.75], [9.0, 14.95], [9.0, 19.94]].

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Start Segment is Invalid:** The initial segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (4.0, 12.0) intersects with Obstacle 1. Therefore, the entire path is invalid.

2. **Adjusting the Path:** We need to adjust the path to avoid Obstacle 1. We can consider the following:
    * **Move Up and Over:**  We can move the path upwards to avoid Obstacle 1 and then move rightwards. This involves adding a new waypoint to the path.
    * **Use Breakpoints:** We can use one of the breakpoints to steer the path away from the obstacles.

3. **New Path with Breakpoints:** We can create a path that uses a breakpoint to steer around Obstacle 1.

**Proposed New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), # start in the start set
    (1.5, 18.0), # move up to avoid Obstacle 1
    (9.0, 19.94), # use a breakpoint to steer clear of obstacles
    (18.0, 19.0), # move rightwards towards the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0) # end in the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

* This path starts within the start set.
* It avoids all obstacles by moving the path upwards to a safe distance and then using a breakpoint to steer clear of the obstacles.
* It passes through one of the breakpoints.
* It ends within the goal set.

## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.

]

[08/28/2024 03:35:47 PM] The provided path intersects with Obstacle 1. We need to adjust the path to avoid this obstacle.

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Analyze the Environment:** The start and goal sets are well-separated, and Obstacle 1 presents the most significant challenge. We need to find a way to navigate around it.
2. **Consider the Breakpoints:** We are required to pass through one of the breakpoints of each set. The breakpoint (9.0, 19.94) is the closest to the goal set and is not obstructed. 
3. **Adjust the Path:** We can use the valid subpath from the start, adjust it to avoid Obstacle 1, and then head towards the breakpoint (9.0, 19.94). From there, we can easily navigate to the goal set.

**Path Adjustments:**

* We can extend the first segment of the path vertically, avoiding Obstacle 1, and then move towards the breakpoint.
* Once we reach the breakpoint, we can move horizontally towards the goal set.

**New Path:**

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),             # Start point
    (1.0, 15.0),            # Move vertically to avoid Obstacle 1
    (9.0, 19.94),           # Pass through breakpoint
    (19.0, 19.0)           # End point in the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

This adjusted path starts within the start set, avoids all obstacles, passes through the required breakpoint, and ends within the goal set. The key adjustment is moving vertically to avoid Obstacle 1 before navigating towards the breakpoint.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/28/2024 03:35:54 PM] The provided path intersects with Obstacle 1, rendering the segment between (1.0, 1.0) and (1.0, 15.0) invalid. We need to adjust the path to avoid the obstacle while still adhering to the given requirements.

Here's the thought process for correcting the path:

1. **Analyzing the Spatial Relationships:** We need to find a way to move the path around Obstacle 1.  We see that the bottom right corner of Obstacle 1 is at (14.6, 10.0). This suggests we can move the path above Obstacle 1 by adjusting the second waypoint.

2. **Adjusting the Path:** We can maintain the initial waypoint (1.0, 1.0) and move the second waypoint to a position above the obstacle. A potential new waypoint could be (1.0, 16.0).

3. **Validating the New Segment:** The new segment between (1.0, 1.0) and (1.0, 16.0) now avoids Obstacle 1. We can continue the path using the breakpoint (9.0, 19.94) and then proceed to the goal set at (19.0, 19.0).

Here is the new path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),       # Start in the start set
    (1.0, 16.0),      # Move above Obstacle 1
    (9.0, 19.94),     # Pass through the breakpoint
    (19.0, 19.0)      # End in the goal set
]
```

This new path starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, avoids all obstacles, passes through one of the breakpoints, and is composed of linear segments that do not intersect any obstacles.
