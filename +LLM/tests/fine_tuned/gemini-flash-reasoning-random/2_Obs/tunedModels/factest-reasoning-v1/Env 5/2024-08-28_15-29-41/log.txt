# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[0.1, 16.4], [9.5, 16.3], [9.5, 17.7], [9.3, 19.9]]
			Obstacle 2: [[11.3, 16.4], [11.0, 12.7], [18.4, 12.3], [19.8, 14.1]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 7.15), (9.0, 20.89)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/28/2024 03:29:48 PM] Here's a breakdown of how to find a path that meets the given requirements:

**1. Analyze the Environment**

* **Start & Goal:** You have quadrilaterals defining the start and goal regions.  
* **Obstacles:** Two obstacles are defined as quadrilaterals, blocking direct paths.
* **Breakpoints:**  A set of breakpoints is provided, which must be included in the path.

**2. Visualize the Problem**

It's helpful to sketch the environment to understand the spatial relationships:

* **Start:**  Draw the quadrilateral with vertices [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]].
* **Goal:** Draw the quadrilateral with vertices [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]].
* **Obstacles:** Draw the quadrilaterals representing the obstacles.
* **Breakpoints:** Plot the breakpoints: (9.0, 7.15) and (9.0, 20.89).

**3. Plan the Path**

We need to find a path that:

* Starts within the start quadrilateral.
* Ends within the goal quadrilateral.
* Passes through one of the breakpoints.
* Avoids intersecting with the obstacles.

**Possible Path**

One possible path could be:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start within the start quadrilateral
    (9.0, 7.15),    # Pass through the first breakpoint
    (10.0, 15.0),    # Navigate around the obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)     # End within the goal quadrilateral
]
```

**Explanation**

1. **Start:**  The path begins at (1.0, 1.0), which lies within the start quadrilateral.
2. **First Breakpoint:** The path proceeds to (9.0, 7.15), satisfying the requirement to pass through one of the breakpoints.
3. **Obstacle Circumnavigation:** The path then navigates around the obstacles by choosing a waypoint (10.0, 15.0). This waypoint is carefully selected to avoid colliding with either obstacle. 
4. **Goal:** Finally, the path reaches (19.0, 19.0), a point within the goal quadrilateral, successfully completing the path.

**Important Notes**

* The exact path will depend on the specific constraints of the problem.
* Ensure that the segments connecting the waypoints do not cross any obstacles. 
* Consider additional spatial constraints and any other restrictions provided in the problem. 
* You can adjust the waypoints slightly to ensure clearance from the obstacles.

]

[08/28/2024 03:29:55 PM] The provided path intersects with Obstacle 2. To correct this, we need to find a way around the obstacle.  Here's a breakdown of the thought process:

1. **Analyze the valid subpath:** The path segment `[(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 7.15), (10.0, 15.0)]` is valid as it does not intersect any obstacles.

2. **Identify the problematic area:** The segment `[(10.0, 15.0), (19.0, 19.0)]` intersects with Obstacle 2. 

3. **Find a detour:** We need to find a way to move from `(10.0, 15.0)` to the goal set while avoiding Obstacle 2.

4. **Consider the breakpoints:** Since we need to pass through a breakpoint, `(9.0, 20.89)` seems like a viable option. 

5. **New path construction:** We can modify the path to include this breakpoint and avoid the obstacle:

    ```
    new_path = [
        (1.0, 1.0), 
        (9.0, 7.15), 
        (10.0, 15.0),
        (9.0, 20.89), 
        (19.0, 19.0) 
    ]
    ```

This new path maintains the required conditions:

* **Start and End:** It starts within the start set and ends within the goal set.
* **Obstacles:** It avoids intersecting with any obstacles.
* **Breakpoints:** It passes through both breakpoints `(9.0, 7.15)` and `(9.0, 20.89)`.

The segment `[(10.0, 15.0), (9.0, 20.89)]` now takes a detour to go around Obstacle 2, and the path continues to the goal set. This solution ensures we meet all the requirements while avoiding obstacles and using breakpoints effectively.

]

[08/28/2024 03:30:03 PM] Here's the breakdown of why the original path is incorrect and how to adjust it to meet the requirements:

**Current Path:**
```python
path = [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 7.15), (10.0, 15.0), (9.0, 20.89), (19.0, 19.0), (9.0, 7.15), (9.0, 20.89), (10.0, 15.0), (9.0, 20.89)]
```

**Issues:**

1. **End Set:** The path does not end within the goal set [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]].
2. **Obstacle Collision:** Segment 3 from (10.0, 15.0) to (9.0, 20.89) intersects with Obstacle 1.

**Proposed Adjustments:**

1. **Navigate around Obstacle 1:** Instead of trying to go over Obstacle 1, we can navigate around it by adjusting the path as follows:
    - Introduce a new waypoint (10.0, 19.9) near the edge of the obstacle. This waypoint ensures a safe distance from the obstacle.
    - Connect the new waypoint (10.0, 19.9) to the goal set by adding an additional point that lies within the goal set.
    - Adjust the path to ensure it doesn't intersect with Obstacle 2 as well.

2. **Ensure End Within Goal Set:** The final waypoint should lie within the goal set [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]].

**New Path:**

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), # Start within start set
    (9.0, 7.15), # Pass through Breakpoint
    (10.0, 15.0), # Move towards the gap between obstacles
    (10.0, 19.9), # Move around Obstacle 1
    (19.5, 19.5) # End within the goal set
]
```

**Analysis:**

- This new path maintains a safe distance from Obstacle 1.
- The path starts within the start set and ends within the goal set.
- The path passes through the provided breakpoint.

**Remember to:**

- Analyze the provided data carefully, including obstacle positions, start and goal sets, and breakpoints.
- Ensure the path adheres to the given requirements.
- Experiment with different paths and waypoints to find the best solution.
