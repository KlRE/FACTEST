# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.6, 18.8], [6.3, 17.5], [13.9, 16.8], [19.0, 16.6]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 7.62), (9.0, 19.94)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/28/2024 03:24:38 PM] Here's a breakdown of how to plan a path that meets the requirements:

**1. Analyze the Environment:**

* **Start Set:** This is a simple square with vertices at (2.0, 2.0), (-0.0, 2.0), (-0.0, -0.0), and (2.0, -0.0).
* **Goal Set:**  Also a square, with vertices at (20.0, 20.0), (18.0, 20.0), (18.0, 18.0), and (20.0, 18.0).
* **Obstacle 1:**  This is a quadrilateral with vertices at (15.6, 18.8), (6.3, 17.5), (13.9, 16.8), and (19.0, 16.6). This obstacle is positioned in a way that it blocks the direct path from start to goal. 
* **Breakpoints:** We have two breakpoints: (9.0, 7.62) and (9.0, 19.94). The first breakpoint is relatively close to the start set, while the second is much closer to the goal set.

**2. Path Planning:**

* **Start Point:** I'll choose the point (1.0, 1.0) within the start set.
* **First Waypoint:** I'll use the breakpoint (9.0, 7.62) as the first waypoint. This forces the path to navigate around the obstacle.
* **Second Waypoint:** To avoid the obstacle and reach the goal set, I'll choose a waypoint that lies above the obstacle, for instance (10.0, 21.0).
* **End Point:**  I'll use the point (19.0, 19.0) within the goal set. 

**3.  Final Path:**

The final path can be represented as:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point
    (9.0, 7.62),   # First breakpoint
    (10.0, 21.0),  # Waypoint above obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point 
]
```

**Explanation:**

* This path starts within the start set, passes through the first breakpoint, avoids the obstacle by moving above it, and then reaches the goal set. 
* The path is constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly, ensuring that the segments do not cross the obstacle.
* The chosen waypoints fulfill all the requirements, including passing through the required breakpoints and staying clear of the obstacle.

]

[08/28/2024 03:24:45 PM] The provided path intersects with Obstacle 1. We need to adjust the path to avoid this obstacle. 

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Analyze the Valid Subpath:** The first segment of the path from (1.0, 1.0) to (9.0, 7.62) is valid as it doesn't intersect with any obstacles.

2. **Identify the Problem Point:** The second segment from (9.0, 7.62) to (10.0, 21.0) intersects with Obstacle 1.

3. **Adjust the Path:**  We can avoid the obstacle by adding a waypoint to the path. 

4. **New Path:** 
    - Start the path at (1.0, 1.0).
    - Move to the first breakpoint at (9.0, 7.62).
    - To avoid the obstacle, we can move to a point that is below and to the right of Obstacle 1, for example (16.0, 16.5).
    - Finally, move to the goal set at (19.0, 19.0).

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # start in the start set
    (9.0, 7.62),    # first breakpoint
    (16.0, 16.5),   # added waypoint to avoid the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)    # end in the goal set
]
```

This new path will start in the start set, end in the goal set, avoid the obstacles, and pass through the first breakpoint.

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/28/2024 03:24:52 PM] The provided path intersects with Obstacle 1, making it invalid. We need to adjust the path to avoid this obstacle.

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Analyze the problem:** We need to find a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, passes through a breakpoint from each set, and avoids all obstacles.
2. **Identify the problematic segment:** The third segment between (16.0, 16.5) and (19.0, 19.0) intersects with Obstacle 1.
3. **Find alternative routes:** We need to find a way to get from (16.0, 16.5) to the goal set without crossing Obstacle 1.
4. **Explore the environment:** The provided obstacle has a concave shape that allows for a path to be routed around its lower left corner.
5. **Adjust the path:** Instead of going directly to (19.0, 19.0), we can adjust the path to go around the lower left corner of the obstacle.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start in the start set
    (9.0, 7.62),     # Pass through the first breakpoint
    (16.0, 16.5),    # End of the valid subpath
    (15.0, 15.0),    # Move away from the obstacle
    (14.0, 14.0),    # Continue moving around the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)     # End in the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

* We keep the initial valid subpath: (1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 7.62), (16.0, 16.5).
* We add two waypoints: (15.0, 15.0) and (14.0, 14.0). These waypoints navigate around the lower left corner of Obstacle 1, ensuring no intersection.
* Finally, we reach the goal set at (19.0, 19.0).

This new path successfully navigates the environment, adhering to all requirements: starting and ending in the correct sets, passing through a breakpoint from each set, and avoiding all obstacles.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/28/2024 03:25:00 PM] ## Thought Process:

The feedback indicates that the current path intersects Obstacle 1, specifically with the segment between (14.0, 14.0) and (19.0, 19.0).  We need to adjust the path to avoid this obstacle. 

1. **Analyze the environment:**  The obstacle is positioned in a way that it blocks a direct path from (14.0, 14.0) to the goal set. 
2. **Find alternative routes:** We need to find a way to circumvent Obstacle 1.  Since the valid subpath ends at (14.0, 14.0), we need to adjust the path from this point. 
3. **Consider breakpoints:** We need to incorporate one of the breakpoints [(9.0, 7.62), (9.0, 19.94)] into the path. The breakpoint (9.0, 7.62) seems more strategically positioned to avoid the obstacle.

## Path Adjustments:

The adjusted path will take a detour to go around Obstacle 1 by using the breakpoint:

1. **Continue from the valid subpath:** (1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 7.62), (16.0, 16.5), (15.0, 15.0), (14.0, 14.0) 
2. **Utilize the breakpoint:** (14.0, 14.0), (9.0, 7.62)
3. **Adjust for Obstacle 1:** (9.0, 7.62), (12.0, 16.8), (18.0, 18.5) # Adjust the path to go around Obstacle 1. 
4. **End in the goal set:** (18.0, 18.5), (19.0, 19.0)

## New Path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), # start in the start set
    (9.0, 7.62), # pass through the first breakpoint
    (16.0, 16.5), # continue towards the goal set
    (15.0, 15.0), # adjust to avoid the obstacle
    (14.0, 14.0), # continue around the obstacle
    (9.0, 7.62), # move back towards the breakpoint
    (12.0, 16.8), # adjust the path to avoid the obstacle
    (18.0, 18.5), # move towards the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0) # end in the goal set

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.

]

[08/28/2024 03:25:07 PM] The provided path intersects with Obstacle 1, and we need to adjust it to avoid this collision while adhering to the given constraints. Here's how we can fix it:

**1. Analysis of the Environment:**

- **Valid Subpath:** The path segments from the start up to the intersection with Obstacle 1 are valid. This includes waypoints (1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 7.62), (16.0, 16.5), (15.0, 15.0), (14.0, 14.0), (9.0, 7.62), and (12.0, 16.8).
- **Problematic Segment:** The segment connecting (12.0, 16.8) and (18.0, 18.5) intersects with Obstacle 1.
- **Spatial Relationships:**  Obstacle 1 is positioned in a way that blocks a direct path from the valid subpath to the goal area. We need to find a detour.

**2. Path Adjustment:**

To avoid the obstacle, we can consider adding waypoints to navigate around it. Here's a potential solution:

**New Path:**

- **Continue from the Valid Subpath:**  We will start with the last valid waypoint: (12.0, 16.8)
- **Detour around Obstacle 1:** To bypass the obstacle, we need to move to the left and then upwards.  We can add a waypoint at (9.0, 19.0) to achieve this. This takes us above the obstacle.
- **Proceed towards the Goal:** Now that we are above the obstacle, we can move towards the goal area.  We can add a waypoint at (18.0, 19.0) to reach the goal area. 

**Final Path:**
```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # start in the start set
    (9.0, 7.62), 
    (16.0, 16.5), 
    (15.0, 15.0), 
    (14.0, 14.0), 
    (9.0, 7.62), 
    (12.0, 16.8), 
    (9.0, 19.0), # added waypoint to bypass the obstacle
    (18.0, 19.0), # proceed towards the goal area
    (19.0, 19.0)  # end in the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

This path starts in the correct starting area, passes through the required breakpoint, and ends in the goal area. By adding a waypoint at (9.0, 19.0), we create a detour around Obstacle 1, ensuring the path does not intersect any obstacles. The path then proceeds towards the goal area, ultimately terminating within the goal area.

[08/28/2024 03:25:15 PM] The provided path has a segment that intersects with Obstacle 1. We need to adjust the path to avoid this obstacle while still adhering to the start and end requirements and passing through the breakpoints.

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Analyzing the Valid Subpath:** The longest valid subpath starts from (1.0, 1.0) and ends at (12.0, 16.8). This subpath correctly starts in the start set and passes through the first breakpoint (9.0, 7.62).

2. **Addressing the Intersection:** The problematic segment is between (12.0, 16.8) and (9.0, 19.0). This segment intersects with Obstacle 1. To avoid this intersection, we need to find an alternative path that moves around the obstacle.

3. **Creating an Alternate Path:** Since we already have a valid subpath ending at (12.0, 16.8), we can continue by adding waypoints that bypass Obstacle 1:
    * From (12.0, 16.8), we can move downwards to (12.0, 15.0). This point is clear of the obstacle.
    * From (12.0, 15.0), we can move horizontally rightwards to (16.0, 15.0), further away from the obstacle.
    * Finally, from (16.0, 15.0), we can move upwards to reach the goal set.

4. **Final Path:**
    * Start from the valid subpath endpoint: (12.0, 16.8)
    * Move downwards: (12.0, 15.0)
    * Move rightwards: (16.0, 15.0)
    * Move upwards to the goal set: (19.0, 19.0)

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start in the start set
    (9.0, 7.62), # Pass through the first breakpoint
    (16.0, 16.5), 
    (15.0, 15.0), 
    (14.0, 14.0), 
    (9.0, 7.62), 
    (12.0, 16.8), # End of the valid subpath
    (12.0, 15.0), # Move downwards
    (16.0, 15.0), # Move rightwards
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Reach the goal set
]
