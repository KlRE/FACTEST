# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.5, 7.9], [8.3, 1.4], [10.9, 8.2], [6.8, 13.7]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 0.62), (9.0, 16.37)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/28/2024 03:23:47 PM] Here's a possible path solution for the given problem:

### Path Planning Analysis

1. **Start and Goal**: We need to find a path that starts within the quadrilateral defined by [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]] and ends within [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]].

2. **Obstacles**: The only obstacle is defined by [[4.5, 7.9], [8.3, 1.4], [10.9, 8.2], [6.8, 13.7]]. This obstacle poses a significant challenge since it lies within the overall space between the start and goal quadrilaterals.

3. **Breakpoints**: We need to ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints from the set [(9.0, 0.62), (9.0, 16.37)].

### Path Construction

We can construct a path that satisfies the given requirements by carefully navigating around the obstacle:

1. **Start**:  Begin the path at a point within the start quadrilateral, for example, (1.0, 1.0).

2. **First Breakpoint**: The path should pass through the breakpoint (9.0, 16.37). This is achievable by moving upwards and to the right from the start point, carefully avoiding the obstacle.  A possible waypoint could be (6.0, 5.0) to create a smooth transition.

3. **Obstacle Circumvention**: From the breakpoint (9.0, 16.37), we can move around the obstacle by continuing upwards to a point above the obstacle. For example, (12.0, 20.0).

4. **Goal**: From the point above the obstacle, it's straightforward to move horizontally towards the goal set and end within the goal quadrilateral.

### Proposed Path

The final path can be represented as:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), # Start point
    (6.0, 5.0), # Moving upwards to avoid obstacle
    (9.0, 16.37), # First breakpoint
    (12.0, 20.0), # Moving above the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0) # Goal point
]
```

This path starts and ends within the specified quadrilaterals, avoids the obstacle, and passes through the required breakpoint. By carefully choosing waypoints, we can ensure that the linear segments connecting the waypoints do not cross any obstacles.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate

]

[08/28/2024 03:23:54 PM] The provided path has a segment that intersects with Obstacle 1.  Here's how we can adjust it:

**Analysis:**

1. **Start & End:** The path correctly starts within the start set and ends within the goal set.
2. **Breakpoint:** It also passes through the provided breakpoint (9.0, 16.37).
3. **Obstacle Intersection:**  The segment between (6.0, 5.0) and (9.0, 16.37) intersects with Obstacle 1. This segment needs adjustment. 

**Spatial Relationships:**

- The breakpoint is located on the upper left corner of Obstacle 1. 
- There is space to the left of the obstacle that we can utilize.

**Path Adjustments:**

To avoid the obstacle, we can add a waypoint to the left of Obstacle 1 before proceeding towards the breakpoint.  This will create a new segment that goes around the obstacle.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), # Start 
    (6.0, 5.0), # Valid segment
    (2.0, 12.0), # New waypoint to avoid obstacle
    (9.0, 16.37), # Breakpoint
    (12.0, 20.0), # Move towards goal
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End within goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. The new waypoint (2.0, 12.0) is added to the path. This point is to the left of the obstacle, ensuring the segment avoids intersection. 
2. The rest of the path remains the same, as it already follows the breakpoint and reaches the goal set.

This adjusted path starts and ends in the correct sets, passes through the breakpoint, and avoids all obstacles by creating a new segment that circumvents Obstacle 1.
