# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[19.7, 15.4], [15.8, 13.4], [16.5, 10.8], [19.3, 9.8]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 10.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/28/2024 03:20:20 PM] Here's a possible path planning solution, keeping in mind the constraints and spatial relationships within the environment:

**Analysis**

1. **Start Point:**  The path must begin within the start set quadrilateral defined by points [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]].
2. **Goal Point:**  The path must end within the goal set quadrilateral defined by points [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]].
3. **Obstacle 1:** The obstacle is located around the point [[19.7, 15.4], [15.8, 13.4], [16.5, 10.8], [19.3, 9.8]] and must be avoided.
4. **Breakpoints:** The path must pass through the breakpoint (9.0, 10.0).

**Path Planning**

1. **Start:** Choose a point within the start quadrilateral, for example, (1.0, 1.0). 
2. **Maneuver to Breakpoint:**  To reach the breakpoint (9.0, 10.0), we can move diagonally upwards and rightwards, passing through the start quadrilateral and ensuring we stay clear of the obstacle.
3. **Bypass Obstacle 1:** From the breakpoint (9.0, 10.0),  we need to bypass the obstacle located around (19.7, 15.4).  
    * We can move to (13.0, 12.0), a point that's on the left-hand side of the obstacle.
    * This position allows us to maneuver around the obstacle by moving to (17.0, 17.0).
4. **Goal Point:** Finally, from (17.0, 17.0), we can move diagonally upwards and rightwards to any point within the goal quadrilateral. For example, (19.0, 19.0).

**Path Array:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 10.0), # Pass through the breakpoint
    (13.0, 12.0), # Maneuver around the obstacle
    (17.0, 17.0), # Continue around the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0) # End within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

* This path successfully navigates from the start set to the goal set, adhering to all requirements:
    * It starts and ends within the designated quadrilaterals.
    * It passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 10.0).
    * It avoids any intersection with the obstacle by carefully planning waypoints that circumvent it.
    * The path uses waypoints that are not necessarily parallel to the axes, allowing for a more flexible route.

**Note:** This is just one possible solution. Other paths might also be valid, depending on the specific requirements and preferences for path smoothness and efficiency.
