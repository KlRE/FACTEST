# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[10.6, 17.4], [0.6, 19.3], [1.5, 17.5], [7.1, 15.9]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 7.36), (9.0, 19.85)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/28/2024 03:21:20 PM] Here's a breakdown of how to plan a path for the given problem:

**1. Understanding the Constraints:**

* **Start Set:** We need to begin our path within the quadrilateral defined by [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]].
* **Goal Set:** We need to end our path within the quadrilateral defined by [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]].
* **Obstacles:**  We must avoid the quadrilateral defined by [[10.6, 17.4], [0.6, 19.3], [1.5, 17.5], [7.1, 15.9]].
* **Breakpoints:** The path should pass through at least one point from each breakpoint set: [(9.0, 7.36), (9.0, 19.85)].

**2. Planning the Path:**

* **Start:** Begin at a point within the start set, for example, (1.0, 1.0).
* **First Breakpoint:** Move to (9.0, 7.36). This requires moving slightly rightwards and upwards while avoiding the obstacle.
* **Avoiding Obstacle:**  Since the obstacle extends slightly above the first breakpoint, it's necessary to move slightly further right before continuing upwards.
* **Second Breakpoint:** From the point reached after avoiding the obstacle, move directly to (9.0, 19.85).
* **Goal:** Finally, navigate downwards and to the right to reach any point within the goal set. A possible endpoint could be (19.0, 19.0).

**3. Proposed Path:**

A possible path could be:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start set
    (1.5, 5.0),  # Move upwards while slightly right to avoid the obstacle
    (9.0, 7.36), # Pass through the first breakpoint
    (10.0, 10.0),# Continue upwards and rightwards
    (9.0, 19.85), # Pass through the second breakpoint
    (19.0, 19.0) # End within the goal set
]
```

**Important Note:** 

This is just one possible path. It's essential to visualize the environment and ensure that the path does not cross any obstacles. It might be necessary to adjust waypoints to fine-tune the path and ensure it fully meets all requirements.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/28/2024 03:21:28 PM] The provided path has a valid start and end but intersects with Obstacle 1. We need to adjust the path to avoid this intersection.

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Identify the problematic segment:**  The segment between (10.0, 10.0) and (9.0, 19.85) intersects Obstacle 1.
2. **Analyze the spatial relationships:** The valid subpath ends near a breakpoint, and we need to find a way to navigate around the obstacle while maintaining the requirement to pass through a breakpoint.
3. **Explore alternative routes:** We can try to move the path around the obstacle by adding waypoints. 
4. **Adjust the path:** We can extend the path from the last valid point (10.0, 10.0) towards the goal set while ensuring we avoid the obstacle.

**Path Adjustments:**

Since the segment from (10.0, 10.0) to (9.0, 19.85) intersects with Obstacle 1, we need to reroute the path around it. We can do this by adding a waypoint to the path that steers it clear of the obstacle:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (1.5, 5.0),
    (9.0, 7.36),
    (10.0, 10.0),
    (15.0, 10.0), # new waypoint added to steer clear of Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

**Explanation:**

- The new waypoint (15.0, 10.0) allows the path to move horizontally to the right of Obstacle 1, avoiding any intersection.
- From this waypoint, the path can then proceed directly to the goal set.

This adjusted path starts within the start set, ends within the goal set, avoids the obstacle, and still passes through one of the breakpoints. It ensures that all path segments are non-crossing and safe to navigate.
