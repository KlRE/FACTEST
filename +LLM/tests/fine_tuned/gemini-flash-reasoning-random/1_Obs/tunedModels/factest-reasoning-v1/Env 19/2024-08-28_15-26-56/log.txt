# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[17.4, 12.7], [11.2, 13.1], [16.4, 10.6], [19.1, 9.4]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 10.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/28/2024 03:27:04 PM] Here's a breakdown of how to find a path that meets the requirements:

**1. Understand the Environment:**

* **Start Set:** You can begin anywhere within the quadrilateral defined by [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]].
* **Goal Set:**  You must end within the quadrilateral defined by [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]].
* **Obstacle:** The path must avoid the obstacle defined by [[17.4, 12.7], [11.2, 13.1], [16.4, 10.6], [19.1, 9.4]].
* **Breakpoint:** The path must pass through (9.0, 10.0).

**2. Analyze the Path Requirements:**

* **Linear Segments:** The path will be made of straight line segments between the chosen waypoints.
* **Non-Crossing:** The path cannot intersect the obstacle.  A safe distance must be maintained. 

**3. Plan the Path:**

1. **Start Point:** Choose a point within the start set. For simplicity, let's start at (1.0, 1.0).

2. **Breakpoint:** The path must pass through (9.0, 10.0). 

3. **Obstacle Avoidance:** The path must avoid the obstacle at [[17.4, 12.7], [11.2, 13.1], [16.4, 10.6], [19.1, 9.4]]. This means we need to find a path that doesn't intersect this obstacle.  

4. **End Point:** Choose a point within the goal set, for example, (19.0, 19.0).

**Path Construction:**

To avoid the obstacle and ensure the path doesn't cross any obstacles, we can plot the waypoints in a way that navigates around the obstacle:

1. **(1.0, 1.0):** This is our start point within the start set.
2. **(5.0, 5.0):**  This waypoint takes us upwards and to the right, keeping us away from the obstacle.
3. **(9.0, 10.0):** This is the breakpoint we must pass through.
4. **(12.0, 15.0):**  Continuing upward and to the right keeps us clear of the obstacle. 
5. **(19.0, 19.0):** This is our endpoint within the goal set.

**Therefore, the new path would be:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (5.0, 5.0), 
    (9.0, 10.0), 
    (12.0, 15.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This path meets all the given requirements:

* **Start and End:** The path starts and ends within the designated sets.
* **Breakpoints:** It passes through the breakpoint at (9.0, 10.0).
* **Obstacle Avoidance:** The path is carefully routed to avoid intersecting the obstacle, maintaining a safe distance.
* **Waypoints:** The path is represented as an array of waypoints, allowing for non-linear movements between them.
