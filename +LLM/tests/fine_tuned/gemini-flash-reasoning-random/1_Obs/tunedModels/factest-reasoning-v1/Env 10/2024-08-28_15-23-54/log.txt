# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[16.9, 17.6], [10.9, 17.4], [11.6, 16.9], [13.3, 16.6]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 10.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/28/2024 03:24:01 PM] Here's a breakdown of how we can find a path that meets all the requirements:

**1.  Analyzing the Environment**

* **Start Set:** The starting quadrilateral is located at the bottom left of the environment.
* **Goal Set:** The goal quadrilateral is located at the top right of the environment.
* **Obstacle:** A single obstacle is positioned in the upper right corner of the environment, close to the goal set.
* **Breakpoint:** The single breakpoint is situated at (9.0, 10.0), closer to the start set.

**2. Planning the Path**

We need a path that begins within the start set, ends within the goal set, passes through the breakpoint, and avoids the obstacle.

* **Start Point:** Let's choose the center of the start set as our starting point, which would be approximately (1.0, 1.0).
* **Breakpoint:** The path must go through the breakpoint (9.0, 10.0).
* **Goal Point:**  We can choose the center of the goal set as our endpoint, which would be approximately (19.0, 19.0).

**3. Constructing the Path**

* **Segment 1:** From (1.0, 1.0) to (9.0, 10.0), we need a path that avoids the obstacle. We can use a simple straight line for this segment.
* **Segment 2:** From (9.0, 10.0) to (19.0, 19.0), we again need to avoid the obstacle.  Since the obstacle is close to the goal set, we can take a detour around it. 

**4. Final Path**

Based on this analysis, the path could look like this:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start in the start set
    (9.0, 10.0), # Pass through the breakpoint
    (14.0, 15.0), # Detour around the obstacle by adding 5 to x and y coordinates 
    (19.0, 19.0) # End in the goal set
]
```

This path starts within the start set, ends within the goal set, passes through the breakpoint, and avoids the obstacle. It also ensures a safe distance from the obstacle by adding 5 to both x and y coordinates for the detour segment.
