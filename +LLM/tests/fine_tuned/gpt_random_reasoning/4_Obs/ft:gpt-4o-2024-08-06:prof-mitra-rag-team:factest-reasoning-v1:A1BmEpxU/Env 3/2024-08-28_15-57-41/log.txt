# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[0.6, 12.5], [8.2, 8.5], [9.6, 17.3], [1.6, 13.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[13.6, 16.4], [14.7, 11.9], [17.0, 15.6], [15.8, 17.3]]
			Obstacle 3: [[2.3, 7.2], [9.7, 0.9], [12.2, 14.1], [9.7, 14.3]]
			Obstacle 4: [[14.3, 18.0], [10.8, 19.7], [11.4, 15.8], [14.0, 16.5]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, -0.26), (9.0, 19.52)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[08/28/2024 03:57:47 PM] new_path = To create a path that successfully navigates from the start set to the goal set while avoiding obstacles, we'll consider the positions of the breakpoints and the obstacles. Here's a possible solution:

### Proposed Path
```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 19.52),  # Pass through the breakpoint
    (18.0, 19.75), # Move close to the goal while avoiding obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set
]
```

### Explanation
1. **Starting Point:** We begin at (1.0, 1.0) within the start quadrilateral.
2. **Breakpoint:** The path includes the breakpoint (9.0, 19.52), which is necessary.
3. **Obstacle Avoidance:** The path navigates carefully around the obstacles:
   - By moving directly from the start to the breakpoint, we avoid Obstacle 1.
   - From the breakpoint, the path shifts right, maintaining a safe distance from Obstacle 4.
   - The final segment is short and goes straight to the goal, ensuring we don’t touch any obstacles.
4. **Goal:** The path ends well within the goal quadrilateral.

This path satisfies all requirements, including passing through the breakpoint, starting and ending within the designated areas, and avoiding intersections with obstacles.

[08/28/2024 03:57:54 PM] new_path = ### Analysis and Adjustments

1. **Initial Path:**
   - The starting point (1.0, 1.0) is correctly within the start set.
   - The first segment to (9.0, 19.52) aims to pass through the breakpoint, which is good. However, it intersects Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3.

2. **Obstacle Avoidance:**
   - To avoid Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3, we need to find a path that moves around them.
   - Notice that there is space to the right of these obstacles. We can redirect the path to exploit this space.

3. **Proposed Path:**
   - **Start:** (1.0, 1.0) – where the path begins.
   - **Waypoint 1:** (3.0, 2.0) – move slightly up to avoid Obstacle 3.
   - **Waypoint 2:** (9.0, 6.0) – move diagonally upwards towards the breakpoint, avoiding Obstacle 1 and 3.
   - **Breakpoint:** (9.0, 19.52) – pass through the breakpoint.
   - **End:** (19.0, 19.0) – proceed to the goal set.

### New Path

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (3.0, 2.0),
    (9.0, 6.0),
    (9.0, 19.52),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This path starts in the start set, avoids all obstacles, passes through a breakpoint, and ends in the goal set.

[08/28/2024 03:58:03 PM] new_path = To adjust the path to avoid intersecting with obstacles while still meeting the path requirements, let's analyze the existing path and make necessary modifications.

### Current Path and Issues

- **Current Path:** `[(1.0, 1.0), (3.0, 2.0), (9.0, 6.0), (9.0, 19.52), (19.0, 19.0)]`
- **Issue:** The segment between `(3.0, 2.0)` and `(9.0, 6.0)` intersects with Obstacle 3.

### Thought Process and Path Adjustments

1. **Start Point Validity:** The path starts at `(1.0, 1.0)`, which is inside the start set. This is correct.

2. **Goal Point Validity:** The path ends at `(19.0, 19.0)`, which is inside the goal set. This is also correct.

3. **Avoiding Obstacle 3:** We need to either adjust the segment between `(3.0, 2.0)` and `(9.0, 6.0)` or reroute to avoid Obstacle 3.

4. **Utilize Breakpoints:** Since the path must pass through a breakpoint, and the provided breakpoint is `(9.0, 19.52)`, we will ensure this is included in the new path.

5. **Redefining the Path:**
    - Start from `(1.0, 1.0)`.
    - Move to a point that avoids Obstacle 3, possibly by passing above or below it.
    - Aim to reach `(9.0, 19.52)` while avoiding all obstacles.
    - Finally, move to `(19.0, 19.0)` to reach the goal set.

### New Path Proposal

Here is a potential path that avoids the obstacles:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (2.5, 1.0), # Move right, staying clear of Obstacle 3
    (10.0, 1.0), # Move further right, avoiding obstacles
    (10.0, 15.0), # Move upwards towards the breakpoint
    (9.0, 19.52), # Reach the breakpoint
    (19.0, 19.0) # Finally, move to the goal set
]
```

This path ensures:

- It starts within the start set.
- It ends within the goal set.
- It passes through the breakpoint `(9.0, 19.52)`.
- It avoids intersecting any obstacles by staying clear of their boundaries.

[08/28/2024 03:58:09 PM] new_path = The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with obstacle 3. Here's how we can modify it:

**Understanding the issue:**

The current path segment from (2.5, 1.0) to (10.0, 1.0) collides with obstacle 3. Obstacle 3 has a vertex at (9.7, 0.9), which is below this segment. The segment needs to be adjusted to pass above this vertex.

**Proposed Solution:**

1. **Extend the valid segment:**  Keep the initial segment [(1.0, 1.0), (2.5, 1.0)].

2. **Add a waypoint above obstacle 3:** To avoid obstacle 3, add a waypoint slightly above its highest vertex.  Let's add a waypoint at (10.0, 8.0).

3. **Connect to the breakpoint:**  Now, we can connect this new waypoint to the breakpoint (9.0, 19.52).

4. **Finalize the path:**  Finally, connect the breakpoint to a point within the goal set, such as (19.0, 19.0).

**Final Path:**

new_path = [
(1.0, 1.0), 
(2.5, 1.0), 
(10.0, 8.0), 
(9.0, 19.52), 
(19.0, 19.0)
] 

**Explanation:**

* The path now starts in the start set, uses a waypoint to avoid obstacle 3, passes through a breakpoint, and ends in the goal set. 
* By choosing a waypoint above the obstacle 3 vertex at (9.7, 0.9), we ensure that the path stays clear of the obstacle.

## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

[08/28/2024 03:58:15 PM] new_path = The issue arises with the segment connecting (2.5, 1.0) and (10.0, 8.0). This segment intersects with Obstacle 3. To correct this, we need to reroute the path to circumvent this obstacle.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identify the problematic segment:** The segment between (2.5, 1.0) and (10.0, 8.0) crosses Obstacle 3.

2. **Find an alternative route:**  We can avoid Obstacle 3 by routing the path above it. This means we'll need to move towards the breakpoint (9.0, 19.52) earlier.

3. **Modify the path:**
    - Maintain the initial segment:  [(1.0, 1.0), (2.5, 1.0)]
    - Add a waypoint above Obstacle 3, say (5.0, 15.0).
    - Connect to the breakpoint (9.0, 19.52).

4. **Finalize the path:** From the breakpoint, we can directly move towards the goal set.

The modified path would be:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (2.5, 1.0),
    (5.0, 15.0),
    (9.0, 19.52),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This path starts in the start set, avoids all obstacles, passes through the breakpoint, and ends in the goal set.

[08/28/2024 03:58:22 PM] new_path = To adjust the path and avoid the obstacles, let's analyze the feedback and the spatial relationships:

### Current Path Issues
1. **First Segment Issue**: The segment between (2.5, 1.0) and (5.0, 15.0) intersects with Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3.

### Plan
- **Avoid Obstacle 1 and 3**: We need to adjust the path to go around these obstacles.
- **Maintain Breakpoint Compliance**: Ensure the path still goes through at least one of the breakpoints in each set.

### Path Adjustment
1. **Start at a Safe Point**: Begin around the midpoint of the start quadrilateral.
2. **Maneuver Around Obstacles**: Add a waypoint to guide the path around the obstacles.
3. **Use the Breakpoint**: Ensure the path passes through the specified breakpoint.

### New Path
Here is a possible new path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),       # Start in the start set
    (2.5, 1.0),       # Move to avoid the bottom part of Obstacle 3
    (4.5, 3.0),       # Add a waypoint to go above Obstacle 1 and 3
    (9.0, 10.0),      # Move towards the breakpoint
    (9.0, 19.52),     # Pass through the breakpoint
    (19.0, 19.0),     # End in the goal set
]
```

### Explanation
- **(4.5, 3.0)**: This waypoint avoids intersection with Obstacle 1 and 3 by navigating around their top-left areas.
- **(9.0, 10.0)**: Positions the path to align with the breakpoint.

This path should satisfy all requirements, starting in the start set, ending in the goal set, passing through a breakpoint, and avoiding all obstacles.
