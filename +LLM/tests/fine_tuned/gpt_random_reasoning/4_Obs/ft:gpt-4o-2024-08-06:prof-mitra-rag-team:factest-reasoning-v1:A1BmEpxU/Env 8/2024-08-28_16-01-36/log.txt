# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[10.3, 11.2], [15.3, 11.7], [11.7, 14.6], [10.6, 12.6]]
			Obstacle 2: [[19.5, 17.8], [17.1, 17.3], [17.7, 12.0], [18.4, 7.1]]
			Obstacle 3: [[15.0, 16.9], [19.3, 15.5], [19.2, 16.3], [17.9, 17.4]]
			Obstacle 4: [[10.3, 12.2], [6.8, 11.1], [9.4, 1.2], [11.3, 4.1]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 0.36), (9.0, 16.9)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.

## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

[08/28/2024 04:01:41 PM] Here's a possible path that meets the requirements:

## Path Analysis
The provided start and goal sets are quite distant from each other. The obstacles, however, are mainly clustered more towards the goal set. This leaves a significant open area for the path to navigate around the obstacles.

### Selected Path
1. **Start Point:**  We'll start at (1.0, 1.0) within the start quadrilateral.
2. **Use Breakpoint:**  To meet the breakpoint requirement, we'll choose the breakpoint (9.0, 0.36) from Breakpoint Set 1.
3. **Avoid Obstacle Cluster:**  Next, navigate the path above the clustered obstacles.
4. **Goal Point:** Finally, we'll end the path at (19.0, 19.0) within the goal quadrilateral.

### New Path
```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start point
    (9.0, 0.36),     # First breakpoint
    (12.0, 10.0),    # Navigate above obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)     # Goal point
]
```

### Verification
- **Start and End:** The path starts within the start region and ends within the goal region.
- **Breakpoint:** The path passes through one of the breakpoints.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** The selected waypoints ensure a safe distance from all obstacles.

Adjust the path slightly if needed to maintain a comfortable margin from any obstacle edges.

[08/28/2024 04:01:49 PM] new_path = To create a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles, let's analyze the situation and make the necessary adjustments.

### Analysis

1. **Start and End Points:**
   - The path starts at (1.0, 1.0) which is inside the start set. 
   - The path ends at (19.0, 19.0) which is inside the goal set.

2. **Breakpoints:**
   - The path correctly passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 0.36) from Breakpoint Set 1.

3. **Obstacle Intersection:**
   - The segment from (9.0, 0.36) to (12.0, 10.0) intersects with Obstacle 4.

### Adjustments

Since the initial segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (9.0, 0.36) is valid, let's start our adjustments from there.

1. **Avoid Obstacle 4:**
   - We need to find a route that bypasses Obstacle 4 while moving towards the goal.
   - To avoid Obstacle 4, we can try moving further east (along the x-axis) and north (along the y-axis) slightly before moving towards the goal.

2. **New Path Proposal:**

   - Start at (1.0, 1.0).
   - Move to the breakpoint (9.0, 0.36).
   - Move east and north, staying clear of Obstacle 4.
   - Continue towards the goal.

3. **Proposed New Path:**

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),       # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 0.36),      # Pass through the breakpoint
    (10.0, 2.0),      # Move east to avoid Obstacle 4
    (12.0, 12.0),     # Move north-east towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)      # End within the goal set
]
```

This path ensures:

- It starts within the start set.
- It ends within the goal set.
- It passes through the required breakpoint.
- It avoids intersecting any obstacles by moving carefully around Obstacle 4.

[08/28/2024 04:01:59 PM] new_path = To correct the provided path and avoid the obstacles, we'll analyze and adjust the problematic segments. 

### Analysis

1. **Initial Path:**

   - `(1.0, 1.0)`, `(9.0, 0.36)`, `(10.0, 2.0)`, `(12.0, 12.0)`, `(19.0, 19.0)`

2. **Valid Subpath:**

   - The path starts within the start set and passes through the breakpoint `(9.0, 0.36)`. The segment from `(1.0, 1.0)` to `(10.0, 2.0)` is valid. This is the longest valid subpath.

3. **Problematic Segment:**

   - The segment from `(10.0, 2.0)` to `(12.0, 12.0)` intersects with obstacles 1 and 4.

### Steps for Correction

1. **Adjust the Path from Valid Subpath:**

   - Since the segment from `(10.0, 2.0)` to `(12.0, 12.0)` intersects obstacles, we need to adjust by adding waypoints.

2. **Obstacle Avoidance:**

   - **Obstacle 1**: Avoid by adding a waypoint closer to the x-axis.
   - **Obstacle 4**: Avoid by shifting upward and around the left side of the obstacle.

3. **New Path Planning:**

   - Use the valid subpath and add waypoints to go around the obstacles.

### New Path

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start
    (9.0, 0.36),  # Breakpoint
    (10.0, 2.0),  # Continue from valid subpath
    (9.6, 5.0),   # Navigate around Obstacle 4 (upwards to avoid intersection)
    (12.0, 7.0),  # Move around Obstacle 1, staying clear
    (15.0, 15.0), # Progress towards the goal, clear of obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End at the goal
]
```

### Explanation

- **Waypoint `(9.6, 5.0)`:** This point is slightly to the left and above `(10.0, 2.0)`, avoiding the intersection with Obstacle 4. 
- **Waypoint `(12.0, 7.0)`:** This point progresses towards the goal while keeping clear of Obstacle 1.
- **Waypoint `(15.0, 15.0)`:** It allows us to move in a straight line towards the goal without encountering more obstacles.
- **Final Waypoint `(19.0, 19.0)`:** Successfully reaches the goal set.

This new path avoids all obstacles while starting in the start set, ending in the goal set, and passing through the specified breakpoint.

    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]

[08/28/2024 04:02:06 PM] new_path = The provided path intersects with Obstacle 4, making it invalid. To address this, we need to modify the portion of the path that leads to the collision.

Here's a breakdown of the current path and the necessary adjustments:

**1. Valid Subpath:  [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 0.36), (10.0, 2.0)]**
These waypoints are valid as they do not intersect any obstacles.

**2. Problematic Segment: (10.0, 2.0) to (9.6, 5.0)**
This segment intersects Obstacle 4. We need to find a way to avoid this obstacle.

**3. Adjusting the Path:**

We can try to move the path around the obstacle by modifying the waypoints after (10.0, 2.0). A possible adjustment would be:

* **New Waypoint:** (10.5, 2.5) - This waypoint is slightly above and to the right of (10.0, 2.0), avoiding Obstacle 4.
* **Connect to Existing Path:** Connect this new waypoint to the next waypoint (12.0, 7.0) while ensuring no intersection with Obstacle 4. 

**Proposed Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start in the start set
    (9.0, 0.36), # Pass through the breakpoint
    (10.0, 2.0), 
    (10.5, 2.5), # Adjusted waypoint to avoid Obstacle 4
    (12.0, 7.0), 
    (15.0, 15.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End in the goal set
]
```

This new path should avoid all obstacles and satisfy the given requirements.

[08/28/2024 04:02:14 PM] new_path = To address the issue with the provided path, we need to avoid the collision with Obstacle 4. Here’s a breakdown of the thought process and the adjustments needed:

### Analysis

1. **Starting Point & Initial Segment:**
   - The path starts at (1.0, 1.0), which is inside the start set, and the initial segments are valid.

2. **Obstacle 4 Intersection:**
   - The segment between (10.5, 2.5) and (12.0, 7.0) intersects Obstacle 4.
   - We need to reroute this segment to avoid the obstacle.

3. **Valid Subpath:**
   - The valid subpath up to the intersection issue is [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 0.36), (10.0, 2.0), (10.5, 2.5)].

4. **Rerouting Around Obstacle 4:**
   - From (10.5, 2.5), the path should reroute around Obstacle 4 by choosing waypoints that stay clear of its vertices.

5. **Reaching the Goal:**
   - From the rerouted waypoint, continue the path towards the goal set while avoiding other obstacles.

### Adjustments

1. **Add Waypoint to Avoid Obstacle 4:**
   - Choose a waypoint like (10.5, 12.0) which is clear of Obstacle 4.

2. **Finish Path to Goal Set:**
   - From the new waypoint, navigate to a point in the goal set such as (19.0, 19.0), avoiding any other obstacles.

### New Path

Here is the adjusted path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start
    (9.0, 0.36),     # Breakpoint
    (10.0, 2.0), 
    (10.5, 2.5),
    (10.5, 12.0),    # New waypoint to avoid Obstacle 4
    (19.0, 19.0)     # End in the goal set
]
```

This path maintains a safe distance from Obstacle 4 and successfully reaches the goal set. Adjustments ensure all waypoints are valid, and the path does not intersect any obstacles.

**Analysis and Corrections:**

1. **Initial Valid Path:**
   - The path starts at \((1.0, 1.0)\) and goes to \((9.0, 0.36)\), passing through a breakpoint. This avoids all obstacles and is valid.

2. **Segmentation Issues:**
   - The segment from \((10.5, 2.5)\) to \((10.5, 12.0)\) intersects with Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 4.
   - We need to adjust this section to navigate around the obstacles.

3. **Adjusting the Path:**
   - We can continue from the valid subpath \((10.0, 2.0)\). 
   - To avoid Obstacle 1 and 4, we can move horizontally to a point east of both obstacles.
   - Then, move vertically up to the goal set avoiding Obstacle 2 and 3.

4. **New Path Proposal:**

    - Start at \((1.0, 1.0)\).
    - Move to the breakpoint \((9.0, 0.36)\).
    - Proceed to \((10.0, 2.0)\).
    - Move slightly east to \((12.0, 2.0)\) to avoid obstacles.
    - Go vertically up to \((12.0, 18.0)\) avoiding Obstacle 2 and 3.
    - Finally, move to the goal at \((19.0, 19.0)\).

**New Path:**

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 0.36),
    (10.0, 2.0),
    (12.0, 2.0),
    (12.0, 18.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```
