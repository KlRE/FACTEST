# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.3, 13.8], [15.9, 7.8], [17.9, 7.8], [15.5, 16.3]]

			Obstacle 4: [[3.8, 19.2], [4.4, 12.9], [5.3, 15.6], [4.0, 19.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 7.2), (9.0, 19.87)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.

## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

[08/28/2024 04:08:00 PM] new_path = Here's a path solution that meets the specified requirements and successfully navigates through the obstacles:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (3.25, 12.56), 
    (9.0, 19.87), 
    (19.0, 19.0) 
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Start Point:** We begin at (1.0, 1.0), which lies within the start quadrilateral.
2. **Maneuvering to Breakpoint:** The path then makes a strategic move to (3.25, 12.56). This waypoint is carefully chosen to navigate between Obstacles 3 and 4, ensuring a safe passage.
3. **Passing Through Breakpoint:** Next, we reach (9.0, 19.87), which is one of the designated breakpoints. This fulfills the requirement of passing through a breakpoint from the set.
4. **Goal Point:** Finally, the path proceeds to (19.0, 19.0), landing within the goal quadrilateral.

**Key Features:**

* **Obstacle Avoidance:** The selected waypoints establish a path that circumvents all obstacles. For instance, the segment connecting (1.0, 1.0) and (3.25, 12.56) is positioned to navigate safely between Obstacles 3 and 4. Similarly, the final segment from (9.0, 19.87) to (19.0, 19.0) avoids Obstacle 2.

* **Linear Segments:** Each pair of consecutive waypoints defines a straight line segment, ensuring that the path is constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.

This solution successfully addresses the requirements by starting within the start set, ending within the goal set, passing through a designated breakpoint, and maintaining a safe distance from all obstacles.

[08/28/2024 04:08:07 PM] new_path = To adjust the path and address the issues:

### Analysis

1. **Valid Subpath:** 
   - The path starts correctly, and the segment between (1.0, 1.0) and (3.25, 12.56) is valid.

2. **Invalid Segment:**
   - The segment from (3.25, 12.56) to (9.0, 19.87) intersects both Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 4.

3. **Breakpoints:**
   - The path must pass through one of the breakpoints in each set. The current path uses (9.0, 19.87), a valid breakpoint.

### Obstacle Avoidance

To avoid the obstacles, we can adjust the path by bypassing the problematic areas:

1. **Add a Waypoint:** Add an intermediate waypoint between the valid subpath and the breakpoint to avoid the obstacles.

### New Path Proposal

- **Waypoint Adjustment:** Use a detour to go around the obstacles.

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),         # Start
    (3.25, 12.56),      # Valid point
    (6.0, 14.0),        # New waypoint to bypass obstacle
    (9.0, 19.87),       # Breakpoint
    (19.0, 19.0)        # End in the goal set
]
```

### Explanation

- The new waypoint (6.0, 14.0) is chosen to route the path between the obstacles safely. 
- This strategy leverages the open space in the environment to navigate around the obstacles while maintaining a clear path to the breakpoint and continuing to the goal set.

This revised path should now successfully bypass the obstacles while satisfying all task requirements.

Here's the adjusted path:

```python
new_path = [

]
```

**Explanation:** 

1. **Valid Segment:** The initial segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (3.25, 12.56) is valid, so it is retained.

2. **Obstacle Circumvention:** The new waypoint (4.4, 12.8) is strategically placed to navigate around Obstacle 4. This point is slightly to the right and above the last valid point (3.25, 12.56), providing a clearance from the obstacle. 

3. **Maintaining Original Path:** The subsequent points (6.0, 14.0), (9.0, 19.87), and (19.0, 19.0) remain the same, ensuring the path still meets the breakpoint requirements and reaches the goal set. 

This adjusted path successfully avoids all obstacles and fulfills the given path planning requirements.

[08/28/2024 04:08:20 PM] new_path = The issue arises because the fourth segment of the path, which connects the points (6.0, 14.0) and (9.0, 19.87), intersects with Obstacle 3. To resolve this, we need to adjust the path to avoid this intersection while ensuring it still passes through a breakpoint.

Let's analyze the situation and make the necessary adjustments:

1. **Valid Subpath:** The longest valid subpath we have so far is [(1.0, 1.0), (3.25, 12.56), (4.4, 12.8), (6.0, 14.0)]. This means the first three segments are valid and do not intersect with any obstacles. 

2. **Avoiding Obstacle 3:** To avoid Obstacle 3, we need to find a path that goes around it.  Since the breakpoint (9.0, 19.87) is problematic, let's try to use the other breakpoint, (9.0, 7.2), which is located below Obstacle 3.

3. **New Path:** We'll create a path that connects the valid subpath to the goal set via the new breakpoint:

    a. Start at (1.0, 1.0).  
    b. Continue along the valid subpath to (6.0, 14.0).
    c. Add a waypoint at (8.0, 14.0) to move right, maintaining a safe distance from Obstacle 3.
    d. Add a waypoint at (9.0, 7.2) to pass through the new breakpoint. 
    e. Move to the goal set by adding the waypoint (19.0, 19.0).	

Therefore, the new path is:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (3.25, 12.56), 
    (4.4, 12.8), 
    (6.0, 14.0), 
    (8.0, 14.0), 
    (9.0, 7.2), 
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
``` 

This path starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, avoids all obstacles, and passes through a breakpoint of each set.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.

[08/28/2024 04:08:27 PM] new_path = To adjust the path and avoid the obstacle, we need to rethink the segment after the breakpoint at \( (9.0, 7.2) \). The segment from \( (9.0, 7.2) \) to \( (19.0, 19.0) \) intersects with Obstacle 1. Let's adjust our path to navigate around it.

### Analysis and Adjustments

1. **Valid Subpath:** The path is valid until the waypoint \( (9.0, 7.2) \).
2. **Avoiding Obstacle 1:**
   * The segment should navigate around Obstacle 1 by keeping a safe distance.
   * We'll move slightly to the right and then upwards to reach the goal, avoiding the obstacle.

### New Path Proposal

Let's adjust the segment after passing through the breakpoint:

1. **From \( (9.0, 7.2) \), move slightly to the right:**
   * Use a waypoint like \( (12.0, 10.0) \) to avoid the obstacle by moving right.

2. **Move upwards and towards the goal:**
   * Add a waypoint \( (14.0, 15.0) \) to guide the path towards the goal while avoiding collisions.

3. **Reach the goal safely:**
   * Finally, head to \( (19.0, 19.0) \) to end inside the goal set.

### New Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (3.25, 12.56),

    (12.0, 10.0), 
    (14.0, 15.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0) 
]
```

This path should satisfy all constraints: start and end in the correct zones, pass through a breakpoint, and avoid crossing any obstacles.

Here's the thought process and the new path:

1. **Identify the problematic segment:** The segment between (14.0, 15.0) and (19.0, 19.0) intersects with Obstacle 1.

2. **Find a detour:**  We need to find a way to navigate around Obstacle 1. We can do this by adding a waypoint near the top-right corner of Obstacle 1.

3. **Adjust the path:**  We can insert a new waypoint (17.0, 16.5) to the existing path. This waypoint lies near the top-right corner of Obstacle 1, allowing the path to smoothly navigate around it.

4. **Re-evaluate the path:** The new path avoids Obstacle 1 and maintains a smooth trajectory towards the goal set.

The corrected path is:
