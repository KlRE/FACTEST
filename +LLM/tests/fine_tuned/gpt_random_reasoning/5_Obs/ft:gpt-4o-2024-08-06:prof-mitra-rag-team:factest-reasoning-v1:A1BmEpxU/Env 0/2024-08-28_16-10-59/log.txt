# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[13.5, 19.5], [11.6, 17.4], [12.2, 17.0], [14.2, 17.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[15.7, 15.4], [19.8, 10.5], [19.3, 12.9], [17.9, 16.5]]
			Obstacle 3: [[10.7, 18.1], [16.1, 15.8], [19.6, 17.6], [11.7, 19.4]]
			Obstacle 4: [[6.5, 18.1], [8.5, 18.2], [10.3, 18.9], [8.5, 18.6]]
			Obstacle 5: [[11.6, 17.0], [17.6, 11.1], [19.4, 15.1], [15.1, 18.1]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 8.2), (9.0, 20.34)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]

[08/28/2024 04:11:07 PM] new_path = ### Analysis of the Provided Data:
Let's break down the problem and the provided data:

**Start Position (Quadrilateral):** The start area is a square with vertices at (2.0, 2.0), (0.0, 2.0), (0.0, 0.0), and (2.0, 0.0). We can start our path from any point within this square.

**Goal Position (Quadrilateral):** The goal area is a square with vertices at (20.0, 20.0), (18.0, 20.0), (18.0, 18.0), and (20.0, 18.0). The path should end in this area.

**Obstacles (Quadrilaterals):** There are five obstacles, each defined by four vertices.  

**Breakpoints:** We have one set of breakpoints: Set 1 with (9.0, 8.2) and (9.0, 20.34). 

### Constraints to Consider:
1. **Non-Crossing:** The path and its segments must avoid crossing any obstacles.
2. **Start and End:** The path must originate within the start set and terminate within the goal set.
3. **Breakpoints:** The path must pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.

### Path Planning:
Keeping the constraints and information in mind, here's a possible path:

1. **Waypoint 1 (Start):** (1.0, 1.0) - This point lies well within the start square. 
2. **Waypoint 2 (Breakpoint 1):** (9.0, 8.2) - This is one of the breakpoints from Set 1. It ensures we meet the breakpoint requirement.
3. **Waypoint 3:** (15.0, 18.0) - This waypoint avoids all obstacles and leads directly towards the goal set.
4. **Waypoint 4 (End):** (19.0, 19.0) - This point lies well within the goal square, safely completing the path.

### New Path:
The path, defined as a list of waypoints, would be:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 8.2),  # Pass through the chosen breakpoint
    (15.0, 18.0), # Navigate around obstacles towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End within the goal set
]
```

This path takes into consideration the constraints provided and safely navigates from the start to the goal position while avoiding any obstacles.

[08/28/2024 04:11:14 PM] new_path = To adjust the path for obstacle avoidance while ensuring it passes through the breakpoints, let's analyze the valid subpath and the obstacles.

### Current Path and Issues:
- **Valid Subpath:** \[(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 8.2)\]
- **Problematic Segment:** Connecting (9.0, 8.2) to (15.0, 18.0) intersects obstacles 3 and 5.

### Strategy:
1. **Bypass Obstacle 3 and 5:** Since the valid subpath ends at (9.0, 8.2), find a detour that avoids these obstacles. 
2. **Maintain Breakpoints:** Ensure any adjustments still include the breakpoints.

### Adjustments:
- **Redirect Around Obstacles:** Since obstacles 3 and 5 are to the right and above the valid subpath, a path going initially upwards to avoid them might be effective.

### New Path:
1. **Start Point:** Begin at (1.0, 1.0).
2. **First Breakpoint:** Move to (9.0, 8.2) safely.
3. **Avoid Obstacles:** Instead of heading directly towards (15.0, 18.0), move upwards to (9.0, 15.0), which bypasses the problematic obstacles.
4. **Final Segment Adjustment:** From (9.0, 15.0), adjust the path towards the goal set by moving in a more diagonal manner to (12.0, 18.0) and finally to (19.0, 19.0).

### New Path:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 8.2),
    (9.0, 15.0),
    (12.0, 18.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This path maintains the necessary breakpoints and avoids colliding with obstacles by strategically navigating around them.

[08/28/2024 04:11:22 PM] new_path = To correct the path and avoid collision with Obstacle 3, let’s analyze and adjust the path accordingly:

### Analysis:

1. **Current Path**: The path is starting correctly from the start set and ends correctly inside the goal set. However, the segment from (9.0, 15.0) to (12.0, 18.0) intersects Obstacle 3.

2. **Valid Subpath**: The longest valid subpath is [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 8.2), (9.0, 15.0)].

3. **Obstacle Avoidance**: Obstacle 3 sits in the path's way from this point. We need to navigate around it to continue towards the goal.

### Adjustments:

1. **Bypass Obstacle 3**: 
   - From (9.0, 15.0), instead of going towards (12.0, 18.0), we can move slightly to the right and then up to avoid the obstacle.
   - A path like (13.0, 15.0) would skirt the edge of Obstacle 3.

2. **Path to Goal**:
   - After clearing Obstacle 3, the path could then move directly towards the goal since there are no obstacles in direct line of sight.

### New Path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start in the start set
    (9.0, 8.2),      # Pass through breakpoint
    (9.0, 15.0),     # Continue upwards
    (13.0, 15.0),    # Divert around Obstacle 3 
    (19.0, 19.0)     # End inside the goal set
]
```

This path:
- Starts in the start set.
- Ends in the goal set.
- Passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 8.2).
- Avoids all obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data

[08/28/2024 04:11:30 PM] new_path = To adjust the path to avoid obstacles, let's analyze and fix the problematic segment.

### Analysis:

#### Current Path
* **Segment 4**: From (13.0, 15.0) to (19.0, 19.0) intersects with:
  * **Obstacle 3**: ([[10.7, 18.1], [16.1, 15.8], [19.6, 17.6], [11.7, 19.4]])
  * **Obstacle 5**: ([[11.6, 17.0], [17.6, 11.1], [19.4, 15.1], [15.1, 18.1]])

### Plan:

1. **Avoid Intersection**: Redirect the path to go around the obstacles without intersecting them, while keeping some distance.
2. **Utilize Breakpoints**: Ensure the path passes through the provided breakpoints.

### Adjusted Path:

We'll modify segment 4 to detour around obstacles 3 and 5.

#### New Waypoints:

1. **Begin at Previous Valid Point**: (13.0, 15.0)
2. **Detour around the Obstacles**: Add waypoints to go below and around the obstacles.
3. **End at a Goal Point**: Ensure the path still ends in the goal set.

Here's a suggestion for the new path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start
    (9.0, 8.2),   # Breakpoint 1
    (9.0, 15.0),  # Intermediate point
    (13.0, 15.0), # Valid subpath end
    (13.0, 14.0), # Move slightly down to avoid Obstacle 3 and 5
    (17.0, 14.0), # Move right, staying clear of obstacles
    (19.0, 17.0), # Move diagonally towards the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Endpoint in the goal set
]
```

### Explanation:

* **(13.0, 14.0)**: Moving slightly down from (13.0, 15.0) avoids the bottom corner of obstacles.
* **(17.0, 14.0)**: Move rightwards keeping clear from obstacles.
* **(19.0, 17.0)**: Diagonal movement allows entering the goal set without intersection.

This approach ensures the path adheres to all requirements and avoids all obstacles.

[08/28/2024 04:11:41 PM] new_path = To correct the provided path, let's analyze the issues and make the necessary adjustments:

**Current Path Analysis:**

The path is:

1. (1.0, 1.0)
2. (9.0, 8.2)
3. (9.0, 15.0)
4. (13.0, 15.0)
5. (13.0, 14.0)
6. (17.0, 14.0)  (Problematic segment)
7. (19.0, 17.0)
8. (19.0, 19.0)  (End is correct)

The problematic segment is between points (13.0, 14.0) and (17.0, 14.0), as it intersects obstacles 2 and 5.

**Correction Strategy:**

1. **Obstacle Avoidance:** We need to reroute the path to avoid these obstacles. We can do this by moving slightly upwards before the problematic segment.
2. **Valid Subpath:** The subpath up to (13.0, 14.0) is valid.

**Adjusted Path:**

To avoid the intersection with obstacles 2 and 5, let's modify the path:

1. Start from (1.0, 1.0).
2. Move to the breakpoint (9.0, 8.2).
3. Move upwards to (9.0, 15.0).
4. Move to (13.0, 15.0).
5. Adjust the path upwards to (13.0, 16.0) to avoid the obstacles.
6. Continue horizontally to (17.0, 16.0) ensuring no intersection.
7. Move upwards to (19.0, 17.0).
8. Finally, end at (19.0, 19.0) within the goal set.

**New Path:**

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, 8.2), 
    (9.0, 15.0), 
    (13.0, 15.0), 
    (13.0, 16.0),  # Adjusted to avoid obstacle
    (17.0, 16.0),  # Adjusted to avoid obstacle
    (19.0, 17.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0) 
]
```

This adjusted path maintains the correct start and end points, passes through a breakpoint, and avoids intersections with the obstacles.

[08/28/2024 04:11:51 PM] new_path = Let's identify and correct the issue with the given path:

1. **Understanding the problem:** The provided path intersects with Obstacle 5 between the points (13.0, 15.0) and (13.0, 16.0). The longest valid subpath from the start is [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 8.2), (9.0, 15.0), (13.0, 15.0)].

2. **Analyzing the obstacles:** Obstacle 5's vertices are [[11.6, 17.0], [17.6, 11.1], [19.4, 15.1], [15.1, 18.1]]. The path segment from (13.0, 15.0) to (13.0, 16.0) intersects with this obstacle.

3. **Path adjustment strategy:** We need to adjust the path to bypass Obstacle 5. Since the provided path reaches (13.0, 15.0) without issues, we can continue from there. Instead of moving vertically, let's move around Obstacle 5 by adjusting the waypoints. 

4. **Proposed path:**
   - Start from (1.0, 1.0)
   - Pass through the breakpoint (9.0, 8.2)
   - Continue to (9.0, 15.0)
   - From (13.0, 15.0), move to (14.0, 16.0) to avoid Obstacle 5
   - Continue to (17.0, 16.0)
   - Reach the endpoint (19.0, 19.0)

**new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, 8.2), 
    (9.0, 15.0), 
    (13.0, 15.0), 
    (14.0, 16.0), 
    (17.0, 16.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)
]**

**Explanation:**

* I added a new waypoint (14.0, 16.0) to divert the path away from Obstacle 5.
* This new waypoint ensures the path doesn't intersect any obstacles and maintains a safe distance.
* The path still meets the requirements of starting in the start set, passing through the chosen breakpoint, and ending in the goal set.

This adjusted path should successfully navigate around the obstacles while fulfilling all the given requirements.
