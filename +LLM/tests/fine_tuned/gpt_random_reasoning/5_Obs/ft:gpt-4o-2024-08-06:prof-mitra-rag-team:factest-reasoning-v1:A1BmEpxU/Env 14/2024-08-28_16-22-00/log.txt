# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[19.7, 12.3], [16.7, 18.9], [17.3, 5.5], [19.4, 5.2]]
			Obstacle 2: [[5.6, 15.6], [15.9, 15.0], [19.1, 15.8], [8.5, 16.3]]
			Obstacle 3: [[3.4, 17.6], [1.6, 17.2], [3.3, 15.3], [3.9, 15.1]]
			Obstacle 4: [[17.1, 17.3], [17.8, 11.0], [19.7, 13.4], [17.3, 18.6]]
			Obstacle 5: [[13.8, 13.0], [10.7, 7.0], [15.7, 6.6], [16.1, 10.4]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 6.7), (9.0, 19.13)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

[08/28/2024 04:22:06 PM] new_path = Hereâ€™s a possible path that meets the requirements, using the given information:

### Path Selection
1. **Start Point:** Choose a point within the start quadrilateral, such as (1.0, 1.0).
2. **Breakpoint 1:** Select the breakpoint (9.0, 6.7) from Breakpoint Set 1.
3. **Avoid Obstacles:** Plan a path that avoids all the obstacles.
4. **End Point:** Choose a point within the goal quadrilateral, such as (19.0, 19.0).

### Proposed Path
The path could be structured as follows:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start point in the start quadrilateral
    (5.0, 6.0),    # Navigate upwards and rightwards clear of obstacles 
    (9.0, 6.7),    # Pass through the selected breakpoint 
    (13.0, 11.0),  # Continue moving upwards and rightwards, avoiding obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point in the goal quadrilateral 
]
```

### Explanation
* **Waypoint (5.0, 6.0):** This waypoint helps the path navigate upwards and rightwards, maintaining a safe distance from the obstacles.
* **Waypoint (13.0, 11.0):** This waypoint further directs the path clear of any obstacles before entering the goal area. 

This path would ensure that it:

* **Starts and ends** within the designated areas.
* **Passes through a breakpoint**.
* **Avoids all obstacles**, considering the linear segments between waypoints. 

Make sure to visualize this path in the context of the provided environment to confirm it meets all the criteria.

[08/28/2024 04:22:17 PM] new_path = To adjust the path to avoid the obstacles and ensure it passes through the required breakpoints, let's analyze the current path and the issues:

### Current Path
1. **(1.0, 1.0) to (5.0, 6.0)**: This segment is valid and doesn't intersect any obstacles.
2. **(5.0, 6.0) to (9.0, 6.7)**: This segment is also valid.
3. **(9.0, 6.7) to (13.0, 11.0)**: This segment intersects with Obstacle 5.

### Issues and Adjustments
- The segment from (9.0, 6.7) to (13.0, 11.0) crosses Obstacle 5. To avoid it, we can reroute around this obstacle.
- The path must still pass through the breakpoint (9.0, 6.7).

### Revised Path Strategy
1. **Start**: Begin at (1.0, 1.0) within the start set.
2. **First Waypoint**: (5.0, 6.0). 
3. **Breakpoint**: Maintain the breakpoint (9.0, 6.7).
4. **Avoid Obstacle 5**: Move higher to avoid the obstacle and then proceed towards the goal.
5. **End in Goal Set**: End at a point inside the goal set, such as (19.0, 19.0).

### New Path Proposal
Here's a path that avoids the obstacles and satisfies all conditions:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),       # Start point
    (5.0, 6.0),       # First waypoint
    (9.0, 6.7),       # Breakpoint
    (12.0, 13.0),     # Avoid Obstacle 5 by moving slightly above it
    (19.0, 19.0)      # End point within the goal set
]
```

This path starts within the start set, goes through the required breakpoint, avoids Obstacle 5 by moving above it, and ends within the goal set.

[08/28/2024 04:22:24 PM] new_path = Here's how I approached fixing the path, considering the obstacles and the feedback provided:

**1. Identify the Problematic Segment:**  
The feedback pointed out that the segment between (12.0, 13.0) and (19.0, 19.0) intersects with multiple obstacles.

**2. Analyze the Obstacle Configuration:**  
- **Obstacle 1:**  The segment cuts through its top portion. 
- **Obstacle 2:** The segment intersects near the bottom. 
- **Obstacle 4:** The segment meets this obstacle near its bottom tip.

**3. Determine a Safe Detour:**  
I noticed a gap between Obstacle 1 and 2, around the coordinate (15.0, 15.0).  This can be used to guide the path around the obstacles.

**4. Adjust the Path:**  
To bypass the obstacles, I decided to incorporate this detour:

- **Keep the first segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (12.0, 13.0).**

- **Add a detour waypoint:**  To avoid the obstacles, add a waypoint at (15.0, 15.0). This point is carefully chosen to be clear of all obstacles while maintaining a linear connection with the previous and next waypoints.

- **Move towards the goal set:** Finally, connect to a point within the goal set, (19.0, 19.0). 

This results in the following new path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    
    (5.0, 6.0),
    (9.0, 6.7),
    (12.0, 13.0),
    (15.0, 15.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)      
]
```

**Explanation:**

- **(1.0, 1.0) to (12.0, 13.0):** This segment remains unchanged as it does not intersect any obstacles.
- **Detour via (15.0, 15.0):** This waypoint ensures the path bypasses all the conflicting obstacles, utilizing the observed gap.
- **Final Segment to the Goal:** The last waypoint leads safely into the goal set, completing the path.

## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]

[08/28/2024 04:22:34 PM] new_path = To solve this motion planning task and avoid the obstacles, let's adjust the provided path:

### Analysis

1. **Current Path:**
   * The path starts correctly within the start set and passes through one of the breakpoints.
   * It reaches a problematic segment between (15.0, 15.0) and (19.0, 19.0) where it intersects multiple obstacles.

2. **Obstacle Interaction:**
   * The last segment intersects with Obstacle 1, Obstacle 2, and Obstacle 4.

3. **Valid Subpath:**
   *  The valid part of the path up to (15.0, 15.0) ends just before encountering these obstacles.

### Adjusting the Path

1. **Identify a Clear Route:**
   * We need to find a path from the last valid waypoint (15.0, 15.0) to the goal set that avoids obstacles.

2. **Spatial Analysis:**
   * There seems to be a clear region above Obstacle 2 to navigate through.
   * We can create a route that goes around Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 4 by moving upwards.

3. **Path Adjustment:**
   * We could add waypoints to direct the path upwards and around the obstacles, eventually reaching the goal set.

### New Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),        # Start point
    (5.0, 6.0),        # Intermediate point
    (9.0, 6.7),        # Breakpoint
    (12.0, 13.0),      # Intermediate point
    (15.0, 15.0),      # Last valid point
    (15.5, 20.0),      # Upwards to avoid obstacles
    (18.0, 19.5),      # Towards goal within clear region
    (19.0, 19.0)       # End point in the goal set
]
```

### Explanation

* The new waypoint (15.5, 20.0) directs the path upwards, avoiding Obstacle 2 and being above Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 4.
* The waypoint (18.0, 19.5) navigates towards the goal set while staying clear. 
* Finally, the path ends at (19.0, 19.0), within the goal set.

This adjustment should avoid all obstacles while fulfilling the path requirements.

[08/28/2024 04:22:42 PM] new_path = Here's a breakdown of the path planning process and the adjustments made to avoid obstacles, ensuring the path meets all requirements:

### Thought Process:

1. **Identify the Start and Goal Sets:**
   - The path correctly starts within the start set and ends within the goal set.

2. **Obstacle Analysis:**
   - **Obstacle 2** poses a problem as it intersects with the fifth segment of the initial path.
   - Other obstacles are not directly intersecting the initial path up to the longest valid subpath. 

3. **Longest Valid Subpath:**
   - The path is valid up to the point (15.0, 15.0). This suggests a need for a new waypoint to bypass Obstacle 2.

4. **Breakpoint Consideration:**
   - The path successfully passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 6.7).

5. **Path Adjustment Strategy:**
   - From the last valid point (15.0, 15.0), avoid Obstacle 2 by navigating above it.
   - A waypoint around (15.0, 17.0) can help bypass Obstacle 2 without intersecting.
   - Then, proceed towards the goal set ensuring to avoid any subsequent obstacles.

### New Path:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start set
    (5.0, 6.0), 
    (9.0, 6.7),  # Through the required breakpoint
    (12.0, 13.0),
    (15.0, 15.0), # Last valid point before encountering an obstacle
    (15.0, 17.0), # New waypoint to avoid Obstacle 2
    (18.0, 18.5), # Continuing towards the goal while avoiding obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0), # End within the goal set
]
```

### Explanation:

- The path now avoids Obstacle 2 by adding the waypoint (15.0, 17.0). 
- The subsequent waypoints are adjusted to ensure the path remains obstacle-free while heading towards the goal set.
- The path still passes through the necessary breakpoint (9.0, 6.7).

This path addresses the feedback regarding intersection with Obstacle 2 and maintains the integrity of starting within the start set, ending within the goal set, avoiding all obstacles, and passing through the required breakpoint.

The provided path starts in the correct start set and ends in the goal set. However, the segment between (15.0, 15.0) and (15.0, 17.0) intersects with Obstacle 2. This makes the path invalid. We need to adjust the path to avoid this obstacle.

**Identifying a Valid Path:**

1. **Use Breakpoint:** The path already passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 6.7) from Breakpoint Set 1. We can use this as a guiding point.

2. **Longest Valid Subpath:** The longest valid subpath from the start is [(1.0, 1.0), (5.0, 6.0), (9.0, 6.7), (12.0, 13.0), (15.0, 15.0)]. This subpath avoids any obstacles.

3. **Avoid Obstacle 2:** We need to adjust the path to avoid intersecting Obstacle 2. We can do this by adding an additional waypoint to pass above the obstacle and reach the goal set.

**Proposed Adjustments:**

1. Continue from the last valid waypoint (15.0, 15.0).
2. Adjust the path to move above Obstacle 2 by adding a waypoint with a higher y-coordinate, say (15.0, 16.5).
3. Continue the path to reach the goal set by adding another waypoint, say (18.0, 18.5).
4. Finish the path by reaching a point within the goal set, for example, (19.0, 19.0).

**New Path:**

Here is the new path, represented as an array of waypoints:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  
    (5.0, 6.0),  
    (9.0, 6.7),  
    (12.0, 13.0),  
    (15.0, 15.0),
    (15.0, 16.5),  
    (18.0, 18.5),  
    (19.0, 19.0)   
]
```

**Conclusion:**

By adding an additional waypoint to move above Obstacle 2, we can avoid any intersections and ensure the path is valid. This new path maintains the requirements of passing through a breakpoint and ending in the goal set.
