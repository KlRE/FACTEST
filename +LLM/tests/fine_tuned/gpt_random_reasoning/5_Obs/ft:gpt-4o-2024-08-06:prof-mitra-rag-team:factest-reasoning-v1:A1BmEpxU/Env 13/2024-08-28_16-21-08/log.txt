# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[18.6, 17.6], [15.8, 17.7], [16.5, 9.7], [18.4, 5.5]]
			Obstacle 2: [[10.1, 17.4], [11.0, 15.2], [18.0, 16.7], [15.6, 18.5]]

    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]

    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]

[08/28/2024 04:21:14 PM] new_path = Here's a possible path, keeping in mind the given breakpoints and obstacle positions:

**Path Outline:**

1. **Start:** Begin at a point within the start quadrilateral.
2. **First Segment:** Navigate towards a chosen breakpoint from the first set.
3. **Obstacle Avoidance:** Carefully plan the path to weave through the obstacles, maintaining a safe distance.
4. **Second Breakpoint:** Pass through one of the breakpoints from the second set.
5. **Goal:** Finally, navigate to a point within the goal quadrilateral.

**Example Path:**

Assuming we start at the center of the start quadrilateral and aim for the center of the goal area while choosing breakpoints sensibly:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # One possible start point in the start area
    (9.0, 4.28),   # First breakpoint
    (15.0, 8.0),   # Carefully navigate avoiding obstacles
    (18.0, 11.0),  # Continue navigating through obstacle field
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point within the goal area
]
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Movement:** The path begins at a central location within the start quadrilateral.
- **First Breakpoint:** It directly moves to the first chosen breakpoint.
- **Maneuvering through Obstacles:** The next waypoint is strategically placed to avoid the nearby obstacles (Obstacles 1 and 5) and head toward the second breakpoint area.
- **Second Breakpoint:** The path curves to ensure it passes through the chosen second breakpoint, maintaining clearance from Obstacles 2 and 4.
- **Final Movement:** Finally, the path smoothly transitions towards the center of the goal area, ensuring a safe and successful endpoint. 

This path is designed to comply with the given conditions. Adjustments may be necessary depending on further spatial analysis of the obstacles and desired start/end points within their respective areas.

[08/28/2024 04:21:22 PM] new_path = Certainly! Let's analyze the given path and the obstacles to adjust the path accordingly.

### Current Path
- **Start:** (1.0, 1.0)
- **Breakpoint 1:** (9.0, 4.28)
- **Waypoint:** (15.0, 8.0)
- **Waypoint:** (18.0, 11.0)
- **End:** (19.0, 19.0)

### Problematic Segment
- **Segment 3:** Between (15.0, 8.0) and (18.0, 11.0) intersects with Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 5.

### Strategy for Obstacle Avoidance
1. **Identify a detour:** The path needs a detour around the obstacles. We need to adjust the waypoint after the breakpoint to avoid collision.
2. **Utilize Breakpoints:** Since the path already passes through Breakpoint 1, it satisfies the requirement.

### Adjusted Path
1. **Starting the path from within the start set:** (1.0, 1.0)
2. **Passing through Breakpoint 1:** (9.0, 4.28)
3. **Detour around obstacles:** Adjust the next waypoint to avoid obstacles. A possibility is to go further right before going upwards.
4. **Waypoint to avoid Obstacle 1 and 5:** (17.0, 8.0)
5. **Move towards the goal set:** (18.5, 11.5)
6. **End the path within the goal set:** (19.0, 19.0)

### New Path
```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 4.28),
    (17.0, 8.0),
    (18.5, 11.5),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This adjusted path avoids the intersecting obstacles while starting within the start set, ending in the goal set, and passing through the required breakpoint.

[08/28/2024 04:21:27 PM] new_path = The issue arises from the second segment of the path, which connects the first breakpoint (9.0, 4.28) with the third waypoint (17.0, 8.0).  This segment directly crosses through Obstacle 5, rendering it invalid.

To correct this, we need to find an alternative path around Obstacle 5 that still adheres to all the requirements. 

Given that our longest valid subpath ends at the first breakpoint (9.0, 4.28), we could potentially try to navigate around Obstacle 5 by adding additional waypoints.

Since Obstacle 5 is located in the upper region with respect to the current path, one solution could be to add a new waypoint that bends the path upwards and then connect to another waypoint that steers it back towards the goal set, effectively going around Obstacle 5.

Here's one possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # start in the start set
    (9.0, 4.28),   # first breakpoint
    (10.0, 9.0),   # new waypoint to steer upwards
    (19.0, 13.0),  # another waypoint to avoid Obstacle 5 and steer towards the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)   # end in the goal set
]
```

This path will start at a point within the start set, pass through the first breakpoint, avoid Obstacle 5, and finally end in the goal set.

[08/28/2024 04:21:36 PM] new_path = Here's how you might think about correcting the provided path based on the feedback:

**1. Review the Feedback:**

The feedback indicates that the path starts and ends in the correct sets, but segment 3 (between (10.0, 9.0) and (19.0, 13.0)) intersects with Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 4. The longest valid subpath from the start is [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 4.28), (10.0, 9.0)].

**2. Analyze the Obstacles:**

* **Obstacle 1:** The segment intersects the obstacle vertices [[18.6, 17.6], [15.8, 17.7], [16.5, 9.7], [18.4, 5.5]].
* **Obstacle 4:** The segment intersects the obstacle vertices [[11.8, 19.4], [13.9, 10.1], [18.7, 13.5], [14.6, 17.1]].

**3. Find a Valid Path:**

To avoid the obstacles, we need to find a path that goes around them. We can do this by adding waypoints to the path.

* **Avoid Obstacle 1:** We can add a waypoint at (10.0, 12.0) to avoid Obstacle 1. This waypoint is above the obstacle and does not intersect with it.
* **Avoid Obstacle 4:** We can add a waypoint at (14.0, 14.0) to avoid Obstacle 4. This waypoint is to the right of the obstacle and does not intersect with it.

**4. Construct the New Path:**

The new path will be:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), # start in the start set
    (9.0, 4.28), # pass through the first breakpoint
    (10.0, 9.0), # continue along the valid subpath
    (10.0, 12.0), # avoid Obstacle 1
    (14.0, 14.0), # avoid Obstacle 4
    (19.0, 19.0) # end in the goal set
]
```

**5. Conclusion:**

The new path starts and ends in the correct sets, passes through a breakpoint, and avoids all obstacles. It should be a valid solution to the motion planning task.

## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

[08/28/2024 04:21:48 PM] new_path = ### Analysis

1. **Current Path:**
   - The provided path is \([(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 4.28), (10.0, 9.0), (10.0, 12.0), (14.0, 14.0), (19.0, 19.0)]\).

2. **Issue:**
   - Segment 3 between \((10.0, 9.0)\) and \((10.0, 12.0)\) intersects with Obstacle 3: \([[0.8, 11.4], [9.6, 10.5], [10.4, 11.4], [6.1, 11.8]]\).

3. **Valid Subpath:**
   - The longest valid subpath is \([(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 4.28), (10.0, 9.0)]\).

### Strategy for Path Adjustment

1. **Avoid Obstacle 3:**
   - To avoid the intersection, the path should bypass Obstacle 3. This requires adjusting the y-coordinate since the path collides vertically.

2. **Utilize Breakpoints:**
   - The breakpoint \((9.0, 4.28)\) is already utilized in the valid subpath. Consider using the other breakpoint \((9.0, 16.76)\).

3. **Plan New Segments:**
   - After passing the breakpoint \((9.0, 4.28)\), steer the path around Obstacle 3 and towards the goal.

### Adjusted Path

Here's a possible adjusted path: 

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),        # Start in the start set
    (9.0, 4.28),       # Breakpoint 1
    (9.0, 8.5),        # Move vertically to avoid Obstacle 3
    (12.0, 14.0),      # Move upwards, avoiding other obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)       # End in the goal set
]
```

### Explanation

- **Vertical Movement:** The path moves vertically from \((9.0, 4.28)\) to \((9.0, 8.5)\) to stay clear of Obstacle 3.
- **Diagonal Movement:** It then moves diagonally to \((12.0, 14.0)\), carefully navigating around Obstacle 4.
- **Final Segment:** Finally, it reaches the goal set at \((19.0, 19.0)\).

This path ensures all obstacles are bypassed while maintaining the breakpoint requirement and starting and ending within the designated sets.

[08/28/2024 04:21:59 PM] new_path = Sure! Let's analyze the problem and the provided feedback to adjust the path accordingly. 

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Start and End Points:** The provided path correctly starts in the start set and ends in the goal set. This is important, so we'll keep the initial and final waypoints.

2. **Obstacle Analysis:** The feedback indicates that the segment between (12.0, 14.0) and (19.0, 19.0) intersects with Obstacles 1, 2, and 4. We need to adjust this segment to avoid these obstacles.

3. **Valid Subpath:** The feedback indicates that the longest valid subpath is [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 4.28), (9.0, 8.5), (12.0, 14.0)]. This means that the path until (12.0, 14.0) is valid.

4. **Path Adjustments:**

   - We need to find a new path from (12.0, 14.0) to (19.0, 19.0) that avoids the obstacles.
   - One possible approach is to move horizontally to the right to avoid the obstacles and then move diagonally to reach the goal set.
   - We can add a waypoint at (15.0, 14.0) to move horizontally and then another waypoint at (18.0, 17.0) to move diagonally towards the goal set.

**New Path:**

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 4.28),
    (9.0, 8.5),
    (12.0, 14.0),
    (15.0, 14.0),
    (18.0, 17.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This new path maintains the valid initial subpath and makes two adjustments to avoid the obstacles. I moved horizontally to the right with a waypoint at (15.0, 14.0), and then I moved diagonally with a waypoint at (18.0, 17.0) to reach the goal set. This path should now avoid all obstacles and successfully navigate the robot from the start set to the goal set.
   
**Note:** This solution assumes that the obstacles are static, and there are no other dynamic obstacles in the environment.
