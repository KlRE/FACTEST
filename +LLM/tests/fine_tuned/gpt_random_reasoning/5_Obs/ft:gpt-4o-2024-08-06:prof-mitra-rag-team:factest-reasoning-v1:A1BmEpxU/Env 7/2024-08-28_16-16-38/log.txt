# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[20.0, 7.8], [6.6, 15.3], [8.9, 8.8], [10.0, 6.9]]
			Obstacle 2: [[15.5, 5.8], [17.8, 7.7], [19.8, 17.4], [18.9, 17.3]]
			Obstacle 3: [[3.5, 10.6], [11.6, 17.5], [12.0, 19.3], [9.0, 18.1]]
			Obstacle 4: [[14.0, 12.8], [13.1, 7.6], [14.3, 5.8], [16.9, 9.0]]
			Obstacle 5: [[8.4, 19.4], [8.0, 18.6], [9.7, 16.5], [17.2, 16.2]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 3.31), (9.0, 14.61), (9.0, 20.59)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

[08/28/2024 04:16:43 PM] new_path = Here's a possible path solution, keeping in mind the constraints and using a breakpoint:

**Path Analysis:**

1. **Start:** Choose a starting point within the start set, say (1.0, 1.0).
2. **Breakpoint:** Use the breakpoint (9.0, 3.31) from Breakpoint Set 1. 
3. **Goal:** Choose an endpoint within the goal set, say (19.0, 19.0).

**Proposed Path:**

1. (1.0, 1.0) - Start point within the start set
2. (9.0, 3.31) - Breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1
3. (19.0, 19.0) - End point within the goal set

**Obstacle Avoidance:**

Visualize the path and ensure it doesn't intersect the obstacles:

* The first segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (9.0, 3.31) should pass below Obstacle 3 and to the left of Obstacle 1.
* The second segment from (9.0, 3.31) to (19.0, 19.0) should pass above Obstacle 1 and to the left of Obstacles 2, 4, and 5.

**Path Array:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 3.31),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This path adheres to the problem's requirements, passing through a breakpoint, avoiding obstacles, and connecting start to goal regions.

[08/28/2024 04:16:53 PM] new_path = To fix the path and avoid intersecting with obstacles, we need to consider the feedback and identify a new segment that avoids obstacles 1 and 4. Here’s the adjusted path:

### Thought Process

1. **Current Valid Subpath:** The feedback indicates that the subpath [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 3.31)] is valid. This means that the path starts from a point within the start set and passes through one of the breakpoints. 

2. **Segment Crossing Obstacles:** The second segment [(9.0, 3.31), (19.0, 19.0)] crosses obstacles 1 and 4. To fix this, we need to find a path that bypasses these obstacles.

3. **Obstacle Avoidance:** Analyze the spatial arrangement of obstacles 1 and 4. Notice that the path can be rerouted to avoid these obstacles by adding waypoints.

4. **Adjusting the Path:** We can create a new waypoint at a point that avoids both obstacles, then proceed towards the goal set. Let's choose a point that navigates around obstacle 4 and ensures a clear path to the goal.

### New Path

We will adjust the path by adding a waypoint that avoids the obstacles:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 3.31),
    (12.0, 10.0),  # New waypoint to navigate around obstacle 4
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point in the goal set
]
```

- **Explanation:** The new waypoint (12.0, 10.0) is added to create a clear path around obstacle 4. This allows the final segment to reach the goal set without intersecting any obstacles.

This adjusted path maintains the requirements:

- **Starts in the start set:** Yes, it starts at (1.0, 1.0).
- **Ends in the goal set:** Yes, it ends at (19.0, 19.0).
- **Avoids obstacles:** The new segment [(9.0, 3.31), (12.0, 10.0), (19.0, 19.0)] bypasses obstacles 1 and 4.
- **Passes through breakpoints:** It passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 3.31).

[08/28/2024 04:17:02 PM] new_path = Here's my thought process to find a valid path for this motion planning task:

**1. Starting Point:**
   - The path begins at `(1.0, 1.0)`, which is correctly within the start set.

**2. First Breakpoint:**
   - The path utilizes the breakpoint `(9.0, 3.31)` which is valid as it's within Breakpoint Set 1.

**3. Identifying the Problem:**
   - The issue arises with the segment connecting `(9.0, 3.31)` and `(12.0, 10.0)`. This segment intersects with Obstacle 1. 

**4. Analyzing Obstacle 1:**
   - Obstacle 1 has vertices at `[[20.0, 7.8], [6.6, 15.3], [8.9, 8.8], [10.0, 6.9]]`. This means it stretches diagonally across a portion of the plane.

**5. Finding an Alternative Route:**
   - To avoid crossing Obstacle 1, the path can go around it. One possible solution is to move horizontally to the right from `(9.0, 3.31)` until a point beyond the obstacle's rightmost vertex (20.0) is reached, then move vertically upwards towards the goal.

**6. Proposed Path:**
   - Starting from `(1.0, 1.0)`, proceed to `(9.0, 3.31)`.
   - Instead of going to `(12.0, 10.0)`, move horizontally to the right, e.g., to a point like `(22.0, 3.31)`.
   - Then, move vertically upwards to a point within the goal set, such as `(22.0, 19.0)`.
   - Finally, adjust slightly to end within the goal set, e.g., `(19.0, 19.0)`.

**New Path:**

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),         # Start Point
    (9.0, 3.31),        # Breakpoint
    (22.0, 3.31),       # Move right, avoiding Obstacle 1
    (22.0, 19.0),       # Move up towards the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)        # End Point within the goal set
]
```

This path satisfies all the requirements:
   - Starts in the start set.
   - Ends in the goal set.
   - Passes through a breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1.
   - Does not intersect with any obstacles.
