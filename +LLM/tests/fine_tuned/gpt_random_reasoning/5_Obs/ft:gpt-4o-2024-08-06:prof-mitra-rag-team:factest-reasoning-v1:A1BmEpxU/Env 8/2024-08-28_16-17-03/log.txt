# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[13.8, 19.6], [12.0, 16.1], [12.9, 15.9], [16.2, 17.1]]
			Obstacle 2: [[17.0, 16.5], [16.6, 10.9], [17.1, 11.3], [18.5, 16.4]]
			Obstacle 3: [[2.0, 16.1], [10.1, 15.2], [12.2, 19.3], [8.5, 18.8]]
			Obstacle 4: [[8.0, 14.0], [12.3, 13.6], [10.5, 19.6], [8.1, 16.8]]
			Obstacle 5: [[16.0, 14.0], [15.3, 11.2], [17.7, 11.5], [18.3, 12.1]]

		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 5.95), (9.0, 20.43)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.

    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]

[08/28/2024 04:17:08 PM] new_path = Here's a possible path solution, keeping in mind that the path needs to start within the start quadrilateral, ends within the goal quadrilateral, passes through at least one breakpoint from each set, and avoids crossing any obstacles:

**Path Array:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 5.95), # Pass through breakpoint 1
    (15.0, 10.0), # Navigate around obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Start:** Begins at (1.0, 1.0) within the start quadrilateral.
2. **Breakpoint 1:** Passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 5.95).
3. **Obstacle Avoidance:** The waypoint (15.0, 10.0) is chosen to navigate around the cluster of obstacles in the middle of the environment.
4. **End:** Ends at (19.0, 19.0) within the goal quadrilateral.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Distance from Obstacles:** The chosen waypoints provide a safe distance from the obstacles to avoid intersection.
* **Linear Segments:** The path is constructed by connecting these waypoints with straight lines, ensuring no crossings with obstacles along the way.

This path represents just one possible solution. Depending on the exact positions and shapes of the obstacles, there may be other valid paths that meet the given requirements. Adjustments may be necessary based on any specific constraints or challenges presented by the environment.

[08/28/2024 04:17:17 PM] new_path = The path needs to be adjusted to avoid crossing obstacles 2 and 5. 

**Here's a breakdown of the thought process and adjustments made:**

1. **Start and Initial Valid Path:**
   - The path starts at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start set. 
   - It successfully passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 5.95) and continues to (15.0, 10.0) without crossing any obstacles.

2. **Identifying the Problematic Segment:**
   - The segment from (15.0, 10.0) to (19.0, 19.0) intersects with obstacles 2 and 5. 
   - We need to find a way around these obstacles to reach the goal set.

3. **Spatial Analysis:**
   - Obstacle 2: Lies above and to the right of (15.0, 10.0). 
   - Obstacle 5: Lies below and to the right of (15.0, 10.0).

4. **Path Adjustment:**
   - From (15.0, 10.0), instead of going directly to (19.0, 19.0), we can move upwards   and slightly to the left to avoid obstacle 2. This avoids the obstacle while moving closer to the goal set.
   - After clearing obstacle 2, proceed towards the goal set.

**Revised Path:**

1. **Maintain the original path until (15.0, 10.0):**
   - (1.0, 1.0)
   - (9.0, 5.95)
   - (15.0, 10.0)

2. **Avoiding obstacles and reaching the goal set:**
   - (14.5, 12.0): Move upwards and slightly left to avoid obstacle 2.
   - (19.0, 19.0): Finally, move towards the goal set.

**Final Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 5.95),
    (15.0, 10.0),
    (14.5, 12.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This adjusted path starts within the start set, passes through the required breakpoint, avoids all obstacles, and ends within the goal set.

[08/28/2024 04:17:29 PM] new_path = Certainly! Here's the breakdown of how we can adjust the path to avoid collisions with obstacle 2 while ensuring the path remains valid according to the provided criteria:

Current Situation:
- The path starts correctly in the start set and ends correctly in the goal set.
- The path successfully passes through the valid waypoint (9.0, 5.95).
- The segment between (14.5, 12.0) and (19.0, 19.0) intersects with Obstacle 2, making it invalid.

### Analyzing the Environment and Working Out a Solution:

#### **1. Understand the spatial relations of the obstacle and the path:**

**Obstacle 2:**
-  The obstacle is elongated along the y-axis with one side closer to the path than the other.
-  Its top left corner at (17.0, 16.5) and bottom left corner at (16.6, 10.9) are particularly relevant here because they are closest to the path segment.

**Current Segment:**
- It seems to aim directly at the goal from (14.5, 12.0).
- We need to maneuver around Obstacle 2.

#### **2. Path Adjustments:**

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Steer around the top of Obstacle 2:**
    - We could try to create a path that goes above the obstacle and then down to the goal.

2. **Stay within the "valid" channel:**
    - There seems to be enough space to navigate around the bottom and left sides of Obstacle 2, staying within the boundaries of the valid channel.

**Choosing the Best Approach:**

-  After evaluating both options, it seems more efficient and less complex to adjust the path around the bottom half of Obstacle 2. This requires fewer deviations and shorter path lengths.

#### **3. Implement the Solution:**

To solve this, we will add a waypoint to the path at a point that keeps the path clear of Obstacle 2.

- **Adjusted Path:**
  - Instead of going directly to (19.0, 19.0) from (14.5, 12.0), we will add a waypoint closer to the obstacle.
  - Let's choose a waypoint that is further left and lower than the obstacle's closest point (17.0, 16.5).

For instance, we could add a waypoint at **(16.0, 10.0)**. This allows us to avoid the obstacle and not extend the path unnecessarily while keeping inside the valid channel.

### New Path:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, 5.95), 
    (15.0, 10.0), 
    (14.5, 12.0),
    (16.0, 10.0),  # New added point
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

### Conclusion:

By adding a new waypoint at (16.0, 10.0) the path successfully steers clear of Obstacle 2 while ensuring no other obstacles are intersected along the way. This adjustment maintains the integrity of the path while accomplishing the task. The path now meets all requirements:

- **Starts** inside the Start position
- **Ends** inside the Goal position

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.

[08/28/2024 04:17:38 PM] new_path = The provided path encounters issues with obstacles 2 and 5.  To address this, let's carefully analyze the situation and make some adjustments:

**Analysis:**

* The valid subpath we have is `[(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 5.95), (15.0, 10.0), (14.5, 12.0), (16.0, 10.0)]`. This means the first four segments are valid, but the segment between (16.0, 10.0) and (19.0, 19.0) collides with obstacles. 
* Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 5 are causing the problem. They create a ``bottleneck`` around the (16.0, 10.0) point, making it difficult to reach the goal without colliding. 

**Proposed Solution:**

We can try to adjust the path by adding waypoints that steer clear of these obstacles. Here's a potential solution:

1. **Maintain Valid Subpath:** Keep the valid subpath `[(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 5.95), (15.0, 10.0), (14.5, 12.0), (16.0, 10.0)]`.
2. **Avoid Obstacle 5:**  After (16.0, 10.0), let's add a waypoint that avoids colliding with Obstacle 5. We can move slightly downwards and to the right to bypass it.
3. **Re-enter Goal Set:** Finally, we can guide the path towards the goal set while ensuring it doesn't collide with Obstacle 2. 

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 5.95),
    (15.0, 10.0),
    (14.5, 12.0),
    (16.0, 10.0), 
    (17.5, 9.0),   # Added waypoint to avoid Obstacle 5
    (19.0, 19.0)   # Move to goal set while avoiding Obstacle 2
]
```

**Explanation:**

* The added waypoint (17.5, 9.0) steers the path away from Obstacle 5, creating a safer route. 
* The final waypoint (19.0, 19.0) is within the goal set and avoids colliding with any obstacles.

This adjusted path should successfully navigate from the start set to the goal set while avoiding all obstacles.

[08/28/2024 04:17:46 PM] new_path = To adjust the path and avoid the obstacle, we need to carefully analyze the provided data and feedback.

**Feedback Analysis:**

* The path starts correctly in the start set and ends in the goal set.
* The issue lies with the segment between points (17.5, 9.0) and (19.0, 19.0), which intersects with Obstacle 5. 

**Obstacle Avoidance Strategy:**

1. **Continue from the Longest Valid Subpath:**  The valid subpath is [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 5.95), (15.0, 10.0), (14.5, 12.0), (16.0, 10.0), (17.5, 9.0)]. 

2. **Bypass Obstacle 5:**
   * From (17.5, 9.0), we need to carefully navigate around Obstacle 5.
   * Instead of going directly to (19.0, 19.0), introduce a waypoint to the right of the obstacle, perhaps moving slightly higher in the Y direction to avoid crossing the obstacle.

**Revised Path:**

* We’ll add a waypoint at (17.5, 14.0) to bypass Obstacle 5, ensuring we stay clear of its vertices.

**Here’s the new path:**

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 5.95),
    (15.0, 10.0),
    (14.5, 12.0),
    (16.0, 10.0),
    (17.5, 9.0),
    (17.5, 14.0),  # New waypoint to bypass obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End in the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

* This path maintains the valid subpath and adds an additional waypoint to circumvent Obstacle 5.  
* The new segment from (17.5, 9.0) to (17.5, 14.0) avoids intersecting with the obstacle, providing a clear path to the goal set.

**Final Verification:**

* It’s crucial to visually verify this path against the obstacle positions to ensure it doesn’t intersect with any obstacles.

[08/28/2024 04:17:56 PM] new_path = To adjust the provided path and avoid intersection with the obstacles, we'll analyze the segments and adjust accordingly.

### Analysis of the Problem

1. **Valid Initial Segments**: The starting point at (1.0, 1.0) and the initial segments up to (17.5, 9.0) are valid and do not intersect any obstacles.
2. **Problematic Segment**: The segment from (17.5, 9.0) to (17.5, 14.0) intersects obstacles 2 and 5. We need to reroute this segment to avoid these obstacles.
3. **Obstacles to Avoid**: 
   - **Obstacle 2**: [[17.0, 16.5], [16.6, 10.9], [17.1, 11.3], [18.5, 16.4]]
   - **Obstacle 5**: [[16.0, 14.0], [15.3, 11.2], [17.7, 11.5], [18.3, 12.1]]

### Thought Process

1. **Rerouting Around Obstacles**: Since the path intersects obstacles 2 and 5, we need to find a way to go around them.
2. **Utilizing Breakpoints**: We'll ensure the path goes through the breakpoint (9.0, 5.95) as required.
3. **Navigate Towards Goal**: Keep the path clear of obstacles as it approaches the goal set.

### New Path Steps

1. **Start**: Begin at (1.0, 1.0).
2. **Breakpoint**: Go to the breakpoint (9.0, 5.95).
3. **Reroute to Avoid Obstacles**:
   - Move to (15.0, 10.0) to avoid obstacle 5. This position is calculated to be to the left of obstacle 5.
   - Shift slightly upwards to (14.5, 11.0) to avoid obstacle 2.
   - Shift to the right, but above obstacles, to (16.5, 14.0).
4. **Approach Goal**:
   - Move upwards to (18.0, 17.0), avoiding obstacles.
   - End at (19.0, 19.0) in the goal set.

### New Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (9.0, 5.95), 
    (15.0, 10.0), 
    (14.5, 11.0), 
    (16.5, 14.0), 
    (18.0, 17.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This path starts from the start set, goes through the required breakpoint, avoids all obstacles, and ends in the goal set.
