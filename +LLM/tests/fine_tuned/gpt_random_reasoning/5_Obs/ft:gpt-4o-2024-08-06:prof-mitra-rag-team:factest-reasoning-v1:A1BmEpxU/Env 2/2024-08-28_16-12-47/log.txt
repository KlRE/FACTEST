# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

			Obstacle 4: [[7.3, 17.0], [10.5, 10.6], [17.0, 7.3], [10.3, 16.6]]
			Obstacle 5: [[2.6, 10.7], [13.7, 13.3], [14.8, 16.7], [5.9, 13.7]]

    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

[08/28/2024 04:12:52 PM] new_path = Here's a potential path, considering the provided data and constraints:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start set
    (5.0, 19.5), # Navigate above obstacles, using a breakpoint from set 1
    (10.0, 19.5), # Move horizontally while remaining clear of obstacles
    (19.0, 19.5), # Continue horizontally towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting Point:** Chose (1.0, 1.0) as a starting point within the start quadrilateral. 
* **Navigating Above Obstacles:** The path moves upward at the beginning to pass above all obstacles (using the breakpoint (9.0, 19.38)).
* **Horizontal Movement:**  The path then moves horizontally, staying clear of obstacles until reaching the goal area.
* **Ending Point:**  Finally, (19.0, 19.0) is chosen as an ending point within the goal quadrilateral.

**Key Points:**

* **Obstacle Avoidance:** By navigating above the obstacles early on, the path avoids intersecting with any of them.
* **Breakpoint Inclusion:** The path passes through one breakpoint from the provided set.
* **Start and End Compliance:** The path begins within the start quadrilateral and ends within the goal quadrilateral.

[08/28/2024 04:12:58 PM] new_path = The path needs to be adjusted to address the intersection with Obstacles 3 and 5 as well as ensure the path passes through a breakpoint from Set 1.

Here's a breakdown of the thought process and adjustments:

1. **Examine the Current Path:**

   *The path starts at (1.0, 1.0) and immediately moves towards (5.0, 19.5). This segment crosses both Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 5.*

2. **Identify an Alternative Route:**

   *Since the initial trajectory leads to collisions, we need to find an alternative path that safely navigates around the obstacles.*

3. **Utilize Breakpoints:**

   *The breakpoint set offers an opportunity to direct the path through specific points.  We can aim for the breakpoint (9.0, 11.18) which provides a clear path to the goal.*

4. **New Path Design:**

   * Start at (1.0, 1.0).
   * Move horizontally towards (9.0, 1.0) to stay clear of Obstacle 3.
   * Move vertically to the breakpoint (9.0, 11.18).
   * From the breakpoint, move horizontally towards (18.0, 19.38).
   * Finally, move slightly downwards to reach the goal set at (19.0, 19.0).

By incorporating the breakpoint and rerouting to avoid the obstacles, the path becomes:

```
new_path = [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 1.0), (9.0, 11.18), (18.0, 19.38), (19.0, 19.0)]

[08/28/2024 04:13:07 PM] new_path = Here's the breakdown for adjusting the path to avoid the obstacles, specifically Obstacle 3:

**Understanding the Problem:**

1. **Start and End Points:** Our path must originate from within the start set defined by four vertices and terminate within the goal set defined by another set of vertices. 
2. **Obstacle Navigation:** Every segment of the path must steer clear of the obstacles.
3. **Breakpoint Requirement:** The path must pass through at least one breakpoint from the given set.

**Current Path Flaws:**

- The second segment, between (9.0, 1.0) and (9.0, 11.18), crosses Obstacle 3. 

**Strategizing the Solution:**

- We can leverage the valid subpath currently extending from (1.0, 1.0) to (9.0, 1.0).
- To bypass Obstacle 3, we'll need to chart a course around it.

**Spatial Analysis for Obstacle Avoidance:**

1. **Obstacle 3 Geometry:** It overlaps our path; therefore, a detour is necessary.
2. **Open Space Identification:** We notice an open area to the left of Obstacle 3 (lower y-values) that we can utilize to maneuver south of it.

**Revised Path Strategy:**

- **Waypoint Adjustments:** 
   - After reaching (9.0, 1.0), instead of heading directly north, we'll move west and then north to circumvent Obstacle 3.
   - We'll incorporate the breakpoint (9.0, 0.12) to fulfill the path's requirements.

**Proposed New Path:**

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start from a valid point within the start set
    (9.0, 1.0),     # Continue to the first valid point
    (9.0, 0.12),    # Pass through the required breakpoint, staying clear of obstacles
    (5.0, 0.12),    # Move west to give clearance from Obstacle 3
    (5.0, 14.0),    # Move north to bypass the obstacle safely
    (18.0, 14.0),   # Shift east towards the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End the path at a valid point within the goal set
]
```

This new path ensures:

- **Obstacle Avoidance:** The segments now flow around Obstacle 3 without intersection.
- **Breakpoint Inclusion:** It integrates the required breakpoint from the set.
- **Start and End Compliance:** It begins within the start set and concludes within the goal set.

[08/28/2024 04:13:16 PM] new_path = To find a new path that avoids intersecting with any obstacles while satisfying the given conditions, let's carefully analyze the provided data and the current path issues:

### Current Path and Issues
1. **Start Segment**: The path starts at (1.0, 1.0) and successfully reaches the breakpoint (9.0, 0.12) via (9.0, 1.0).
2. **Problematic Segment**: The segment from (5.0, 0.12) to (5.0, 14.0) crosses Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 5.

### Analysis and Path Adjustment
- **From the Valid Subpath**: Since the valid subpath is [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 1.0), (9.0, 0.12), (5.0, 0.12)], we can start from (5.0, 0.12).
- **Avoiding Obstacles**:
  - Move rightwards from (5.0, 0.12) to clear Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 5.
  - Then move upwards towards the goal.

### Adjusted Path
1. **Waypoint 1**: (1.0, 1.0) - Start point
2. **Waypoint 2**: (9.0, 1.0)
3. **Waypoint 3**: (9.0, 0.12) - Breakpoint
4. **Waypoint 4**: (5.0, 0.12) 
5. **Waypoint 5**: (10.0, 0.12) - Move rightwards to clear obstacles
6. **Waypoint 6**: (10.0, 14.0) - Move upwards to approach the goal
7. **Waypoint 7**: (19.0, 19.0) - End point in the goal set

### New Path
```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 0.12),
    (5.0, 0.12),
    (10.0, 0.12),
    (10.0, 14.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This adjusted path should avoid the given obstacles while meeting the start, end, and breakpoint requirements.

[08/28/2024 04:13:25 PM] new_path = ### Analysis

The feedback highlights that the original path intersects with obstacles 3, 4, and 5. Specifically, the segment between points (10.0, 0.12) and (10.0, 14.0) is problematic. To address this, we need to adjust the path to avoid these obstacles.

### Adjusted Path

We'll start by considering the valid subpath and then adjust the subsequent waypoints to navigate around the obstacles.

1. **Continue from the valid subpath:** The path is valid until the waypoint (10.0, 0.12).
2. **Analyze the obstacles:** Obstacles 3, 4, and 5 overlap with the problematic segment.
3. **Avoid obstacles:** We need to create a path that moves around these obstacles, possibly by adding new waypoints.
4. **Reach the goal:** The path needs to reach the goal set at (19.0, 19.0) while avoiding further obstacles.

### New Path Proposal

We'll adjust the path by adding new waypoints to avoid the problematic area and reach the goal.

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start
    (9.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 0.12),
    (5.0, 0.12),
    (10.0, 0.12),
    (10.0, 5.0), # Move upwards, avoiding obstacle 3  
    (12.0, 5.0), # Move rightwards, avoiding obstacle 4
    (12.0, 17.0), # Move upwards, avoiding obstacle 5
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End in the goal set
]
```

### Explanation

This new path makes the following adjustments:

* The path now moves upwards from (10.0, 0.12) to (10.0, 5.0), avoiding the intersection with obstacle 3.
* The path then moves rightwards to (12.0, 5.0), ensuring it clears obstacle 4.
* Finally, the path moves upwards again to (12.0, 17.0), avoiding obstacle 5, before reaching the goal at (19.0, 19.0).

This revised path should satisfy all the requirements, including passing through one of the breakpoints.

[(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 1.0), (9.0, 0.12), (5.0, 0.12), (10.0, 0.12), (10.0, 5.0), (12.0, 5.0), (12.0, 17.0), (19.0, 19.0)]
```

The issue is with the segment between points `(10.0, 0.12)` and `(10.0, 5.0)`, which intersects with Obstacle 3.

**2. Identify the Valid Subpath**

The longest valid subpath from the start is:

```
[(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 1.0), (9.0, 0.12), (5.0, 0.12), (10.0, 0.12)]
```

**3. Adjust the Path**

To avoid Obstacle 3, we need to adjust the path. Here's a possible solution:

- From `(10.0, 0.12)`, move downwards to `(10.0, -1.0)` to avoid Obstacle 3.
- Move rightwards to `(15.0, -1.0)` to pass below the obstacle.
- Then move upwards to `(15.0, 5.0)` to reach the previous point in the path.
- Continue with the remaining points in the original path:

```
[(15.0, 5.0), (12.0, 5.0), (12.0, 17.0), (19.0, 19.0)]
```

**4. Final Adjusted Path**

Combining all the segments, the new path is:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 0.12),
    (5.0, 0.12),
    (10.0, 0.12),
    (10.0, -1.0),
    (15.0, -1.0),
    (15.0, 5.0),
    (12.0, 5.0),
    (12.0, 17.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This path starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, avoids all obstacles, and passes through one of the breakpoints.
