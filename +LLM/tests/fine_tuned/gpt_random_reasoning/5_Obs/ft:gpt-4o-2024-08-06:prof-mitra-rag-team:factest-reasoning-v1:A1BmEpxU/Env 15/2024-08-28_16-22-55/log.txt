# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[16.6, 14.6], [15.0, 9.4], [15.3, 3.0], [16.0, 5.2]]

			Obstacle 4: [[15.2, 19.9], [15.7, 18.0], [17.0, 14.9], [16.3, 18.0]]
			Obstacle 5: [[9.7, 10.7], [1.7, 6.2], [2.7, 1.2], [10.2, 1.8]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, -0.15), (9.0, 14.79), (9.0, 20.25)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

[08/28/2024 04:23:04 PM] new_path = Here's a possible path solution, considering the provided start and goal areas, obstacles, and breakpoints:

**new_path =**

* Start Point: (1.0, 1.0) - Chosen within the start set.
* Breakpoint 1: (9.0, -0.15) - Chosen from the Breakpoint Set 1.
* Midpoint: (15.0, 15.0) -  Carefully chosen to navigate between obstacles 2 and 3.
* End Point: (19.0, 19.0) -  Chosen within the goal set.

**Path Analysis:**

1. **Start to Breakpoint 1:** The path goes vertically down from (1.0, 1.0) to (9.0, -0.15), avoiding obstacles 1, 2, and 5 by staying to the left.

2. **Breakpoint 1 to Midpoint:** The path then moves diagonally upwards towards (15.0, 15.0), successfully avoiding obstacles 2, 3, and 4. 

3. **Midpoint to End Point:** Finally, the path moves directly upwards to the goal point (19.0, 19.0). Obstacles 2, 3, and 4 are successfully avoided by navigating through the open space.

**Explanation:**

The key to this path is the careful selection of the midpoint (15.0, 15.0). This point allows for a smooth transition between the breakpoint and the end point while avoiding all obstacles. 

**Reminder:**

This is just one possible solution. There may be other valid paths that meet the requirements. Always double-check your chosen path visually or using a simulation to ensure it avoids all obstacles and meets the specified conditions.

[08/28/2024 04:23:13 PM] new_path = Here's a possible path solution, keeping in mind the requirements and obstacle layout:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the Start Quadrilateral
    (5.0, 0.0),  # Navigate around Obstacle 5
    (9.0, -0.15), # Pass through the breakpoint (9.0, -0.15)
    (12.0, 17.5), # Move up and pass close to Obstacle 3 (consider clearance)
    (19.0, 18.5)  # End within the Goal Quadrilateral
]
```

### Explanation

1. **Start**: Begins at a point (1.0, 1.0) within the start set.
2. **Avoid Obstacle 5**: The path moves rightwards under Obstacle 5.
3. **Breakpoint 1**: Passes through the breakpoint at (9.0, -0.15).
4. **Navigate Obstacles 2 and 3**: Moves upward to avoid Obstacle 2 and get around Obstacle 3.
5. **Goal**: Ends at (19.0, 18.5), within the goal set.

### Considerations

* **Obstacle Clearance**: Check that all segments maintain a safe distance from obstacle boundaries.
* **Linear Segments**: Ensure each segment does not intersect any obstacle.

This is just one possible solution. There might be other valid paths depending on the specific constraints and goals.

[08/28/2024 04:23:20 PM] new_path = The provided path collides with multiple obstacles, making it necessary to strategize a new path. 

Here's a breakdown of the issue and the proposed solution:

**Identifying the Issue:**

1. **Collision:**  The segment connecting (9.0, -0.15) to (12.0, 17.5) intersects with obstacles 2, 3, and 5.

**Analyzing the Obstacles:**

* **Obstacle 2:** Stretches from a low to mid-range y-coordinate.
* **Obstacle 3:** Situated higher up in the y-axis, covering a broader horizontal span.
* **Obstacle 5:** Presents a complex shape closer to the starting point.

**Path Adjustment Strategy:**

1. **Utilize the Valid Subpath:**  Keep the initial valid segment ending at the breakpoint (9.0, -0.15).
2. **Navigate Around the Obstacles:**  From the breakpoint, move horizontally to a new waypoint that avoids the obstacle field.
3. **Approach the Goal:**  Find a path that ascends towards the goal while steering clear of any obstacles.

**Proposed Path:**
   ```
   new_path = [
       (1.0, 1.0),    # Start
       (5.0, 0.0),    # Move right
       (9.0, -0.15),  # Breakpoint
       (14.0, -0.15), # Move further right to avoid obstacles
       (14.0, 18.0),  # Ascend towards goal avoiding top obstacles
       (19.0, 18.5)   # Arrive at goal
   ]
   ```

**Key Changes:**

* **Horizontal Movement:**  Added a segment to move further right, completely bypassing the clusters of obstacles 2, 3, and 5.
* **Vertical Approach:**  Moved directly upwards after clearing the obstacles to reach the goal safely.

This new path effectively navigates the obstacle field, ensuring no intersections occur, while starting from the designated start set and ending within the goal set.

[08/28/2024 04:23:28 PM] new_path = To solve this motion planning task, let's carefully analyze the provided information and adjust the path to avoid the obstacles.

### Analysis

1. **Start and Goal Positions:**

   - The path correctly starts within the start set at (1.0, 1.0).
   - The path correctly ends within the goal set at (19.0, 18.5).

2. **Breakpoints:**

   - The path passes through a breakpoint at (9.0, -0.15), satisfying the requirement to pass through a breakpoint.

3. **Obstacles:**

   - The feedback indicates the segment between (14.0, -0.15) and (14.0, 18.0) intersects with Obstacle 2. This is the problematic segment.

### Path Correction

To avoid Obstacle 2, we'll adjust the path to go around it.

1. **Avoid Obstacle 2:**
   - After reaching the breakpoint (9.0, -0.15), we'll steer the path to avoid Obstacle 2.

    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start in the start set
    (5.0, 0.0),      # Move to this point
    (9.0, -0.15),    # Pass through the breakpoint
    (12.0, -2.0),    # Move downward to avoid Obstacle 2
    (14.0, -2.0),    # Continue
    (14.0, 18.0),    # Reach a safe spot near the goal set
    (19.0, 18.5)     # End in the goal set
]
```

### Explanation

- The new path maintains the initial successful movements to the breakpoint.
- It introduces a downward movement to avoid Obstacle 2 before reaching the goal area.
- The path then continues upward, reaching the goal set safely without intersecting obstacles.

This adjustment keeps the path within the constraints while avoiding the obstacle.

Remember, this is just one possible solution and other valid paths could exist depending on the specific requirements and context of the task.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

[08/28/2024 04:23:37 PM] new_path = To adjust the path and avoid obstacles, we need to analyze the problematic segment and find a detour that maintains the path's overall trajectory. Here's the process:

### Analysis

1. **Current Path:**
   - The path starts at (1.0, 1.0) and successfully passes through the breakpoint (9.0, -0.15).
   - The issue arises with the segment from (14.0, -2.0) to (14.0, 18.0), which intersects Obstacle 2.

2. **Obstacle Intersection:**
   - Obstacle 2 is a quadrilateral defined by the vertices [[5.8, 11.9], [14.7, 5.7], [14.8, 10.8], [13.0, 13.2]].
   - The vertical segment of the path intersects this obstacle.

3. **Detour Strategy:**
   - Instead of going straight up from (14.0, -2.0) to (14.0, 18.0), we need a detour to avoid Obstacle 2.
   - We can circumvent the obstacle by moving horizontally away from it and then vertically upwards.

### Revised Path

To avoid Obstacle 2 and reach the goal set:

1. **Starting Point:** Begin within the start set, e.g., (1.0, 1.0).
2. **Move Horizontally:** Move horizontally to a breakpoint, e.g., (9.0, -0.15).
3. **Detour Around Obstacle:**
   - Move slightly below the bottom edge of Obstacle 2, e.g., (12.0, -2.0).
   - Continue horizontally to a point clear of the obstacle, e.g., (15.0, -2.0).
4. **Move Vertically:** Move vertically upwards to a point near the goal set boundary, e.g., (15.0, 18.0).
5. **Enter Goal Set:** Proceed to a point within the goal set, e.g., (19.0, 18.5).

### New Path

Here is the new path that avoids the obstacle:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (5.0, 0.0),
    (9.0, -0.15),
    (12.0, -2.0),
    (15.0, -2.0),
    (15.0, 18.0),
    (19.0, 18.5)
]
```

This path maintains connection to the start and goal sets, avoids all obstacles, and passes through the necessary breakpoint.

[08/28/2024 04:23:46 PM] new_path = Sure! Let's walk through the provided information and generate a new path.

**Current Path:**

The current path you've provided is:

```
path = [(1.0, 1.0), (5.0, 0.0), (9.0, -0.15), (12.0, -2.0), (15.0, -2.0), (15.0, 18.0), (19.0, 18.5)]
```

**Feedback:**

1. **Start set:** Correct. The path starts at point (1.0, 1.0), which lies within the start set quadrilateral.
2. **End set:** Correct. The path ends at point (19.0, 18.5), which lies within the goal set quadrilateral.
3. **Obstacle Intersection:** The feedback indicates that the segment connecting (15.0, 18.0) to (19.0, 18.5) intersects Obstacle 4.

**Plan for Correction:**

Since the path intersects Obstacle 4, we need to adjust it to avoid this obstacle. We can achieve this by adding an additional waypoint that detours around the obstacle.

**New Path:**

Let's construct a new path that avoids the obstacle while meeting the requirements:

1. Start from the same point within the start set, (1.0, 1.0).
2. Move to the first breakpoint (9.0, -0.15).
3. Detour around Obstacle 4 by going below it. We can add a waypoint below the obstacle's lowest point, which is at y=14.9.
4. From this waypoint, move to the goal set while ensuring no intersections with other obstacles.

**Final Path:**

The adjusted path that avoids Obstacle 4 and meets all requirements is:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start point within the start set
    (5.0, 0.0),   # Waypoint
    (9.0, -0.15), # Breakpoint
    (12.0, -2.0), # Waypoint
    (15.0, -2.0), # Waypoint
    (15.0, 14.5), # New waypoint below Obstacle 4
    (19.0, 18.5), # End point within the goal set
]
```

This path avoids intersection with Obstacle 4 by taking a detour below its lowest point. Additionally, it starts within the start set, ends within the goal set, and passes through the required breakpoint.

    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/28/2024 04:23:57 PM] new_path = To correct the path and avoid obstacles, let's analyze the problem and plan a new path.

### Analysis

1. **Starting Point and Goal:**
   - We start at (1.0, 1.0), within the start set, which is good.
   - We need to reach a point within the goal set, which is a square.

2. **Longest Valid Subpath:**
   - The longest valid subpath is: \((1.0, 1.0) \rightarrow (5.0, 0.0) \rightarrow (9.0, -0.15) \rightarrow (12.0, -2.0) \rightarrow (15.0, -2.0) \rightarrow (15.0, 14.5)\)
   - This means the path up to (15.0, 14.5) is valid.

3. **Problematic Segment:**
   - The segment from (15.0, 14.5) to (19.0, 18.5) intersects with Obstacle 4.
   - Obstacle 4 is positioned between (15.2, 19.9) and (16.3, 18.0).

4. **Breakpoints:**
   - We must pass through the breakpoint (9.0, -0.15), which is already included in the path.

5. **Other Obstacles:**
   - Obstacles 1, 2, 3, and 5 need to be considered, but they do not intersect with the current valid subpath.

### Plan to Adjust the Path

1. **Avoid Obstacle 4:**
   - Deviate north of (15.0, 14.5) to avoid Obstacle 4.
   - This can be done by moving slightly upwards before heading east towards the goal.

2. **New Path Segment:**
   - From (15.0, 14.5), move to a point north of Obstacle 4, such as (15.0, 19.0).
   - Then, move towards the goal set at (19.0, 18.5).

3. **Verify:**
   - Ensure this new path segment does not intersect with any obstacles and ends in the goal set.

### New Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start
    (5.0, 0.0),
    (9.0, -0.15), # Breakpoint
    (12.0, -2.0),
    (15.0, -2.0),
    (15.0, 14.5), # End of valid subpath
    (15.0, 19.0), # New waypoint to avoid Obstacle 4
    (19.0, 18.5)  # End in the goal set
]
```

This adjusted path should successfully navigate from the start to the goal, passing through the required breakpoint, and avoiding all obstacles.
