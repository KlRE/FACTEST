# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[19.4, 10.7], [17.7, 10.6], [18.5, 0.5], [19.7, 0.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[5.9, 3.7], [16.0, 1.2], [17.3, 6.8], [14.7, 7.9]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 0.47), (9.0, 13.58)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]

[08/28/2024 03:34:56 PM] new_path = Here's a possible path solution, keeping in mind the requirements:

**Analysis:**

* The path needs to navigate around the two obstacles while passing through one of the breakpoints. 
* The start position is a small square, and the goal position is another square relatively far away, with obstacles in between.

**Chosen Path:**

1. Start at (1.0, 1.0) within the start set.
2. Move to a breakpoint by passing through (9.0, 0.47) from Breakpoint Set 1. 
3. Continue upwards to (9.0, 14.0) to avoid Obstacle 2.
4. Move rightwards to (19.0, 14.0), staying clear above Obstacle 1.
5. Finally, move diagonally downwards to (19.0, 19.0) within the goal set.

**Path Array:**

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 0.47), # Pass through the breakpoint 
    (9.0, 14.0), # Move upwards to avoid Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 14.0), # Move rightwards above Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End within the goal set
]
```

**Verification:**

* This path ensures that no obstacles are crossed. 
* It passes through one of the breakpoints in Breakpoint Set 1.
* The path starts within the start set and ends within the goal set.

This is a simple, straightforward path that meets all the given requirements.

[08/28/2024 03:35:03 PM] new_path = The current path faces an issue with the second segment intersecting obstacle 2. To resolve this, we need to adjust the path to circumvent this obstacle.  Let's analyze the situation:

* The initial segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (9.0, 0.47) is valid and hits a breakpoint.
* The next segment, (9.0, 0.47) to (9.0, 14.0), directly cuts through obstacle 2. 
* Our goal is to find a way around obstacle 2 while still reaching the goal set and passing through a breakpoint.

**Solution:**

1. **Circumnavigate Obstacle 2:**  Since obstacle 2 extends to the right of our path, we can try going around it to the left. We need to find a waypoint that avoids obstacle 2 and connects to the next breakpoint. 
2. **Utilize Breakpoint:**  We have a breakpoint at (9.0, 13.58), which is above obstacle 2. We can adjust our path to reach this breakpoint.

**New Path:**

* Start from the valid subpath ending at (9.0, 0.47).
* Add a new waypoint to the left of obstacle 2: (6.0, 0.47).
* Connect this waypoint to the breakpoint (9.0, 13.58).
* Continue the path to the goal set.

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start
    (9.0, 0.47),  # Breakpoint
    (6.0, 0.47),  # New waypoint left of obstacle 2
    (9.0, 13.58),  # Breakpoint 
    (19.0, 13.58), # Move right towards the goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End in the goal set
]
```

This new path avoids obstacle 2 by going around its left side, utilizes a breakpoint, and reaches the goal set.

[08/28/2024 03:35:12 PM] new_path = To correct the path and ensure it avoids the obstacles while meeting all requirements, let's break down the problem and adjust the path accordingly:

## Thought Process

1. **Analyze the Valid Subpath:**
   - The initial valid subpath is [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 0.47), (6.0, 0.47)]. This segment ends at the second breakpoint.

2. **Identify the Intersection:**
   - The segment from (6.0, 0.47) to (9.0, 13.58) intersects with Obstacle 2. We need to adjust this segment to avoid the obstacle.

3. **Obstacle Avoidance Strategy:**
   - To avoid Obstacle 2, let's explore a path that circumvents the obstacle by going around it from the left. Since the top and right sides of Obstacle 2 are constrained by the position of the breakpoint and the other obstacles, moving left is a more viable option.
  
4. **Connect to Goal Set:**
   - Once past the obstacle, we can move upwards to connect to the goal set. We will need to ensure we do not intersect Obstacle 1 in the process.

## Path Adjustments

1. **Avoiding Obstacle 2:**
   - From (6.0, 0.47), we can move left to bypass the obstacle:
     - Move to (3.0, 0.47)
   
2. **Connecting to the Goal:**
   - From (3.0, 0.47), move upwards, ensuring not to hit Obstacle 1.
   - Move to (3.0, 14.0).

3. **Reach the Goal Set:**
   - From (3.0, 14.0), move directly to the goal set:
     - Move to (19.0, 19.0).

## New Path

Here is the adjusted path:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start point within start set
    (9.0, 0.47),     # Valid breakpoint
    (6.0, 0.47),     # End of the valid subpath
    (3.0, 0.47),     # Move left to avoid Obstacle 2
    (3.0, 14.0),     # Move upwards
    (19.0, 19.0)     # End point within the goal set
]
```

This new path starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, avoids all obstacles, and passes through the required breakpoints.
