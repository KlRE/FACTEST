# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[13.9, 17.7], [10.7, 17.7], [11.7, 15.1], [13.8, 15.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[16.2, 18.7], [15.9, 13.1], [16.2, 12.1], [17.4, 15.4]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 10.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate

[08/28/2024 03:36:23 PM] new_path = Here's a possible path that incorporates the requirements:

**Path Array:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 10.0),   # Pass through the breakpoint
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Start:** The path starts at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start set quadrilateral.

2. **Breakpoint:** The path passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 10.0) from the Breakpoint Set 1.

3. **End:** The path ends at (19.0, 19.0), which is within the goal set quadrilateral.

**Obstacle Avoidance:**

- The path directly connects the waypoints, creating two segments: 
  - From (1.0, 1.0) to (9.0, 10.0)
  - From (9.0, 10.0) to (19.0, 19.0)

- These segments do not cross or touch any of the obstacles. The path goes around the first obstacle by passing above and to the right, maintaining a safe distance from its edges.

**Note:** This is just one possible solution. There may be alternative paths that fulfill the requirements while avoiding the obstacles.

[08/28/2024 03:36:30 PM] new_path = ### Thought Process

1. **Analyze Feedback:** The problem lies in the second segment of the path which intersects with Obstacle 2. We need to find a way to bypass this obstacle.

2. **Obstacle Avoidance:** To avoid Obstacle 2, we'll need to route the path around it. This means finding a clear path that maintains a safe distance from the obstacle.

3. **Maintain Breakpoints:** The path must still pass through the given breakpoint (9.0, 10.0).

4. **Consider Starting and Ending Points:** The path should still start within the start set and end within the goal set.

### Path Adjustments

1. **Use Longest Valid Subpath:** Since the first segment of the path is valid, we can start the new path from (1.0, 1.0) to (9.0, 10.0).

2. **Bypass Obstacle:** Instead of heading straight to (19.0, 19.0), which causes an intersection, we can add a waypoint to navigate around Obstacle 2:
   - Navigate around the bottom-right of Obstacle 2 at a safe distance. 
   - Consider adding a waypoint near (14.0, 12.0) to avoid the obstacle.

3. **Reach Goal:** Finally, connect to a point within the goal set.

### New Path

Considering the adjustments needed to bypass Obstacle 2 while maintaining the requirements, the new path could be:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start point
    (9.0, 10.0), # Breakpoint
    (14.0, 12.0), # Waypoint to avoid Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End point in the goal set
]
```

This new path starts correctly, passes through the necessary breakpoint, avoids any intersections with obstacles (including a safe distance from Obstacle 2), and ends in the goal set.

[08/28/2024 03:36:37 PM] new_path = Sure! Let's adjust the path to address the obstacle collision issue.  

### Thought Process:

1. **Identify the problem segment:** The segment between (14.0, 12.0) and (19.0, 19.0) intersects with Obstacle 2.

2. **Longest valid subpath:** The path up to (14.0, 12.0) is valid, so we'll use it as a starting point.

3. **Obstacle avoidance:** To avoid Obstacle 2, we need to route around it. We can try moving the path to the left and above the obstacle.

4. **Adjusting the path:**  We'll add a new waypoint to navigate around Obstacle 2. Let's place the new waypoint at (17.0, 14.0), which is to the left of Obstacle 2.

5. **Final segment:** The final segment connects the adjusted path to the goal set. We can connect (17.0, 14.0) to (19.0, 19.0) as the final waypoint.

### New Path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 10.0),
    (14.0, 12.0),
    (17.0, 14.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

### Explanation:

* The new waypoint (17.0, 14.0) ensures the path avoids Obstacle 2.
* The path maintains the required start, end, waypoint, and breakpoint conditions.
* The final segment from (17.0, 14.0) to (19.0, 19.0) connects the adjusted path to the goal set.

    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]

[08/28/2024 03:36:44 PM] new_path = The current path encounters a problem with Obstacle 2. The segment connecting (14.0, 12.0) and (17.0, 14.0) intersects with it. To solve this, we'll adjust the path to avoid the obstacle while maintaining the other requirements.

**Analysis of the Environment:**

* Obstacle 2 extends upwards and slightly to the left from the path's current trajectory.
* A potential workaround is to navigate around Obstacle 2 by moving slightly left and then back towards the goal.

**Path Adjustments:**

1. **Utilize the Valid Subpath:**  We'll keep the valid subpath [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 10.0), (14.0, 12.0)].
2. **Navigate Around Obstacle 2:**  From (14.0, 12.0), we'll move slightly left and then back towards the goal.
3. **Avoid Obstacle 1:**  Ensure the path doesn't intersect with Obstacle 1.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start
    (9.0, 10.0),    # Breakpoint Set 1
    (14.0, 12.0),   # Valid subpath point
    (13.5, 14.0),   # Move slightly left and up to avoid Obstacle 2
    (15.0, 15.0),   # Move back towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End in goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

* The new path avoids the problematic segment by moving slightly left and up to (13.5, 14.0), ensuring it doesn't intersect Obstacle 2.
* It then progresses towards (15.0, 15.0), staying clear of Obstacle 1, before reaching the final goal point (19.0, 19.0).

## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.

[08/28/2024 03:36:53 PM] new_path = To adjust the path and avoid intersection with Obstacle 2, let's analyze the problem and make necessary changes:

### Analysis:
1. **Starting Point:** The path starts correctly within the start set at (1.0, 1.0).
2. **Breakpoint:** The path successfully passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 10.0).
3. **End Point:** The path ends in the goal set at (19.0, 19.0).
4. **Obstacle 2 Intersection:** The segment between (15.0, 15.0) and (19.0, 19.0) intersects with Obstacle 2, specifically at the coordinates [(16.2, 18.7), (15.9, 13.1), (16.2, 12.1), (17.4, 15.4)].

### Plan for Adjustment:
1. **Avoid Obstacle 2:** We need to route the path around Obstacle 2 without touching any of its vertices. 
2. **Adding a Waypoint:** Introduce a new waypoint before the segment that intersects with the obstacle, guiding the path around it.

### Adjusted Path:
1. **Start:** Begin at (1.0, 1.0).
2. **Breakpoint:** Move to (9.0, 10.0).
3. **Waypoint 1:** Go to (14.0, 12.0).
4. **Waypoint 2:** Move to (13.5, 14.0).
5. **Waypoint 3:** Avoid Obstacle 2 by adding a new waypoint, e.g., (15.0, 16.0), passing above the obstacle.
6. **Waypoint 4:** Connect to the previous good segment by moving to (18.0, 17.0).
7. **End:** Finish at (19.0, 19.0) within the goal set.

### New Path:
```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),        # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 10.0),       # Pass through the breakpoint
    (14.0, 12.0),      # Existing waypoint
    (13.5, 14.0),      # Existing waypoint
    (15.0, 16.0),      # New waypoint to avoid Obstacle 2
    (18.0, 17.0),      # Connect back to the end segment
    (19.0, 19.0)       # End within the goal set
]
```

This new path retains all original requirements, avoids all obstacles, and successfully directs the route around Obstacle 2.

[08/28/2024 03:37:00 PM] new_path = To fix the path and avoid intersecting with Obstacle 2, let's analyze and adjust the path segments.

### Analysis

1. **Start Point & Breakpoint:**
   - The path starts at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start set.
   - It passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 10.0), satisfying the breakpoint requirement.

2. **Problematic Segment:**
   - The segment between (15.0, 16.0) and (18.0, 17.0) intersects with Obstacle 2.

3. **Valid Subpath:**
   - The valid subpath ends at (15.0, 16.0).

### Path Adjustments

To avoid Obstacle 2, we need to adjust the segment after the last valid point (15.0, 16.0).

1. **Bypass Obstacle 2:**
   - From (15.0, 16.0), we need to go around Obstacle 2 to reach the goal set.
   - Instead of moving towards (18.0, 17.0), move slightly to the right and down to avoid crossing the obstacle.

2. **Refine Final Segments:**
   - Ensure the path gracefully reaches the goal set without entering any obstacles.

### New Path Proposal

The new path avoids Obstacle 2 and ends in the goal set.

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within start set
    (9.0, 10.0),  # Pass through breakpoint
    (14.0, 12.0),
    (13.5, 14.0),
    (15.0, 16.0), # Last valid point before intersection
    (15.5, 15.5), # Adjust course towards the goal around obstacles
    (17.0, 16.0), # Slight right, staying clear of Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End in the goal set
]
```

This path maintains a safe distance from Obstacle 2 while passing through the necessary breakpoints and reaching the goal.
