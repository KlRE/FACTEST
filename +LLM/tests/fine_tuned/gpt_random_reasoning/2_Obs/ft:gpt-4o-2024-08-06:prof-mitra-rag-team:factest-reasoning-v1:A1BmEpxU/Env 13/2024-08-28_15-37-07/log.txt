# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[19.8, 12.4], [15.7, 13.5], [18.3, 1.8], [19.1, 4.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[13.9, 19.4], [5.3, 16.0], [17.8, 10.0], [18.1, 12.8]]

		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 6.11), (9.0, 19.73)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate

[08/28/2024 03:37:12 PM] new_path = Here's a possible path considering the constraints:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 6.11),  # Pass through the first breakpoint
    (14.0, 10.0), # Navigate around the obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Start:** The path begins at (1.0, 1.0), a point within the start quadrilateral.

2. **Breakpoint 1:** It then moves to (9.0, 6.11), passing through the first breakpoint set.

3. **Obstacle Avoidance:** The path proceeds to (14.0, 10.0), carefully navigating around the obstacles. By staying clear of the vertex of Obstacle 2 and moving in a direction that stays away from Obstacle 1, the path avoids collisions.

4. **Goal:** Finally, the path reaches (19.0, 19.0), a point within the goal quadrilateral. This fulfills the requirement to end within the goal set.

This path ensures that each requirement is met: it begins within the start region, passes through a breakpoint from each set, avoids collisions with obstacles, and finishes within the goal region.

[08/28/2024 03:37:20 PM] new_path = To correct the path and avoid the obstacles, let's analyze each segment and make adjustments accordingly.

### Analysis

1. **Starting Point:** The path starts at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start set. This is correct.
   
2. **First Segment:** The path goes from (1.0, 1.0) to (9.0, 6.11). This segment is valid and passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 6.11).

3. **Second Segment:** The path continues from (9.0, 6.11) to (14.0, 10.0). This segment is also valid and does not intersect any obstacles.

4. **Third Segment:** The problematic segment is between (14.0, 10.0) and (19.0, 19.0). This segment intersects with both Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2.

### Adjustments

To avoid the obstacles, we need to adjust the third segment:

1. **Identify a New Waypoint:** Find a new waypoint to avoid the obstacles while maintaining a safe distance. We will add an intermediate waypoint.

2. **Adjust the Path:**

   - **Original Segment:** (14.0, 10.0) → (19.0, 19.0)
   - **New Segment:** We will introduce a new waypoint, say (15.5, 13.0), that navigates the path between the obstacles.

### New Path

Based on the above analysis, the adjusted path can be:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),           # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 6.11),          # Pass through the first breakpoint
    (14.0, 10.0),         # Move towards the goal
    (15.5, 13.0),         # New waypoint to avoid obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)          # End within the goal set
]
```

This new path should start in the start set, pass through a breakpoint, avoid the obstacles, and end in the goal set.

[08/28/2024 03:37:32 PM] new_path = To adjust the provided path and avoid the obstacles, let's analyze the situation:

### Current Path and Issues
1. **Given Path**: [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 6.11), (14.0, 10.0), (15.5, 13.0), (19.0, 19.0)]
2. **Problem**: The segment between (14.0, 10.0) and (15.5, 13.0) intersects with Obstacle 2: [[13.9, 19.4], [5.3, 16.0], [17.8, 10.0], [18.1, 12.8]].

### Strategy for Correction
- **Identify Valid Subpath**: The valid subpath from the start is [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 6.11), (14.0, 10.0)]. 
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: We need to adjust the path after (14.0, 10.0) to avoid Obstacle 2.

### Adjusting the Path
1. **Avoiding Obstacle 2**: 
   - From (14.0, 10.0), move upwards and slightly to the right to avoid the obstacle.
   
2. **Path to Goal**:
   - Once clear of the obstacle, navigate towards the goal set.

### New Path
1. **Start Point**: (1.0, 1.0) – inside the start set.
2. **Breakpoint**: (9.0, 6.11) – passes through a breakpoint.
3. **Clear Obstacle 2**: (14.0, 10.0) – unchanged, then move upwards.
4. **Adjust Path**:
   - Add a waypoint to go above the obstacle.
5. **Finish Point**: (19.0, 19.0) – inside the goal set.

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 6.11),
    (14.0, 10.0),
    (14.5, 13.5), # Adjust to clear obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

### Explanation
- The new path avoids the intersection by moving slightly upwards before continuing towards the goal.
- This adjustment allows the path to clear Obstacle 2 and reach the goal safely. The new waypoint at (14.5, 13.5) ensures a safe distance from the obstacle.

### Justification for Adjustments
- This path now appropriately avoids the obstacles, starts within the start set, ends within the goal set, and passes through a required breakpoint.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:

[08/28/2024 03:37:39 PM] new_path = ### Analysis and Path Adjustment

The initial path has a collision with Obstacle 2. Let's adjust the path to avoid it, ensuring it still passes through the breakpoints and stays within the start and goal sets.

### Validating Existing Segments

1. **Segment 1:** (1.0, 1.0) to (9.0, 6.11) is valid.
2. **Segment 2:** (9.0, 6.11) to (14.0, 10.0) is valid.

### Problematic Segment

- **Segment 3:** (14.0, 10.0) to (14.5, 13.5) intersects Obstacle 2.

### Obstacle Avoidance Strategy

- Since the path ends at a dead end after the collision, we need to adjust Segment 3 to circumnavigate Obstacle 2.

### Proposed Path Adjustments

1. **New Waypoint:** Add a point on the right side of Obstacle 2, ensuring the path avoids intersection.

### New Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),           # Start point
    (9.0, 6.11),          # Breakpoint 1
    (14.0, 10.0),         # Valid point before collision
    (18.5, 14.0),         # New waypoint to avoid Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)          # End point within the goal set
]
```

### Explanation of Changes

- The new waypoint (18.5, 14.0) is strategically placed to the right of Obstacle 2, enabling the path to curve around and avoid the collision.
- The final waypoint is adjusted to ensure it remains within the goal set.

This new path maintains the original requirements while successfully avoiding the obstacles.

## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.

[08/28/2024 03:37:51 PM] new_path = ### Analysis and Path Adjustment

To create a valid path that avoids obstacles and adheres to the requirements, let's address the problem:

1. **Current Path Issues:** The segment between (14.0, 10.0) and (14.0, 14.0) intersects with Obstacle 2.
2. **Valid Subpath:** The current subpath [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 6.11), (14.0, 10.0)] is valid.

### **Proposed Adjustments:**

1. **Extend the Valid Subpath:** Continue the path from (14.0, 10.0) and adjust the subsequent segments to navigate around Obstacle 2.

2. **Planning to Avoid Obstacle 2:**
    - Move up and to the right to avoid the top edge of Obstacle 2.
    - Navigate towards the goal set without crossing any additional obstacles.

### **New Path:**

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start in the start set
    (9.0, 6.11), # Use the breakpoint
    (14.0, 10.0), # Avoids obstacles
    (16.0, 15.0), # Moves towards goal while avoiding Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Ends within the goal set
]
```

### **Explanation of Adjustments:**

- **Segment (14.0, 10.0) to (16.0, 15.0):** This segment moves slightly right and up, staying clear of Obstacle 2's top edge.
- **Segment (16.0, 15.0) to (19.0, 19.0):** This segment moves directly to the goal set, ensuring it doesn’t intersect with any obstacles.

This adjustment ensures the path is valid, starts within the start set, ends within the goal set, passes through a breakpoint, and avoids all obstacles.
