# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[18.9, 14.3], [10.9, 13.2], [12.7, 1.9], [18.6, 12.1]]
			Obstacle 2: [[1.2, 16.1], [10.2, 15.4], [12.8, 17.5], [10.9, 17.5]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 6.74), (9.0, 19.61)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

[08/28/2024 03:33:03 PM] new_path = To create a path that adheres to the requirements, let's break down the components.

### Start and End Points
- **Start Quadrilateral:** [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
  - Choose a start point like (1.0, 1.0) within this quadrilateral.
- **Goal Quadrilateral:** [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
  - Choose an end point like (19.0, 19.0) within this quadrilateral.

### Breakpoints and Obstacle Avoidance
- **Breakpoint Set 1:** Use (9.0, 6.74).

### Planning the Path
We need to ensure the path avoids Obstacle 1 and 2.

1. **Start Point:** (1.0, 1.0)
2. **Pass Breakpoint:** (9.0, 6.74)
3. **Avoid Obstacles:** Adjust waypoint to move around obstacles, potentially using waypoints that shift to navigate the space.
4. **End Point:** (19.0, 19.0)

### Example Path
This path ensures it's well away from the obstacles:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 6.74), 
    (15.0, 15.0),  # Intermediate waypoint to bypass obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This path starts within the start quadrilateral, passes through the required breakpoint, bypasses the obstacles safely, and ends within the goal quadrilateral.

[08/28/2024 03:33:09 PM] new_path = To adjust the path and avoid the obstacles, let's analyze the situation and find a viable route:

### Current Path Issues
- The path from (9.0, 6.74) to (15.0, 15.0) intersects with Obstacle 1. 
- We need to reroute this segment to avoid the obstacle.

### Strategy for Adjustment
- Since the segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (9.0, 6.74) is valid, we'll keep it.
- To avoid Obstacle 1, we can try moving to a point above the obstacle and then proceed towards the goal.

### Adjusted Path
1. **Start at (1.0, 1.0):** Same as initial valid point.
2. **Move to (9.0, 6.74):** Use this breakpoint for validity.
3. **Navigate around Obstacle 1:**
    - Add a waypoint above Obstacle 1 to ensure clearance.
4. **Proceed towards the goal:**
    - Find a path that ends inside the goal set.

### New Path Proposal
```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),          # Start 
    (9.0, 6.74),         # Breakpoint 1
    (15.0, 17.0),        # Waypoint above Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 18.0)         # End within goal set
]
```

This adjusted path should avoid Obstacle 1 by going around it, ensuring no intersection occurs.

[08/28/2024 03:33:16 PM] new_path = To adjust the path and avoid obstacles, I'll analyze the given path, obstacles, and constraints:

### Current Path
- **Valid portion:** `[(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 6.74)]`
- **Problematic segment:** `[(9.0, 6.74), (15.0, 17.0)]` intersects Obstacle 1.

### Obstacle Analysis
- **Obstacle 1:** [[18.9, 14.3], [10.9, 13.2], [12.7, 1.9], [18.6, 12.1]]
    - It's challenging to navigate directly through the narrow gap without intersecting this obstacle.

### Adjusted Path Strategy
1. **Use a Breakpoint:** Utilize the given breakpoint `(9.0, 6.74)`.
2. **Circumvent Obstacle 1:** Adjust the path to navigate around Obstacle 1 on its left or right side.
3. **End in Goal Set:** Ensure the path reaches the goal set correctly.

### New Path Proposal
1. **Start:** `(1.0, 1.0)` (within the start set)
2. **First Breakpoint:** `(9.0, 6.74)` (valid and avoids initial obstacle)
3. **Avoid Obstacle:** Add a waypoint that navigates the path upwards and around Obstacle 1, e.g., `(9.0, 14.0)`. 
4. **Final Segment:** End within the goal set, e.g., `(19.0, 18.0)`.

### New Path
```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),       # Start
    (9.0, 6.74),      # First Breakpoint
    (9.0, 14.0),      # New Waypoint to avoid Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 18.0)      # End in Goal Set
]
```

### Explanation
- This path starts within the start set, uses the first breakpoint, avoids Obstacle 1 by going above it, and successfully ends inside the goal set. This adjustment should maintain path safety and avoid all obstacles.
