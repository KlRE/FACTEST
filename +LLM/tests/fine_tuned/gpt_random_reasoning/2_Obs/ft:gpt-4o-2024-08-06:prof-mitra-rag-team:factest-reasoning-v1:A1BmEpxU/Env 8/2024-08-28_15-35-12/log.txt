# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[17.2, 15.9], [19.5, 11.3], [19.3, 13.7], [17.4, 18.1]]
			Obstacle 2: [[17.2, 13.6], [11.8, 3.6], [17.3, 2.0], [19.7, 2.7]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 10.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

[08/28/2024 03:35:18 PM] new_path = Here's a possible path solution, considering the provided quadrilaterals, obstacles, and breakpoints:

**Understanding the Setup**

* **Start Position:** I chose the point (1.0, 1.0) within the start quadrilateral.
* **Goal Position:** I chose the point (19.0, 19.0) within the goal quadrilateral.
* **Obstacle Avoidance:**  I ensured the path doesn't intersect with the obstacle quadrilaterals.
* **Breakpoints:** I included one of the breakpoints.

**Proposed Path**

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 10.0),  # Pass through the breakpoint
    (18.0, 18.0), # Move towards the goal ensuring no intersection with obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation**

1. **Start:** The path commences at (1.0, 1.0) within the start quadrilateral.
2. **Through Breakpoint:** It moves to the breakpoint (9.0, 10.0), satisfying the requirement to pass through a breakpoint.
3. **Towards Goal:**  Progresses toward the goal while ensuring a safe distance from obstacles.
4. **End:** Concludes at (19.0, 19.0) within the goal quadrilateral.

**Spatial Analysis**

* **Obstacle 1** is avoided by staying to the left of its leftmost vertex.
* **Obstacle 2** is circumvented by moving above its topmost vertex.
* The path maintains a safe margin from both obstacles, ensuring no intersection.

[08/28/2024 03:35:24 PM] new_path = The path needs to be adjusted to avoid Obstacle 1.  Since the path already passes through the breakpoint and I don’t see an easy alternative, let's try to work from the goal set backward:

1. **Current Issue:** The segment between (9.0, 10.0) and (18.0, 18.0) intersects Obstacle 1.
2. **Avoidance Strategy:** We need to navigate to the right of Obstacle 1 without straying too far from the goal.

Here's a plan:

* **New Path:**
    * Start at (1.0, 1.0)
    * Move to the breakpoint (9.0, 10.0)
    * Direct next waypoint slightly right and up, say (17.8, 13.8). This point is chosen to avoid the top right corner of Obstacle 1.
    * Proceed to the goal set, for example, choosing (18.5, 19.0) as the next waypoint to ensure a safe approach with ample clearance.
    * Finally, end at a point inside the goal set, perhaps (19.0, 19.0), ensuring it finishes within bounds.

**Proposed Path:**

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    
    (9.0, 10.0),
    (17.8, 13.8),
    (18.5, 19.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)       
]
```

This path should now pass through the breakpoint without colliding with any obstacles and reach the goal set safely.

[08/28/2024 03:35:30 PM] new_path = The path needs to be adjusted to avoid intersecting with Obstacle 2.  Let's analyze the situation:

1. **Valid Subpath:** The path [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 10.0)] is valid as it doesn't intersect any obstacles.
2. **Obstacle Interaction:** The segment connecting (9.0, 10.0) and (17.8, 13.8) intersects Obstacle 2.
3. **Spatial Analysis:**  To avoid Obstacle 2, we need to navigate around it. Since Obstacle 2 is positioned below the valid subpath, we can adjust the path to go above the obstacle.

### Revised Path:

1. **Continue from Valid Subpath:** [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 10.0)]
2. **Navigate Above Obstacle 2:** We can add a waypoint above and to the right of (9.0, 10.0) to avoid the obstacle.
3. **Proceed to the Goal:** From this new waypoint, we can then navigate towards the goal set, ensuring the path doesn't intersect any other obstacles.

### New Path:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Starting point
    (9.0, 10.0),   # Breakpoint from the set
    (12.0, 15.0),  # New waypoint to avoid Obstacle 2 by going above it
    (18.5, 19.0),  # Approach goal set from above the obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End point within the goal set
]
```

This new path utilizes the valid subpath and adds a waypoint to navigate around Obstacle 2. It then proceeds to the goal while maintaining a safe distance from all obstacles.
