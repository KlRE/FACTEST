# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[11.4, 18.3], [10.0, 15.9], [10.3, 15.8], [11.8, 16.9]]
			Obstacle 2: [[4.8, 9.5], [9.0, 0.3], [10.5, 0.8], [7.3, 9.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, -0.85), (9.0, 13.32)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/28/2024 03:39:58 PM] new_path = To create a path that meets the specified requirements, we need to carefully navigate from the start region to the goal region while avoiding the given obstacles. Here's a proposed path based on the provided information:

### Analysis

1. **Start Set:** We have a quadrilateral defined by the vertices \((2.0, 2.0), (-0.0, 2.0), (-0.0, -0.0), (2.0, -0.0)\). We can start from a point within this quadrilateral, for simplicity, let's choose the point \((1.0, 1.0)\).

2. **Goal Set:** Similarly, the goal region is a quadrilateral defined by \((20.0, 20.0), (18.0, 20.0), (18.0, 18.0), (20.0, 18.0)\). A possible endpoint within this region could be \((19.0, 19.0)\).

3. **Breakpoints:** We must include a breakpoint from the set \{(9.0, -0.85), (9.0, 13.32)\} in our path. Let's choose \((9.0, 13.32)\) for this example.

4. **Obstacles:** Weâ€™ll avoid the obstacles \([[11.4, 18.3], [10.0, 15.9], [10.3, 15.8], [11.8, 16.9]]\) and \([[4.8, 9.5], [9.0, 0.3], [10.5, 0.8], [7.3, 9.0]]\).

### Path Design

A possible path avoiding the obstacles could be:

1. **Waypoint 1:** Start at \((1.0, 1.0)\) within the start region.
2. **Waypoint 2:** Move to a point that's free of obstacles but higher than both obstacles \((5.0, 14.0)\).
3. **Waypoint 3:** Pass through the breakpoint \((9.0, 13.32)\).
4. **Waypoint 4:** Continue to a point that's away from obstacles but moving towards the goal region \((15.0, 18.0)\).
5. **Waypoint 5:** Finally, move to the goal region stopping at \((19.0, 19.0)\) within the goal quadrilateral.

### Path

Thus, the path as an array of waypoints could be:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start
    (5.0, 14.0),    # Intermediate point avoiding obstacles
    (9.0, 13.32),   # Breakpoint
    (15.0, 18.0),   # Intermediate point closer to the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End
]
```

### Verification

This path ensures:

- **Non-Crossing:** Avoids any intersection with obstacles.
- **Start and End:** Begins in the start set, ends in the goal set.
- **Breakpoints:** Passes through the required breakpoint \((9.0, 13.32)\).

This path should be manually checked or plotted to ensure compliance with the task requirements and environment constraints.
