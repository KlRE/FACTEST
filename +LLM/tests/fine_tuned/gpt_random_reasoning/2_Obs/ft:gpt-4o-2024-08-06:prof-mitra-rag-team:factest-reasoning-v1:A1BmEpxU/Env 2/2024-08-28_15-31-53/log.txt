# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[10.4, 13.8], [14.7, 9.7], [20.0, 13.3], [10.5, 15.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[17.6, 6.4], [19.4, 6.3], [19.0, 8.1], [18.3, 11.1]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 10.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

[08/28/2024 03:31:59 PM] new_path = Here's a path plan considering the provided start, goal, obstacles, and breakpoint:

### Path Analysis

1. **Start**: Select a start point within the start quadrilateral, for instance, (1.0, 1.0).
2. **Breakpoint**: The path must pass through the breakpoint (9.0, 10.0).
3. **Goal**: Choose an endpoint within the goal quadrilateral, like (19.0, 19.0).
4. **Obstacles**: We need to avoid the two obstacle quadrilaterals.

Let's carefully construct a path using these:

### Planned Path

1. **Start**: (1.0, 1.0) 
2. **Waypoint 1**: (5.0, 5.0) - Move diagonally upwards and right, staying clear of obstacle boundaries.
3. **Breakpoint**: (9.0, 10.0) - Reach the breakpoint.
4. **Waypoint 2**: (15.0, 16.0) - Continue moving up and right, passing above Obstacle 1.
5. **Goal**: (19.0, 19.0) - Finally, reach the goal.

### Path Format

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), 
    (5.0, 5.0), 
    (9.0, 10.0), 
    (15.0, 16.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

### Explanation

- **Obstacle Avoidance**: The selected waypoints ensure the path stays clear of the obstacle quadrilaterals.
- **Linear Segments**: Connecting these waypoints linearly does not cause the path to intersect any obstacles.

This path starts within the start set, passes through the required breakpoint, and ends within the goal set, successfully avoiding all obstacles.

## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]

		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 10.0)]

## Your generated path:

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(1.0, 1.0), (5.0, 5.0), (9.0, 10.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

[08/28/2024 03:32:05 PM] new_path = The provided path has the following issues and valid segments:

**Issues:**

* **Segment 3:**  Connects (9.0, 10.0) and (15.0, 16.0) but intersects with Obstacle 1.

**Valid Path:**

* **Subpath:**  [(1.0, 1.0), (5.0, 5.0), (9.0, 10.0)] 

**Path Adjustment:**

1. **Analyze obstacle:**  Obstacle 1 has a somewhat "C" shape. We can potentially navigate around it by moving above it. 
2. **Add waypoints:**  Instead of connecting directly to (15.0, 16.0), we can add a waypoint above Obstacle 1. 

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (5.0, 5.0),
    (9.0, 10.0),
    (9.0, 16.0),  # Move upward to avoid Obstacle 1
    (15.0, 16.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

**Explanation:**

By adding the waypoint (9.0, 16.0), we move the path above Obstacle 1, ensuring it doesn't intersect. We then continue to (15.0, 16.0) and finally to the goal set at (19.0, 19.0). This adjustment ensures the path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles.
