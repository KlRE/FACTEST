# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.4, 11.1], [15.5, 8.9], [19.4, 8.8], [19.2, 9.6]]
			Obstacle 2: [[15.0, 13.4], [6.9, 5.2], [11.5, 5.9], [19.1, 11.6]]
			Obstacle 3: [[17.6, 19.8], [15.3, 19.1], [15.4, 11.6], [15.8, 6.7]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 1.76), (9.0, 14.66)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]

[08/28/2024 03:52:53 PM] new_path = Here's a path that avoids the obstacles and meets the requirements:

**new_path = [[1.0, 2.0], [8.8, 5.01], [8.09, 19.0], [19.0, 19.0]]**

**Explanation:**

1. **Start:** The path begins at (1.0, 2.0), which lies within the start quadrilateral.
2. **Avoiding Obstacle 2:** The path then goes to (8.8, 5.01), carefully navigating around obstacle 2. This point is strategically chosen; its y-coordinate is just above the highest point of obstacle 2, ensuring no intersection.
3. **Breakpoint & Avoiding Obstacle 3:** The path moves upwards to (8.09, 19.0), passing through the breakpoint (9.0, 14.66) on the way. This segment steers clear of obstacle 3, which lies to the right.
4. **Goal:** Finally, it reaches (19.0, 19.0), well within the goal quadrilateral. 

**Key Points:**

* The path smoothly navigates around obstacles 2 and 3 by leveraging the open space between them.
* By passing through the breakpoint (9.0, 14.66), the path adheres to the requirement.
* The path does not intersect any obstacles at any point. 
* The linear segments connecting these waypoints avoid crossing any obstacles as well.

[08/28/2024 03:53:05 PM] new_path = Here’s how we can adjust the path, considering the feedback and obstacles:

### Analysis and Adjustments

1. **Start and Valid Subpath:**
   - The starting point \((1.0, 2.0)\) is valid, and the initial segment to \((8.8, 5.01)\) is acceptable.

2. **Breakpoint Requirement:**
   - We need to pass through one of the breakpoints in set \((9.0, 1.76)\) or \((9.0, 14.66)\).

3. **Obstacle Avoidance:**
   - The second segment \((8.8, 5.01)\) to \((8.09, 19.0)\) intersects Obstacle 2. We need to adjust this path to avoid the obstacle while fulfilling the breakpoint requirement.

4. **Proposed Path Adjustments:**
   - We can introduce a new waypoint that avoids Obstacle 2 by going through a breakpoint and then continues to the goal set.

### New Path

1. **Start in the start set:**
   - \((1.0, 2.0)\)

2. **Move towards a breakpoint while avoiding obstacles:**
   - \((8.8, 5.01)\) – Extend the valid subpath.
   - \((9.0, 5.5)\) – Move to a point close to the breakpoint \((9.0, 1.76)\) but avoiding the lower sides of Obstacle 2. 

3. **Continue to the goal set:**
   - \((9.0, 14.66)\) – Pass through the required breakpoint.
   - \((19.0, 19.0)\) – End in the goal set.

### Updated Path

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0),
    (8.8, 5.01),
    (9.0, 5.5),
    (9.0, 14.66),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This path starts correctly, passes through a required breakpoint, avoids all obstacles, and ends in the goal set.

[08/28/2024 03:53:12 PM] new_path = Here's a breakdown of my thought process and the adjustments made to the path:

**1. Analyzing the Valid Subpath:**

* The valid subpath from the feedback is [(1.0, 2.0), (8.8, 5.01), (9.0, 5.5)]. This subpath successfully navigates through the start set and avoids Obstacle 2.

**2. Identifying the Issue:**

* The problem arises with the segment between (9.0, 5.5) and (9.0, 14.66), which intersects with Obstacle 2.

**3. Obstacle Avoidance Strategy:**

* To avoid Obstacle 2, we need to adjust the path after the valid subpath.
* Instead of going directly up from (9.0, 5.5), we can create a "detour" around Obstacle 2.

**4. Path Adjustments:**

* From (9.0, 5.5), we can move slightly to the right to avoid Obstacle 2 and then move upwards to reach the breakpoint (9.0, 14.66).

**5. New Path:**

Based on the analysis, the new path will be:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0),  # Start within the start set
    (8.8, 5.01), # Valid subpath point
    (9.0, 5.5),  # Valid subpath point
    (10.0, 5.5), # Move slightly right to avoid Obstacle 2
    (10.0, 14.66), # Move upwards to the breakpoint
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End within the goal set
]
```

This adjusted path should successfully navigate from the start set to the goal set while avoiding all obstacles and passing through the required breakpoints.

[08/28/2024 03:53:21 PM] new_path = The path needs to be adjusted to avoid Obstacle 2 and to pass through a breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1. Here's how we can modify the path:

1. **Obstacle Avoidance:**  The problematic segment is the one going from (10.0, 5.5) to (10.0, 14.66), which crosses Obstacle 2. To avoid this obstacle, we can guide the path around it by going right and then up.

2. **Breakpoints:** We need to incorporate one of the breakpoints from Breakpoint Set 1. Since the path already incorporates (10.0, 14.66), we can use this point and adjust the path to reach it from a different angle.

### New Path

Here's the adjusted path:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0),  # start in the start set
    (8.8, 5.01), # move towards the breakpoint
    (9.0, 5.5),  # reach the first breakpoint 
    (15.0, 5.5),  # move rightwards to avoid Obstacle 2
    (15.0, 14.66), # move upwards to reach the second breakpoint
    (19.0, 19.0) # move to the goal set
]
```

### Explanation

* The path starts at (1.0, 2.0) within the start set.
* It moves to (8.8, 5.01) and then to (9.0, 5.5), passing through the first breakpoint.
*  To avoid Obstacle 2, the path then goes to (15.0, 5.5), moving rightwards.
* The path then goes up to (15.0, 14.66) and finally to (19.0, 19.0), reaching the second breakpoint and ending in the goal set.

This path now successfully avoids all obstacles and incorporates breakpoints from both sets.

[08/28/2024 03:53:30 PM] new_path = ### Analysis and Adjustments

Firstly, let's analyze the provided data and the path issues:

**Start:** The path correctly starts at \((1.0, 2.0)\), which is inside the start quadrilateral.

**End:** The path correctly ends at \((19.0, 19.0)\), inside the goal quadrilateral.

**Obstacle Issue:** The path's fourth segment \((15.0, 5.5)\) to \((15.0, 14.66)\) intersects with Obstacle 2. This needs to be avoided.

**Breakpoints:** The path must pass through at least one point from each breakpoint set. Here, either \((9.0, 1.76)\) or \((9.0, 14.66)\) should be used. Currently, none are used.

### Solution: Adjust Path

We'll adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles, use a breakpoint, and ensure a clear path from start to goal.

#### Steps:

1. **Avoid Obstacle Intersection:**
   - Add a waypoint before the problematic segment to reroute around Obstacle 2.
   - Use \((12.0, 5.5)\) to follow along the edge of Obstacle 2 safely.

2. **Incorporate Breakpoint:**
   - Incorporate \((9.0, 1.76)\) into the path to satisfy the breakpoint condition.

3. **Modify Waypoints:**
   - Start from \((1.0, 2.0)\), closely follow along a safe path avoiding obstacles, and finish at the goal.

#### New Path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0),       # Start
    (8.8, 5.01),      # Safe path
    (9.0, 1.76),      # Breakpoint 1
    (12.0, 5.5),      # Safe route near Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)      # End in goal set
]
```

### Explanation:

- We start at a point within the start quadrilateral.
- We incorporate the required breakpoint \((9.0, 1.76)\).
- The new segment \((8.8, 5.01)\) to \((12.0, 5.5)\) is carefully chosen to avoid Obstacle 2.
- The final segment smoothly leads to the goal within the goal set, completing the path.

This adjusted path meets all requirements, avoiding obstacles, using a breakpoint, and starting/ending in the correct regions.

[08/28/2024 03:53:40 PM] new_path = To adjust the path and avoid the obstacles, let's analyze the current path and the issues with it.

### Current Path
1. **Start:** The path starts at (1.0, 2.0) which is inside the start set. ✔️
2. **Breakpoint 1:** The path correctly passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 1.76) ✔️
3. **End:** The path ends at (19.0, 19.0) which is inside the goal set. ✔️

### Problem Area
The path segment from (12.0, 5.5) to (19.0, 19.0) intersects with obstacles 2 and 3. We need to find a route around these obstacles.

### Adjustments
1. **Analyzing the Obstacles:**
   - **Obstacle 2:** This is a long, diagonal obstacle. Any path needs to navigate around its edges.
   - **Obstacle 3:** This sits above obstacle 2.

2. **Finding a Gap:** 
   There's a gap between these two obstacles that can be used. We need to ensure the path goes through this gap.

3. **New Waypoints:**
   - From (12.0, 5.5), move horizontally to a safe point beyond obstacle 2 but below obstacle 3. Let's say (14.0, 5.5).
   - Then move upward through the gap, staying to the right of obstacle 2, to a point like (17.0, 14.0).
   - Finally, move to the goal set at (19.0, 19.0).

### New Path
Here’s the revised path ensuring no segment crosses an obstacle:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0),   # Start
    (8.8, 5.01),  # Near breakpoint 1
    (9.0, 1.76),  # Breakpoint 1
    (12.0, 5.5),  # Before the problematic segment
    (14.0, 5.5),  # Move horizontally to avoid Obstacle 2
    (17.0, 14.0), # Navigate through the gap between obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End in the goal set
]
```

This path maintains all required conditions:

- Starts in the start set
- Ends in the goal set
- Passes through a breakpoint from each set
- Avoids intersecting with any obstacles
