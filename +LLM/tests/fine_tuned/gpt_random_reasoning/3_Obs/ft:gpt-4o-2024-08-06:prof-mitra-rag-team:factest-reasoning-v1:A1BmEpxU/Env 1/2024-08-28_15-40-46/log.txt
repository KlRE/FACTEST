# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[16.6, 20.0], [15.6, 15.9], [15.6, 15.3], [19.9, 14.8]]
			Obstacle 2: [[5.1, 4.4], [13.8, 1.7], [13.5, 9.8], [11.4, 14.8]]
			Obstacle 3: [[5.1, 18.4], [6.6, 16.6], [7.5, 18.3], [5.5, 18.7]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 0.59), (9.0, 16.42)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

[08/28/2024 03:40:53 PM] new_path = To create a path that adheres to the given constraints, let's consider the start and goal areas, the obstacles, and the breakpoints. 

### Start and End Points
- **Start Point:** Let's choose (1.0, 1.0) within the start set quadrilateral.
- **Goal Point:** Let's choose (19.0, 19.0) within the goal set quadrilateral.

### Breakpoints
- **Breakpoint Set 1:** We'll choose the breakpoint (9.0, 0.59).

### Path Considerations
1. **Start to Breakpoint:** Connect the start point to the chosen breakpoint.
2. **Avoid Obstacles:** Make sure the path circumvents the given obstacles by selecting waypoints that steer clear of them.
3. **Breakpoint to Goal:** Connect to a point within the goal set while ensuring obstacle avoidance.

### Proposed Path
Here's a path that should satisfy the requirements:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start Point
    (5.0, 2.0),      # Steer towards the right, avoiding Obstacle 2
    (7.0, 8.0),      # Move up gradually
    (9.0, 0.59),     # Breakpoint 1
    (12.0, 16.0),    # Move upwards, avoiding Obstacle 3
    (19.0, 19.0)     # Goal Point
]
```

### Verification
- **Start and End:** The path begins in the start set and ends in the goal set.
- **Breakpoints:** Passes through the chosen breakpoint (9.0, 0.59).
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** The path avoids intersection with all defined obstacles. 

This solution ensures the path adheres to all specified constraints while maintaining a safe distance from obstacles.

[08/28/2024 03:41:01 PM] new_path = To address the issue with the original path colliding with Obstacle 2, let's analyze the spatial relationships and adjust the path accordingly.

### Current Path Analysis
1. **Start to (5.0, 2.0):** This segment is valid and avoids obstacles.
2. **(5.0, 2.0) to (7.0, 8.0):** This segment intersects with Obstacle 2. We need to find a way around this obstacle.
3. **Remaining segments:** We need to ensure the path passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 0.59) and ends in the goal set.

### Obstacle Avoidance Strategy
We can adjust the path to move around Obstacle 2:

1. **Bypass Obstacle 2:** From (5.0, 2.0), we can move slightly upwards first to avoid Obstacle 2, then continue towards the goal while ensuring the breakpoint is crossed.

### Adjusted Path Proposal
Let's propose a new path that avoids the obstacle:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start in start set
    (5.0, 2.0),      # Valid initial segment
    (5.0, 7.0),      # Move upwards to avoid Obstacle 2
    (9.0, 7.0),      # Move horizontally towards the breakpoint
    (9.0, 0.59),     # Pass through the breakpoint
    (16.0, 17.0),    # Move towards the goal avoiding obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)     # End in the goal set
]
```

### Explanation
* **(5.0, 7.0):** This point helps to bypass Obstacle 2 by moving above it.
* **(9.0, 7.0):** Moves horizontally towards the breakpoint (9.0, 0.59) while avoiding any obstacles.
* **(16.0, 17.0):** Moves towards the goal, carefully planning around the layout of other obstacles.
* **End Point:** The path ends successfully within the goal set.

This path maintains all constraints: it starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, passes through the required breakpoint, and avoids any intersections with obstacles.

### Current Path Analysis
1. **Start Point:** `(1.0, 1.0)` is valid within the start set.
2. **End Point:** `(19.0, 19.0)` successfully falls within the goal set.
3. **Breakpoint Inclusion:** The path includes the breakpoint `(9.0, 0.59)`, which is required.

### Problematic Segment
- The segment from `(5.0, 7.0)` to `(9.0, 7.0)` intersects with Obstacle 2. We need to adjust this segment to avoid the obstacle.

### Obstacle Analysis
- **Obstacle 2** has vertices `[[5.1, 4.4], [13.8, 1.7], [13.5, 9.8], [11.4, 14.8]]`.

### Path Adjustment Strategy
1. **Avoid Obstacle 2:** We need to route around Obstacle 2 by adjusting the segment after `(5.0, 7.0)`.
2. **Maintain Breakpoint:** Ensure the path passes through the required breakpoint `(9.0, 0.59)`.

### New Path Proposal
1. Start at `(1.0, 1.0)`.
2. Proceed to `(5.0, 2.0)` and then `(5.0, 7.0)`.
3. Adjust the next segment to avoid Obstacle 2:
   - Move slightly upwards and to the left: `(5.0, 10.0)`.
   - Move to the right bypassing the obstacle's upper corner: `(10.0, 10.0)`.
4. Continue to the breakpoint: `(9.0, 0.59)`.
5. Finally, navigate towards the goal set:
   - `(16.0, 17.0)`.
   - End at `(19.0, 19.0)`.

### New Path
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (5.0, 2.0),
    (5.0, 7.0),
    (5.0, 10.0),

    (9.0, 0.59),
    (16.0, 17.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This new path should start and end correctly, pass through the breakpoint, and avoid intersecting all obstacles.

[08/28/2024 03:41:19 PM] new_path = The provided path encounters an issue with Obstacle 2.  Let's analyze and adjust the path to avoid it. 

**Analysis:**

* The longest valid subpath is [(1.0, 1.0), (5.0, 2.0), (5.0, 7.0), (5.0, 10.0)]. 
* The problematic segment is between (5.0, 10.0) and (10.0, 10.0). It intersects with Obstacle 2.
* We need to find a way to circumvent Obstacle 2.

**Strategy:**

* We can try to go around Obstacle 2 by moving upwards and then towards the goal.  
* Use the Breakpoint (9.0, 16.42) to help navigate around the obstacle.  

**Revised Path:**

1. **Start:** (1.0, 1.0) 
2. **Move Up:**  (5.0, 2.0) 
3. **Continue Up:** (5.0, 7.0)
4. **Avoid Obstacle:**  (5.0, 10.0) 
5. **Move Towards Breakpoint:** (5.0, 14.0) 
6. **Reach Breakpoint:** (9.0, 16.42) 
7. **Move Towards Goal:** (16.0, 17.0) 
8. **End:** (19.0, 19.0)

This path successfully avoids Obstacle 2, uses the Breakpoint, and reaches the goal set.

## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.

[08/28/2024 03:41:27 PM] new_path = To address the issues with the provided path and ensure it meets all the requirements, we need to focus on avoiding obstacle 1 while incorporating a breakpoint.

### Analysis

1. **Current Path:**
   - The path starts correctly and follows the longest valid subpath to point (9.0, 16.42).
   - The issue arises with the segment from (9.0, 16.42) to (16.0, 17.0), which crosses obstacle 1. 

2. **Obstacle Avoidance:**
   - Obstacle 1 vertices: [[16.6, 20.0], [15.6, 15.9], [15.6, 15.3], [19.9, 14.8]]
   - We can avoid this obstacle by adjusting the path to the left side of the obstacle.

3. **Breakpoint:**
   - The path already passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 16.42) in breakpoint set 1.

### Proposed Solution

We can adjust the path by adding a waypoint before reaching (16.0, 17.0) to go around the obstacle. 

1. **After (9.0, 16.42):** Continue moving upward slightly to (12.0, 16.5) to avoid the obstacle.
2. **Then move horizontally:** Move left to a point like (12.0, 17.0).
3. **Continue to the goal:** Move towards the goal set ensuring the path avoids obstacle 1 and ends within the goal set.

### New Path

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start in the start set
    (5.0, 2.0),
    (5.0, 7.0),
    (5.0, 10.0),
    (5.0, 14.0),
    (9.0, 16.42), # Breakpoint set 1
    (12.0, 16.5), # Adjust to avoid obstacle 1
    (12.0, 17.0), # Further adjustment
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End in the goal set
]
```

This path should adhere to all the requirements, including starting and ending within the designated sets, passing through a breakpoint, and avoiding any obstacles.

[08/28/2024 03:41:36 PM] new_path = Here's how we'll address the provided path and correct it to avoid the intersection with Obstacle 1:

**Thought Process:**

1. **Identify the Problem:**
   - The segment between (12.0, 17.0) and (19.0, 19.0) intersects Obstacle 1, which we need to avoid.

2. **Consider the Valid Subpath:**
   - The longest valid subpath provided is: [(1.0, 1.0), (5.0, 2.0), (5.0, 7.0), (5.0, 10.0), (5.0, 14.0), (9.0, 16.42), (12.0, 16.5), (12.0, 17.0)]

3. **Plan an Alternative Path:**
   - Instead of moving directly from (12.0, 17.0) to (19.0, 19.0), we can adjust the path to avoid Obstacle 1.  

**Proposed Path:**

- We need to circumvent Obstacle 1 by diverting our path slightly. We can do this by approaching the goal set from a direction that avoids the obstacle. 

**New Path:**

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start
    (5.0, 2.0),
    (5.0, 7.0),
    (5.0, 10.0),
    (5.0, 14.0),
    (9.0, 16.42),  # Pass through the first breakpoint
    (12.0, 16.5),
    (12.0, 17.0),
    (12.0, 18.0),  # Move slightly upwards to avoid the obstacle
    (16.0, 18.5),  # Move towards the goal set avoiding the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End in the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

- The new segment (12.0, 17.0) ➔ (12.0, 18.0) ➔ (16.0, 18.5) ensures that the path avoids Obstacle 1 while still maintaining progress towards the goal set.
