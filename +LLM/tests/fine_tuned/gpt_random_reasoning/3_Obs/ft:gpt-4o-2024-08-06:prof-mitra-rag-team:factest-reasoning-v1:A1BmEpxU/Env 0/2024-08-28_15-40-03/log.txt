# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 17.1], [8.2, 10.8], [6.9, 14.8], [2.5, 19.5]]
			Obstacle 2: [[17.1, 17.3], [5.8, 18.9], [5.9, 17.6], [8.0, 16.3]]
			Obstacle 3: [[12.0, 15.2], [18.2, 13.8], [17.8, 19.6], [12.9, 17.9]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 7.2), (9.0, 20.22)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.

    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

[08/28/2024 03:40:08 PM] new_path = Here's a potential path, keeping in mind the constraints and obstacle avoidance. 

**Analysis:**

* The path must start within the start area and end within the goal area.
* It must pass through one of the breakpoints in the set.
* It should avoid crossing any obstacles.

**Path Proposal:**

1. **Start**: (1.0, 1.0) - A point within the start quadrilateral.
2. **Breakpoint 1:** (9.0, 7.2) - Using the first breakpoint.
3. **Intermediate Waypoint:** (10.0, 15.0) - This point helps navigate around the obstacles, staying clear of the corners.
4. **Breakpoint 2 (Optional for your rules):** (9.0, 20.22) - Using the second breakpoint if needed.
5. **End:** (19.0, 19.0) - A point within the goal quadrilateral.

**Path Array:**

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start
    (9.0, 7.2),  # Breakpoint 1
    (10.0, 15.0), # Intermediate waypoint
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End
]
```

**Explanation:**

* The path starts in the start set, passes through a breakpoint, navigates around the obstacles, and ends within the goal set.
* By choosing waypoints carefully, the path avoids crossing any obstacles.

Feel free to adapt the path to suit any additional constraints or preferences.

[08/28/2024 03:40:12 PM] new_path = The provided path intersects with Obstacles 2 and 3. To avoid these obstacles, we need to adjust the path. 

Here's a breakdown of the adjustments:

1. **Initial Segment is Valid:** The path starts at (1.0, 1.0) and goes to (9.0, 7.2), passing through a breakpoint. This segment is valid. 

2. **Avoiding Obstacle 2:**  Instead of going directly to (10.0, 15.0) we can add an intermediate waypoint to circumvent Obstacle 2. A suitable waypoint could be between Obstacle 2 and the previous breakpoint, say (9.0, 14.0).

3. **Final Segment and Obstacle 3:**  From (9.0, 14.0), we can now safely move to (19.0, 19.0) in the goal set, avoiding Obstacle 3.

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 7.2), (9.0, 14.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

[08/28/2024 03:40:20 PM] new_path = To address the issues with the original path and ensure it avoids intersecting obstacles while meeting all requirements, let's analyze and adjust the path:

### Analysis

- **Start:** The path begins correctly within the start set at (1.0, 1.0).
- **Breakpoint:** The path passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 7.2), which is required.
- **Obstacle Intersection:** The problematic segment is from (9.0, 14.0) to (19.0, 19.0), intersecting Obstacles 2 and 3.

### Obstacle Avoidance Strategy

1. **Segment to Breakpoint (9.0, 7.2):** Valid and needs no adjustment.
2. **Next Waypoint (9.0, 14.0):** This segment intersects obstacles. We should alter the path to route around these obstacles.
3. **Further Adjustments:** Move around the problematic areas ensuring the path doesn't hit obstacles.

### Path Adjustments

To avoid the obstacles, we can adjust the segment after the breakpoint by adding waypoints that maneuver around the obstacles.

1. **Add a waypoint after the breakpoint:** Since the breakpoint (9.0, 7.2) is already in a valid position, we can extend a path slightly to circumvent the obstacles:
   - Add (9.0, 10.0) to climb slightly above the obstacle 2.
   - Push the path outward a bit more around the obstacles with a further waypoint before reaching the goal.

### Revised Path

Here’s a plausible adjusted path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),        # Start
    (9.0, 7.2),        # Breakpoint
    (9.0, 10.0),       # Intermediate waypoint to avoid obstacles
    (10.0, 16.0),      # Move around larger obstacle area
    (18.5, 18.5),      # Move towards goal avoiding top corners of obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)       # End in goal set
]
```

This path deliberately avoids the obstacles by changing directions at strategic points to navigate the gaps between them.

[08/28/2024 03:40:28 PM] new_path = To adjust the path and avoid any obstacles while still adhering to the requirements, we need to analyze the problematic segment and find a way to circumvent the obstacles. 

### Analysis

1. **Start:** The path starts correctly within the start set at (1.0, 1.0).
2. **Breakpoint:** The path successfully goes through the breakpoint (9.0, 7.2).
3. **Obstacles:** The segment between (10.0, 16.0) and (18.5, 18.5) intersects with obstacles 2 and 3.

### Adjustments

1. We need to steer the path around obstacles 2 and 3.
2. The previous segment leading up to (10.0, 16.0) is valid, so let's extend from there.

### New Path Proposal

* **Path Extension:** from (10.0, 16.0), we'll divert slightly left and upwards to avoid obstacle 2 and then move towards the goal set:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),       # Start
    (9.0, 7.2),       # Breakpoint 1
    (9.0, 10.0),      # Continue upwards 
    (10.0, 16.0),     # Valid segment end
    (11.0, 19.0),     # Move left and up to avoid obstacles
    (18.0, 20.0),     # Move towards goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)      # End within goal set
]
```

### Explanation

* **(11.0, 19.0):** This point is strategically placed to avoid crossing obstacles 2 and 3.
* **(18.0, 20.0):** This point leads directly towards the goal set, while staying clear of any obstacles.

### Final Path

By following the above waypoint adjustments, a valid path is created that fulfills all of the requirements and avoids any obstacles:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 7.2),
    (9.0, 10.0),

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.

[08/28/2024 03:40:38 PM] new_path = To adjust the path and avoid obstacles, let's review the existing path and the obstacles. We need to ensure that the path avoids collision while starting at the start set, ending at the goal set, and passing through the specified breakpoints.

### Problem Analysis
* **Start Set:** The path correctly starts at (1.0, 1.0).
* **End Set:** The path correctly ends at (18.0, 20.0).
* **Obstacle Collision:** The segment between (10.0, 16.0) and (11.0, 19.0) intersects with Obstacle 2.

### Obstacle Avoidance and Path Adjustment
1. **Valid Subpath:** The valid subpath until the collision is [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 7.2), (9.0, 10.0), (10.0, 16.0)].
2. **Adjusting Path:** To avoid Obstacle 2, we need to reroute the path after (10.0, 16.0).

### New Path Strategy
* After reaching (10.0, 16.0), adjust the path to steer clear of Obstacle 2 by moving around it carefully.
* Use the breakpoint (9.0, 7.2) to navigate better.

### Proposed New Path
1. **Start at (1.0, 1.0):** Within the start set.
2. **Move through (9.0, 7.2):** Pass through the breakpoint.
3. **Continue to (9.0, 10.0):** Move further up.
4. **Reroute below Obstacle 2:**
   - Adjust slightly to avoid the edges of Obstacle 2.
   - Go to (9.5, 15.0).
   - Continue to (10.0, 18.0).
5. **Reach Goal Set:**
   - Move to (18.0, 20.0) within the goal set.

### New Path
```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start
    (9.0, 7.2),   # Breakpoint
    (9.0, 10.0),  # Move upwards
    (9.5, 15.0),  # Adjust around obstacle
    (10.0, 18.0), # Continue upwards
    (18.0, 20.0), # End in goal set
]
```

This path maintains clearance from obstacles, passes through one breakpoint, and fulfills all requirements of starting in the start set and ending in the goal set.

[08/28/2024 03:40:46 PM] new_path = To address the provided feedback and create a path that avoids obstacles while satisfying the path requirements, let's analyze the situation and adjust the path accordingly.

### Analysis

1. **Start and End Points**:
    - The path correctly starts at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start set.
    - The path correctly ends at (18.0, 20.0), which is within the goal set.

2. **Breakpoints**:
    - The path passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 7.2) from the Breakpoint Set 1, which is valid.

3. **Obstacle Intersection**:
    - The feedback highlights a problem with Segment 4, which lies between the waypoints (9.5, 15.0) and (10.0, 18.0), intersecting with Obstacle 2.

4. **Valid Subpath**:
    - The longest valid subpath from the start is [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 7.2), (9.0, 10.0), (9.5, 15.0)].

### Adjustments to the Path

To adjust the path and avoid Obstacle 2, we must find a way to navigate around it without intersecting. Here's the thought process:

1. **Identify Gap**:
    - There is space above and to the right of Obstacle 2 that can be used to navigate the path.

2. **Adjust Path**:
    - We can modify the path to go above and around Obstacle 2 by adding new waypoints.

### New Path

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Start
    (9.0, 7.2),     # Breakpoint 1
    (9.0, 10.0),    # Existing waypoint
    (9.5, 15.0),    # Existing waypoint
    (12.0, 19.0),   # Move above and right to avoid Obstacle 2
    (18.0, 20.0)    # End in the goal set
]
```

### Explanation

- **(12.0, 19.0)**: This waypoint is added to divert the path around Obstacle 2, ensuring that it stays above and to the right of the obstacle.

This new path should successfully navigate through the environment without intersecting any obstacles, satisfying all the problem requirements.
