# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[14.1, 17.2], [10.7, 6.0], [18.4, 10.0], [19.4, 12.6]]
			Obstacle 2: [[5.9, 8.9], [9.9, 1.2], [14.8, 11.3], [13.5, 12.1]]
			Obstacle 3: [[5.6, 9.0], [14.0, 9.4], [15.7, 16.4], [6.5, 12.7]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 0.47), (9.0, 17.85)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate

[08/28/2024 03:47:34 PM] new_path = Here's a path that satisfies the given requirements:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), # start within the start set
    (9.0, 17.85), # pass through the first breakpoint set
    (15.0, 18.0), # move towards the goal area, avoiding obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0) # end within the goal set 
]
```

Let's break down why this path works:

1. **Start and End:** The path begins at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start set quadrilateral, and ends at (19.0, 19.0), clearly within the goal set quadrilateral.

2. **Breakpoints:** The path passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 17.85) from the given set, satisfying the requirement to pass through one breakpoint from each set.

3. **Obstacle Avoidance:** The path is carefully crafted to avoid crossing any of the three obstacles. Here's a brief explanation of how:

    * From the start point (1.0, 1.0), it moves upwards to (9.0, 17.85), staying clear of obstacles 1 and 2.
    * From (9.0, 17.85), it moves rightwards to (15.0, 18.0), staying above obstacle 3 and avoiding the top of obstacle 1.
    * Finally, it moves to (19.0, 19.0) within the goal set, avoiding any collision.

4. **Linear Segments:** The path consists of straight line segments connecting the waypoints: (1.0, 1.0) to (9.0, 17.85), (9.0, 17.85) to (15.0, 18.0), and (15.0, 18.0) to (19.0, 19.0). These segments are all linear and do not cross any obstacles.

Keep in mind that this is just one possible solution. Depending on the specific problem constraints and preferences, there may be other valid paths that also satisfy all the requirements.

[08/28/2024 03:47:43 PM] new_path = ### Analysis and Adjustments

To fix the path, we need to ensure it doesn't intersect with Obstacle 3 and passes through a breakpoint.

1. **Current Path Review:**
   * The path starts at (1.0, 1.0) and immediately collides with Obstacle 3 when moving to (9.0, 17.85).
   * The valid subpath is just the starting point (1.0, 1.0).

2. **Obstacle Relationship:**
   * Obstacle 3 has vertices at [[5.6, 9.0], [14.0, 9.4], [15.7, 16.4], [6.5, 12.7]]. Our path needs to navigate around these coordinates.

3. **Breakpoint Utilization:**
   * We have a breakpoint at (9.0, 17.85) which is being used, but the path to reach it is invalid. We need to find a new path that connects through this or another breakpoint while avoiding Obstacle 3.

4. **Revised Path Strategy:**
   * Start the path inside the start set at a point not obstructed by the obstacles.
   * Navigate around Obstacle 3 by adding waypoints that steer clear of its vertices.
   * Ensure to pass through the breakpoint, and then continue towards the goal set while avoiding other obstacles.

### New Path Proposal

Given the information, a possible path could look like:

1. **Start Point:** (1.0, 1.0) - within the start set.
2. **Waypoint 1:** (1.0, 5.0) - Move vertically up to avoid Obstacle 3.
3. **Waypoint 2:** (6.0, 5.0) - Move horizontally towards the right, staying clear of Obstacle 3.
4. **Waypoint 3:** (9.0, 17.85) - Pass through the breakpoint.
5. **Waypoint 4:** (15.0, 17.0) - Navigate towards the goal while staying clear of obstacle regions.
6. **End Point:** (19.0, 19.0) - Inside the goal set.

### Revised Path

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (1.0, 5.0),
    (6.0, 5.0),
    (9.0, 17.85),
    (15.0, 17.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This path attempts to safely navigate around Obstacle 3 while adhering to the breakpoint and reaching the goal set without further collisions.

[08/28/2024 03:47:52 PM] new_path = Here's the analysis and the adjusted path:

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Initial Path Issue:** The segment connecting (6.0, 5.0) to (9.0, 17.85) crosses obstacles 2 and 3.
2. **Valid Subpath:** The segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (6.0, 5.0) is valid.
3. **Obstacle Analysis:**
   - **Obstacle 2:** Stretches from a low point (9.9, 1.2) to a higher point (14.8, 11.3). 
   - **Obstacle 3:** Extends from (5.6, 9.0) to (14.0, 9.4), creating a challenging passage between the two obstacles.
4. **Goal:** Find a path around these obstacles while still reaching the breakpoint (9.0, 17.85).

**New Path:**

1. **Start:** (1.0, 1.0)
2. **Proceed North:** Move up to avoid the lower parts of obstacles, reaching a safe waypoint at (1.0, 12.0).
3. **Eastward Advance:** Move east to bypass obstacle 3, arriving at (10.0, 12.0).
4. **Waypoint Addition:** From (10.0, 12.0), move further east to create a path around the upper edge of obstacle 2, reaching (14.0, 14.0).
5. **Reach Breakpoint:** Move north to the required breakpoint (9.0, 17.85).
6. **Goal Entry:** Continue to the final waypoint within the goal set, (19.0, 19.0).

**New Path Array:**

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (1.0, 12.0),
    (10.0, 12.0),
    (14.0, 14.0),
    (9.0, 17.85), 
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

**Key Adjustments:**

- **Adjusted existing points** to circumvent obstacles.
- **Added new waypoints** (10.0, 12.0) and (14.0, 14.0) to guide the path safely between the obstacles and towards the breakpoint.
- **Maintained the requirement** that the path passes through the given breakpoint. 

This new path avoids crossing any obstacles and still meets all the original requirements.

    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

[08/28/2024 03:47:59 PM] new_path = To adjust the path and avoid the obstacles while still meeting the requirements, let's analyze the current path and make necessary changes:

### Current Path
1. **Start:** (1.0, 1.0)
2. (1.0, 12.0)
3. (10.0, 12.0)
4. (14.0, 14.0)
5. **Breakpoint:** (9.0, 17.85)
6. **End:** (19.0, 19.0)

### Issue
The segment between (1.0, 12.0) and (10.0, 12.0) intersects with Obstacle 3.

### Solution
To bypass Obstacle 3, we need to adjust the path around it. We can use the longest valid subpath from the start and add new waypoints:

1. **Use the Valid Subpath:** (1.0, 1.0) to (1.0, 12.0).
2. **Avoid Obstacle 3:** Move up and around it. Add a waypoint to go above Obstacle 3.
3. **Reach the Breakpoint:** Then head towards the breakpoint (9.0, 17.85).
4. **Proceed to Goal:** Finally, move from the breakpoint to the goal set.

### Adjusted Path
Here's the new path considering the adjustments:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start
    (1.0, 12.0),  # Continue upwards
    (3.0, 14.0),  # Move slightly right and up to avoid Obstacle 3
    (9.0, 17.85), # Reach the breakpoint
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End in the goal set
]
```

This new path ensures:

- **Start and End:** It begins in the start set and ends in the goal set.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** It avoids all obstacles by going around Obstacle 3.
- **Breakpoint:** It passes through the provided breakpoint.
- **Linear Segments:** The path segments do not cross any obstacles.
