# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[13.9, 6.0], [16.8, 7.1], [16.4, 16.0], [14.1, 11.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[19.7, 17.5], [17.2, 17.5], [18.2, 17.3], [19.3, 17.3]]
			Obstacle 3: [[10.7, 8.3], [16.3, 0.8], [17.5, 12.2], [16.4, 14.6]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 10.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/28/2024 03:52:47 PM] new_path = To create a path from the given start set to the goal set while avoiding obstacles and passing through the breakpoints, we can follow this plan:

### Analysis:
1. **Start Set:** Choose a starting point within the quadrilateral defined by the vertices \((2.0, 2.0), (-0.0, 2.0), (-0.0, -0.0), (2.0, -0.0))\).
2. **Goal Set:** The endpoint should be within the quadrilateral defined by the vertices \((20.0, 20.0), (18.0, 20.0), (18.0, 18.0), (20.0, 18.0))\).
3. **Obstacles:** Identify obstacles within the area and plan a path that maintains a safe distance from them.
4. **Breakpoints:** Ensure the path passes through the breakpoint \((9.0, 10.0)\).

### Path Planning:
1. **Start:** Choose the starting point at \((1.0, 1.0)\) within the start set.
2. **Waypoint 1:** Move towards the breakpoint \((9.0, 10.0)\). This keeps us clear of the obstacles.
3. **Waypoint 2:** Navigate further to the right and upwards while avoiding the obstacles towards the goal set.
4. **Goal:** Choose a point \((19.0, 19.0)\) within the goal set to conclude the path.

### New Path:
The waypoints chosen create a safe, non-intersecting path from the start to the goal:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start 
    (5.0, 6.0),  # Waypoint 1, avoid obstacles
    (9.0, 10.0), # Breakpoint 
    (14.0, 15.0),# Waypoint 2, avoid obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0) # End within the goal set
]
```

### Verification:
1. **Start and End:** The path starts and ends inside the respective sets.
2. **Breakpoints:** The path passes through the breakpoint \((9.0, 10.0)\).
3. **Obstacle Avoidance:** By selecting waypoints wisely, the path avoids colliding with any obstacles. 

This path efficiently meets the outlined requirements.
