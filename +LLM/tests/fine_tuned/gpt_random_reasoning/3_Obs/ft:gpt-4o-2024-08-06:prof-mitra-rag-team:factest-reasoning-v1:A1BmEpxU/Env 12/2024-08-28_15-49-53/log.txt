# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.1, 13.0], [17.5, 10.6], [17.5, 19.3], [15.5, 17.6]]
			Obstacle 2: [[18.2, 12.2], [7.8, 10.0], [9.3, 4.6], [15.3, 1.7]]
			Obstacle 3: [[4.9, 10.3], [11.8, 9.6], [13.7, 19.3], [7.6, 19.1]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 1.84), (9.0, 20.57)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

[08/28/2024 03:50:01 PM] new_path = To create a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, passes through a breakpoint from each set, and avoids the obstacles, we can choose the following waypoints:

1. **Start Point:** Choose any point inside the start quadrilateral. For instance, (1.0, 1.0).

2. **Breakpoint 1:** Select a breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1. Let's choose (9.0, 1.84).

3. **Intermediate Points:** Carefully select waypoints that navigate around the obstacles without intersecting them.

4. **Goal Point:** Choose a point within the goal quadrilateral. For instance, (19.0, 19.0).

### Path Plan
- **(1.0, 1.0):** Start point within the start set.
- **(9.0, 1.84):** Move to the breakpoint.
- **(12.0, 5.0):** Navigate around Obstacle 3.
- **(16.0, 17.0):** Navigate between Obstacles 2 and 3.
- **(19.0, 19.0):** End point within the goal set.

### Path Array
```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 1.84),
    (12.0, 5.0),
    (16.0, 17.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

### Explanation
- The path starts inside the start quadrilateral.
- It passes through a breakpoint from the provided set.
- The selected waypoints ensure the path avoids all obstacles, maintaining a safe distance.
- The path finally ends within the goal quadrilateral.

[08/28/2024 03:50:09 PM] new_path = The issue is that the second segment of the path from (9.0, 1.84) to (12.0, 5.0) intersects with Obstacle 2. To fix this, we need to find a way to avoid this obstacle while maintaining the breakpoints and reaching the goal. 

Here's a possible solution:

1. **Start at (1.0, 1.0):** This is within the start set and gives us a good starting point.
2. **Move to (9.0, 1.84):** This is our first breakpoint that we need to include in the path. 
3. **Avoid Obstacle 2:**  Instead of going directly to (12.0, 5.0), we can move around Obstacle 2 by taking the following path: 
   - Move to (9.0, 10.0): This is a point above Obstacle 2 that avoids any intersection. 
   - Move to (12.0, 10.0): This keeps us clear of Obstacle 2 while bringing us closer to the goal.
4. **Move to (16.0, 17.0):** This point is above both Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3, allowing us to move towards the goal set.
5. **End at (19.0, 19.0):** This is within the goal set.

[08/28/2024 03:50:18 PM] new_path = Let's analyze the provided path and identify the necessary adjustments to avoid obstacles and ensure a valid trajectory:

### Initial Analysis

1. **Start and End Points**: The path starts at (1.0, 1.0) within the start set and ends at (19.0, 19.0) within the goal set. These points are correct.

2. **Segments and Obstacle Intersections**:
   - The feedback identifies that the segment between the waypoints (9.0, 1.84) and (9.0, 10.0) intersects with Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3. This makes this segment invalid.

3. **Longest Valid Subpath**: The longest valid segment from the start is [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 1.84)].

### Adjustments Needed

1. **Segment Avoidance**: We need to adjust the path starting from (9.0, 1.84) to avoid obstacles 2 and 3.

2. **Path to Breakpoints**: The path must pass through one of the breakpoints of each set. The initial path already goes through (9.0, 1.84), which is in Breakpoint Set 1.

3. **Spatial Exploration**:
   - From (9.0, 1.84), instead of going straight up (which intersects with obstacles), consider a path that moves rightward and then up to circumvent the obstacles.

### Suggested Path Adjustments

1. **Re-route Around Obstacles**:
   - Adjust the path at (9.0, 1.84) to move rightward towards a clear space between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3.
   - Add a waypoint to navigate around the boundaries of the obstacles.

2. **Ensure Goal Set Reached**:
   - Carefully navigate the path to avoid all obstacles and reach the goal set.

### New Path Plan

Here's a proposed new path:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start in the start set
    (9.0, 1.84),     # Pass through the breakpoint in set 1
    (14.0, 1.84),    # Move rightward to a point clear of obstacle intersection
    (14.0, 17.0),    # Move upward avoiding obstacles 3 
    (19.0, 19.0)     # End in the goal set
]
```

This path attempts to avoid intersecting any of the obstacles while satisfying all provided requirements. Please verify it graphically or through simulation to ensure its correctness in your specific environment.

[08/28/2024 03:50:26 PM] new_path = To adjust the path and avoid the obstacles, let's analyze the current path and identify where changes are needed.

### Analysis

1. **Initial Path:** The path starts at (1.0, 1.0) and aims to reach (19.0, 19.0), passing through a breakpoint at (9.0, 1.84).
2. **Problematic Segment:** The segment between (14.0, 1.84) and (14.0, 17.0) intersects with Obstacle 2.

### Adjustments

1. **Valid Subpath:** The longest valid subpath is from (1.0, 1.0) to (14.0, 1.84). We will adjust from this point.
2. **Bypass Obstacle 2:**  We need to bypass Obstacle 2. Instead of moving directly upwards from (14.0, 1.84), we should move horizontally away, then upwards.
3. **Select a Different Endpoint:** Navigate around the obstacle and choose an endpoint within the goal set that is safe from obstacles.

### New Path

1. **Start at (1.0, 1.0):** Within the start set.
2. **Move to (9.0, 1.84):**  Pass through the required breakpoint.
3. **Move to (14.0, 1.84):** Continue horizontally.
4. **Move to (14.0, 5.0):** Shift slightly up to avoid obstacles.
5. **Move to (17.0, 5.0):** Move horizontally towards the goal set avoiding obstacles.
6. **Move to (19.0, 19.0):** Reach the goal set.

### New Path Proposal

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 1.84),
    (14.0, 1.84),
    (14.0, 5.0),
    (17.0, 5.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This path avoids the obstacles by going around Obstacle 2, passing a breakpoint, and reaching the goal set.

[08/28/2024 03:50:33 PM] new_path = To address the issue with the original path and create a valid path that avoids obstacles, let's analyze the situation and adjust the path accordingly.

**Current Issue:**

The segment between (14.0, 1.84) and (14.0, 5.0) intersects with Obstacle 2.

**Steps to Correct:**

1. **Understand the Obstacle:** Obstacle 2 has a vertex at (9.3, 4.6). The path segment in question passes close to this vertex, causing the intersection.

2. **Avoid the Obstacle:** To bypass this obstacle, we can create a waypoint that goes below the obstacle's lowest point in the y-direction.

3. **Adjust the Path:**

   - Start from the valid subpath: [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 1.84), (14.0, 1.84)]
   - Add a waypoint below Obstacle 2 at the x-coordinate of the previous waypoint: (14.0, 0.0)
   - Proceed to ensure that the path stays clear of obstacles while maintaining the goal of ending in the target set.

**New Path:**

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),      # Start inside the start set
    (9.0, 1.84),     # Pass through the breakpoint
    (14.0, 1.84),    # Maintain position to avoid collision
    (14.0, 0.0),     # Move below Obstacle 2
    (16.0, 0.0),     # Move right
    (16.0, 18.0),    # Move up to reach goal region
    (19.0, 19.0)     # End inside the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

- The new path utilizes the breakpoint and then goes below the obstacle's lowest y-point, avoiding collision.
- The path then proceeds in the x-direction, then finally upwards to the goal set, ensuring no further intersections with obstacles.

This path should now meet all requirements, including avoiding each obstacle while passing through the designated breakpoint and reaching the goal set.

### Analysis

1. **Current Path:** 
   - The path starts correctly in the start set and ends in the goal set.
   - The issue arises with Segment 5, which goes from (16.0, 0.0) to (16.0, 18.0), intersecting both Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2.

2. **Obstacle Locations:**
   - **Obstacle 1:** Upper right of the segment
   - **Obstacle 2:** Upper right and part of the lower region around (16.0, 0.0)

3. **Valid Subpath:**
   - The path up to (16.0, 0.0) is valid and avoids obstacles.

### Adjustments

1. **Avoiding Obstacle 2:**
   - After reaching (16.0, 0.0), the path needs to navigate around Obstacle 2.
   - Instead of moving straight up, navigate horizontally then vertically to avoid Obstacle 2.

2. **Avoiding Obstacle 1:**
   - After bypassing Obstacle 2, move vertically and slightly adjust to enter the goal set, avoiding Obstacle 1.

### New Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start
    (9.0, 1.84),  # Through Breakpoint
    (14.0, 1.84),
    (14.0, 0.0),
    (16.0, 0.0),  # End of valid subpath
    (18.0, 0.0),  # Move right to avoid Obstacle 2
    (18.0, 18.0),  # Move up to goal level, avoiding Obstacle 1
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End in goal set
]
```

### Explanation

- **(18.0, 0.0):** This waypoint moves the path to the right, bypassing Obstacle 2.
- **(18.0, 18.0):** Moving up to the goal set’s level, making sure not to cross Obstacle 1.
- **(19.0, 19.0):** Final waypoint in the goal set.

This new path should satisfy all the requirements while ensuring no intersections with any obstacles.
