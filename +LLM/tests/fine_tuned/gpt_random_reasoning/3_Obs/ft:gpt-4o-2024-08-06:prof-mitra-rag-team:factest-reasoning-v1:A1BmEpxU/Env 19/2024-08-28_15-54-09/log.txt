# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[10.3, 15.5], [15.0, 10.5], [19.1, 15.1], [15.1, 16.2]]
			Obstacle 2: [[4.0, 18.1], [10.2, 16.6], [13.3, 18.7], [12.7, 19.7]]
			Obstacle 3: [[14.3, 14.9], [6.2, 6.6], [8.9, 5.2], [9.7, 5.1]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 1.59), (9.0, 13.18), (9.0, 20.51)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.

    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[08/28/2024 03:54:16 PM] new_path = Here's a possible path considering the provided constraints and the example:

**Path Planning:**

1. **Start Point:** Choose a starting point within the start set, for example, (1.0, 1.0).
2. **Breakpoint 1:** Choose a breakpoint from the set, e.g., (9.0, 1.59).
3. **Navigate Around Obstacles:**

   - The path needs to avoid Obstacle 1.  Navigate around it by moving up or down. Since Obstacle 2 is also above the start point, navigating below might be clearer.

4. **Move towards the goal:**

   - After passing Breakpoint 1 and Obstacles, head towards the goal.
   
5. **End Point:** Choose an ending point within the goal set, for example (19.0, 19.0).

**Path Array:**

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),        # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 1.59),       # Pass through the breakpoint
    (9.0, 14.0),       # Move upwards, avoiding obstacles
    (15.0, 18.0),      # Move towards the goal while avoiding obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)       # End within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

- The path starts from a point within the start set.
- It then passes through a chosen breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1.
- The path navigates around the obstacles by moving upwards.
- The final segment directs the path towards the goal set, avoiding all obstacles, and ends within the goal set. 

This is one of many possible solutions, and careful analysis of the obstacle positions and required waypoints is crucial to ensure a collision-free path.

[08/28/2024 03:54:24 PM] new_path = Here's a breakdown of what happened and how to fix it:

**Problem:**

Your current path starts at a valid point and passes through a correct breakpoint, but then collides with Obstacle 3 on its way up to its next waypoint. 

**Spatial Analysis:**

1. **Obstacle Location:** Obstacle 3 extends from around (6.2, 6.6) to (14.3, 14.9).
2. **Path Collision:** The path segment from (9.0, 1.59) to (9.0, 14.0) intersects this obstacle.

**Solution:**

1. **Reroute:** Instead of going straight up, we need to avoid the obstacle by moving horizontally out of its way first.
2. **Detour:** 
    - Move slightly to the right to clear the obstacle completely. Use (9.5, 1.59) as a waypoint to shift the path.
    - Then, move up safely avoiding the obstacle, perhaps to somewhere like (9.5, 16.0). 
    - Finally, proceed to (15.0, 18.0) and then (19.0, 19.0) to reach the goal set.

**Adjusted Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 1.59),
    (9.5, 1.59),  # Moving right slightly to avoid Obstacle 3
    (9.5, 16.0),  # Moving up after clearing the obstacle
    (15.0, 18.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)  # Reaching the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

By adding the new waypoint (9.5, 1.59) and (9.5, 16.0), we navigate around Obstacle 3, ensuring the path no longer intersects any obstacles while still adhering to the problem's constraints.

[08/28/2024 03:54:32 PM] new_path = ## Analysis and Adjustment

The path you provided has a segment that intersects with Obstacle 3. Let’s analyze and adjust the path to avoid this obstacle.

### Current Valid Path
- The path starts at (1.0, 1.0) and passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 1.59), which is valid.
- The next segment goes to (9.5, 1.59), which is also valid as it doesn't cross any obstacles.

### Problematic Segment
- The segment from (9.5, 1.59) to (9.5, 16.0) crosses Obstacle 3.

### Obstacle Avoidance Strategy
We need to redirect the path to avoid Obstacle 3 while maintaining the path's entry into the goal set.

### New Pathway Proposal

1. **Start from current breakpoint:** Continue from (9.5, 1.59).
2. **Navigate around Obstacle 3:** Move slightly right, then upward along a path that avoids Obstacle 3.
3. **Reach the goal set safely:** Navigate toward the goal set's center without crossing other obstacles.

### New Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),        # Start point in the start set
    (9.0, 1.59),       # Breakpoint 1
    (9.5, 1.59),       # Continue forward
    (10.0, 1.59),      # Move right to avoid Obstacle 3
    (10.0, 15.0),      # Move upward
    (14.0, 17.0),      # Diagonal move toward goal
    (19.0, 19.0)       # End in the goal set
]
```

### Explanation

- **Rights and Upward Moves:** These shifts ensure that we avoid the corners of Obstacle 3.
- **Diagonal Approach to Goal:** This allows safe entry into the goal set without encountering the obstacles around the path.

### Final Check

This path should now meet all requirements:
- **Start and End:** Correctly starts and ends in the specified sets.
- **Obstacles:** Avoids all obstacles.
- **Breakpoints:** Passes through Breakpoint 1.

By adjusting the path with careful waypoint placement, we successfully navigate around the obstacles and achieve the task's goals.

[08/28/2024 03:54:39 PM] new_path = Here's how I would adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacle 3:

**1. Identify the problematic segment:**
   The segment between (10.0, 1.59) and (10.0, 15.0) intersects with obstacle 3.

**2. Analyze the obstacle and segment:**
   Obstacle 3 is to the left of the problematic segment. Therefore, we need to route the path to the right of the obstacle.

**3. Plan the detour:**
   We can add a waypoint that moves the path slightly to the right, avoiding the obstacle while maintaining a safe distance.  

**4. Suggested new path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),       # Start in the start set
    (9.0, 1.59),     # First breakpoint
    (9.5, 1.59),    
    (10.0, 1.59),
    (12.0, 1.59),    # Move slightly right to avoid obstacle 3
    (12.0, 15.0),    # Move upwards, now clear of obstacle 3
    (14.0, 17.0),   
    (19.0, 19.0)    # End in the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

By adding the waypoint (12.0, 1.59) after (10.0, 1.59), we shift the path slightly to the right, avoiding a collision with obstacle 3. We then continue on a straight path upwards to (12.0, 15.0) before proceeding to the goal set.

**Note:** This path still uses the same initial start and goal points, as well as the breakpoint from set 1 (9.0, 1.59).

    To correct the path and avoid the obstacles, let's analyze the problematic segment and make adjustments.

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Identify Problematic Segment:**
   * The segment from (12.0, 1.59) to (12.0, 15.0) intersects with Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3.
   
2. **Spatial Relationships:**
   * Obstacle 1 is to the upper left of this segment, and Obstacle 3 is below it.
   * We need to route the path around these obstacles.

3. **Adjusting the Path:**
   * The longest valid subpath is [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 1.59), (9.5, 1.59), (10.0, 1.59), (12.0, 1.59)].
   * From (12.0, 1.59), we can add a waypoint to move right around Obstacle 3, then carefully move upwards to avoid both obstacles.

**Obstacle Avoidance and Path Adjustments:**

* **New Waypoints:**
  * (12.5, 1.59): Move slightly right from (12.0, 1.59) to avoid Obstacle 3.
  * (16.0, 10.0): Move diagonally upwards to pass between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3.
  * (18.0, 18.0): Move further up to reach the goal area safely.  

**Final Path:**

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),       # Start
    (9.0, 1.59),      # Breakpoint
    (9.5, 1.59),
    (10.0, 1.59),
    (12.0, 1.59),
    (12.5, 1.59),     # Avoid Obstacle 3

    (18.0, 18.0),     # End in goal set
    (19.0, 19.0)      # Final point in goal

[08/28/2024 03:55:01 PM] new_path = To address the feedback and create a valid path, let's rethink the strategy considering the spatial relationships with obstacles and the breakpoints.

### Initial Considerations
1. **Start Set**: We need to ensure our path originates within [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]].
2. **Obstacles**: The path needs to circumvent the obstacle regions defined.
3. **Breakpoints**: We must incorporate at least one breakpoint from the set [(9.0, 1.59), (9.0, 13.18), (9.0, 20.51)] while moving towards the goal.
4. **Goal Set**: The path should conclude within the goal set [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]].

### Path Adjustment Plan

1. **Choose a Start Point**: Start near the bottom-left corner to strategically navigate upwards using the breakpoints while avoiding obstacles.

2. **Integrate Breakpoints**: Move towards a breakpoint that helps plot a path around obstacles.

3. **Obstacle Avoidance Strategy**: 
   - Use waypoints that navigate around obstacle edges.
   - Maintain clearances to avoid intersection with obstacles.

4. **Move Towards Goal**: Ensure the path smoothly transitions towards the goal set without backtracking or intersecting obstacles.

### New Path Proposal

    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start within the start set
    (3.0, 1.0),   # Move horizontally while keeping clear of obstacles
    (3.0, 13.0),  # Move upwards towards a breakpoint while circumventing obstacles
    (9.0, 13.18), # Pass through a selected breakpoint
    (15.0, 13.0), # Continue horizontally, avoiding obstacles
    (18.5, 18.0), # Use a safe vertical segment to approach the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End within the goal set
]
```

### Explanation

- The path starts at (1.0, 1.0), well within the start set.
- By progressing horizontally to (3.0, 1.0), the path remains safe from obstacles.
- Vertical movement to (3.0, 13.0) positions the path to intersect a breakpoint.
- Using the breakpoint (9.0, 13.18), the path integrates a required element for validation.
- Strategic horizontal and vertical adjustments via (15.0, 13.0) and (18.5, 18.0) circumvent obstacles without overlap.
- The path concludes at (19.0, 19.0), securely within the goal set.

This path effectively addresses the feedback, ensuring a legitimate start and end, breakpoint integration, and successful obstacle avoidance.
