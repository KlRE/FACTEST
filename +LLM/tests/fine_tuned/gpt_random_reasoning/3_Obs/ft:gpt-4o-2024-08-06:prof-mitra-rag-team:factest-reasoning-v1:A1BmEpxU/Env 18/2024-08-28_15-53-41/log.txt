# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[17.8, 19.0], [15.7, 17.9], [17.5, 15.7], [18.1, 16.4]]
			Obstacle 2: [[19.3, 6.1], [17.4, 11.1], [17.5, 7.2], [19.2, 5.4]]
			Obstacle 3: [[18.1, 16.2], [7.6, 18.4], [8.3, 16.1], [8.9, 15.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 6.5), (9.0, 20.05)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

[08/28/2024 03:53:47 PM] new_path = Here's a possible path that meets the requirements:

**Path Analysis**

1. **Start to Breakpoint 1:** 
   - Start at the midpoint of the bottom edge of the start quadrilateral \((1.0, 0.0)\).
   - Move upwards, passing through the first breakpoint \((9.0, 6.5)\).

2. **Breakpoint 1 to Breakpoint 2:**
   - Move upwards and slightly to the right to avoid Obstacle 1, reaching a point like \((10.0, 16.0)\).
   - Continue upwards to the second breakpoint \((9.0, 20.05)\).

3. **Breakpoint 2 to Goal:**
   - Move rightwards, staying above all obstacles, and then down to reach the goal quadrilateral, ending at a point like \((19.0, 19.0)\).

**Path Array:**

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 0.0),  # Start
    (9.0, 6.5),  # Breakpoint 1
    (10.0, 16.0),  # Avoid Obstacle 1
    (9.0, 20.05),  # Breakpoint 2
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End in the goal set
]
```

**Obstacle Avoidance**

The path avoids all obstacles by staying clear of their boundaries. It uses the breakpoints as waypoints and connects them in a way that circumvents the obstacles.

The path is a rough estimation. Adjustments to the waypoints might be necessary to ensure the path doesn't get too close to any obstacles, depending on more precise obstacle placements and sizes.

[08/28/2024 03:53:59 PM] new_path = The problem lies in the second segment of the path, which crosses over Obstacle 3. To fix this, we need to adjust the path to navigate around this obstacle.  

Here&#39;s a breakdown of the thought process:

1. **Identify the issue:** The segment connecting (9.0, 6.5) and (10.0, 18.5) intersects Obstacle 3. 
2. **Analyze Obstacle 3:**  Obstacle 3 is positioned between the start set and the goal set. To avoid it, our path should either go above, below, or around it.
3. **Adjust the path:**  We can modify the path to go around Obstacle 3 by adding a waypoint that bypasses it from the right side. We want to keep a safe distance from the obstacle.
4. **Ensure Breakpoints:** The path already includes the required breakpoint (9.0, 6.5), so we don&#39;t need to worry about that.

Here&#39;s the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 0.0),             # Start point
    (9.0, 6.5),             # Breakpoint 1
    (15.0, 10.0),           # New waypoint to go around Obstacle 3
    (19.0, 19.0)            # End point in the goal set
]
```

This new path:

* Starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
* Passes through the required breakpoint.
* Avoids crossing any obstacles. The new waypoint (15.0, 10.0) ensures the path doesn&#39;t intersect with Obstacle 3.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

1. **Initial Analysis:**

   The path provided starts correctly within the start set and ends in the goal set. However, the third segment between points (15.0, 10.0) and (19.0, 19.0) intersects with obstacles 1 and 3.

2. **Valid Subpath:**

   The valid subpath provided is [(1.0, 0.0), (9.0, 6.5), (15.0, 10.0)]. This means the path is clear up to (15.0, 10.0), a point where we must diverge to avoid the obstacles.

3. **Obstacle Locations:**

   - **Obstacle 1:** Located close to the top-right section of the path.
   - **Obstacle 3:** Intersects the path between the second and third segments.

4. **Avoidance Strategy:**

   - Use the breakpoint (9.0, 6.5) effectively.
   - To bypass the obstacles while heading towards the goal, we can route our path further to the right before heading upwards, avoiding both obstacles.

### New Path Proposal

We'll modify the path after the valid subpath to circumvent the obstacles:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 0.0),         # Start
    (9.0, 6.5),         # Breakpoint 1, valid
    (15.0, 10.0),       # Valid waypoint
    (16.0, 9.5),        # New waypoint, moving slightly down and right to avoid obstacles
    (19.5, 14.0),       # Waypoint further up and to the right, clear of obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)        # End in the goal set
]
```

### Explanation:

- By introducing the waypoints (16.0, 9.5) and (19.5, 14.0), we create a more indirect route that safely avoids obstacles 1 and 3.
- The path maintains its requirement to pass through the provided breakpoint, and all segments between waypoints avoid any obstacle intersection.

This path should satisfy all given requirements and avoid obstacles while starting from the start set and ending in the goal set.
