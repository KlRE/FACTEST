# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]

		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 5.33), (9.0, 18.32)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.

[08/28/2024 03:42:36 PM] new_path = Here's a potential path that starts within the start set, ends in the goal set, avoids obstacles, and passes through a breakpoint:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 5.33), # Pass through Breakpoint Set 1
    (12.0, 13.0), # Navigate around obstacles 1 and 3
    (19.0, 9.0),  # Navigate around obstacle 2
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End within the goal set
]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Start:** The path begins at (1.0, 1.0) inside the start quadrilateral.

2. **Breakpoint 1:** The path moves towards (9.0, 5.33) to pass through the breakpoint set 1.

3. **Obstacle Avoidance:**
   -The path navigates upwards to (12.0, 13.0) to avoid obstacles 1 and 3. 
   - It then moves right to (19.0, 9.0) to circumvent obstacle 2.

4. **End:** Finally, the path ends at (19.0, 19.0) within the goal quadrilateral.

This path satisfies all the requirements and avoids any intersection with the obstacles.

[08/28/2024 03:42:46 PM] new_path = Here’s a breakdown of the path planning process, addressing the obstacles and ensuring compliance with the constraints. 

### Current Path
The provided path is:
* [(1.0, 1.0, (9.0, 5.33), (12.0, 13.0), (19.0, 9.0), (19.0, 19.0))] 

***Issue Identification:*** The segment connecting (9.0, 5.33) and (12.0, 13.0) intersects with Obstacle 3, specifically with the edge connecting vertices (6.8, 14.2) and (16.3, 10.7). 

### Path Adjustment Strategy
1. **Utilize Valid Segment:** The segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (9.0, 5.33) is valid and will be retained.
2. **Avoid Obstacle 3:** The problematic segment must be adjusted. A path around Obstacle 3 is possible by following these steps:
    * **Add a Waypoint:** Incorporate an intermediate waypoint to circumvent the obstacle.
    * **Path Construction:** Plan a path utilizing the breakpoints to move strategically from the valid segment to the goal.

### Spatial Relationship Analysis
* **Obstacle 3 Positioning:** Located between the start and goal areas with vertices encroaching towards the center.
* **Utilize Free Space:** The space above Obstacle 3 can be utilized to avoid intersections.

### Revised Path Proposal
A path circumventing Obstacle 3 and reaching the target is proposed as follows:

```plaintext
new_path = [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 5.33), (10.0, 7.0), (10.0, 15.0), (19.0, 19.0)]
```

### Explanation
1. **Initial Segment:** Start at (1.0, 1.0) and proceed to (9.0, 5.33), the first breakpoint.
2. **Circumvent Obstacle:** Navigate around Obstacle 3:
   * **Intermediate Waypoint (10.0, 7.0):** This waypoint shifts the path upwards, avoiding the lower right vertex of Obstacle 3.
   * **Maintain Safe Distance:** Continue to (10.0, 15.0), keeping clear of all points on Obstacle 3. 
3. **Final Approach:** From (10.0, 15.0), proceed directly to (19.0, 19.0), concluding within the goal set.

### Conclusion
This adjusted path aligns with spatial constraints:
* **No Obstacle Intersections:** All segments clear Obstacle 3.
* **Breakpoint Usage:** The path passes through a breakpoint, satisfying this condition.
* **Valid Start and End:** The path initiates within the start area and concludes in the goal region.

Through careful waypoint selection and maintenance of a safe distance from obstacles, a viable path to the goal is achieved.

[08/28/2024 03:42:57 PM] new_path = To address the feedback regarding the path colliding with obstacles, let's analyze the spatial relationships and adjust the path accordingly.

### Analysis

1. **Current Path:**
   - The path starts at (1.0, 1.0), goes through (9.0, 5.33), (10.0, 7.0), and ends at (19.0, 19.0).

2. **Identified Issues:**
   - The segment connecting (10.0, 7.0) to (10.0, 15.0) crosses both Obstacles 1 and 3.

3. **Valid Subpath:**
   - The longest valid part of the path from the start is [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 5.33), (10.0, 7.0)].

### Adjustments for Obstacle Avoidance

1. **Obstacle Analysis:**
   - **Obstacle 1:** Defined by points [[1.6, 10.8], [14.3, 14.0], [7.3, 14.8], [3.6, 12.7]]
   - **Obstacle 3:** Defined by points [[6.2, 13.5], [16.3, 10.7], [19.1, 16.7], [6.8, 14.2]]

2. **Adjustment Strategy:**
   - Instead of going vertically from (10.0, 7.0), adjust the path to go around the obstacles.
   - Navigate around Obstacle 1 and 3 by using waypoints that avoid their boundaries.

### New Path with Adjusted Waypoints

1. **Continued from Valid Subpath:**
   - Start at (1.0, 1.0), go through (9.0, 5.33), (10.0, 7.0).

2. **Avoid Obstacles:**
   - First detour around Obstacle 1 and approach the goal from a different angle:
     - Add a waypoint around Obstacle 1's top-right corner and below Obstacle 3's lowest point.

3. **Final Path:**
   - Use waypoints that ensure no intersection with obstacles and maintain a safe distance.

### New Path Proposal

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),       # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 5.33),      # Pass through the breakpoint in Set 1
    (10.0, 7.0), 
    (15.0, 9.0),      # Go around Obstacle 1's top-right
    (17.0, 17.0),     # Approach a point safely over Obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0)      # End within the goal set
]
```

This path avoids obstacles by adjusting the waypoints after reaching (10.0, 7.0) to navigate around and above the obstacles, ensuring the path remains non-crossing and ends within the goal set.

[08/28/2024 03:43:10 PM] new_path = To correct the provided path, let's analyze the issues and adjust it to avoid the obstacles.

### Analysis

1. **Initial Path**: 
   - Starts at (1.0, 1.0), which is inside the start set. 
   - Ends at (19.0, 19.0), which is inside the goal set.
   - Passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 5.33).

2. **Obstacle Check**:
   - The segment between (15.0, 9.0) and (17.0, 17.0) intersects with Obstacle 3. This segment must be adjusted.

3. **Valid Subpath**:
   - The path up to (15.0, 9.0) is valid.

### Path Adjustments

To avoid Obstacle 3, we need to adjust the path from (15.0, 9.0) onward:

1. **Avoiding Obstacle 3**:
   - From (15.0, 9.0), steer the path around Obstacle 3 by moving to the side, passing beneath it, and then back up to a point safely outside of Obstacle 3's influence.

2. **Connecting to Goal**:
   - After circumventing the obstacle, continue the path towards the goal set.

### New Path Proposal

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),        # Start point within start set
    (9.0, 5.33),       # Breakpoint 1
    (10.0, 7.0),       # Continue smoothly
    (15.0, 9.0),       # Last valid point before obstacle
    (13.0, 16.0),      # Maneuver to avoid Obstacle 3
    (17.0, 16.5),      # Stay clear of obstacles, approach goal
    (19.0, 19.0)       # End point within goal set
]
```

### Explanation

- **From (15.0, 9.0) to (13.0, 16.0)**:  This step changes direction upwards, moving around Obstacle 3.
- **From (13.0, 16.0) to (17.0, 16.5)**: Moves parallel and distant from potential interference of Obstacle 3.
- **From (17.0, 16.5) to (19.0, 19.0)**: Safely approaches the goal set.

This path alteration ensures no segment crosses any obstacle while maintaining the requirements of starting in the start set, passing through a breakpoint, and ending in the goal set.

[08/28/2024 03:43:22 PM] new_path = I understand the task is to create a path from a start set to a goal set while avoiding obstacles and ensuring the path goes through specified breakpoints.

Let's break down the provided path and identify the problem:

### Provided Path
1. **Start:** (1.0, 1.0)
2. **Breakpoint 1:** (9.0, 5.33)
3. **Waypoint:** (10.0, 7.0)
4. **Problematic Segment:** (15.0, 9.0) to (13.0, 16.0)
5. **Waypoint:** (17.0, 16.5)
6. **End:** (19.0, 19.0)
   
The feedback indicates that the segment between (15.0, 9.0) and (13.0, 16.0) crosses obstacles 1 and 3. The longest valid subpath ends at (15.0, 9.0).

### Analyzing the Obstacles
- **Obstacle 1:** Affects movement between (10.0, 7.0) and (13.0, 16.0).
- **Obstacle 3:** Affects the segment from (10.0, 7.0) and (13.0, 16.0).

### Plan for Correction
1. **Avoid Intersection:** Adjust the path after (10.0, 7.0) to avoid crossing the obstacles.
2. **Preserve Breakpoints:** Ensure the path still passes through one of the breakpoints.

### New Path Proposal
We'll aim for a path that skirts around the obstacles by adjusting the problematic segment:

1. **Start:** (1.0, 1.0) – Within the start set.
2. **Breakpoint:** (9.0, 5.33) – Correct breakpoint.
3. **Adjustment:** Move slightly up and to the right to avoid the obstacle:
   - (10.5, 7.5)
4. **Continuation:** 
   - Move up to a point clear of the obstacles, then move towards the goal set:
   - (12.0, 12.0)
   - (14.0, 14.0)
5. **Goal Movement:**
   - Move towards the goal:
   - (17.5, 16.5) 
6. **End:** (19.0, 19.0) – Within the goal set.

### New Path
```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 5.33),
    (10.5, 7.5),
    (12.0, 12.0),
    (14.0, 14.0),
    (17.5, 16.5),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

This path aims to detour around the problematic zones while ensuring the path stays inside the designated start and goal areas, passing through the required breakpoints.

[08/28/2024 03:43:29 PM] new_path = Here's a breakdown of the thought process and adjustments made to the provided path:

**1. Start Point:**
The path starts at (1.0, 1.0), which is correctly within the start set.

**2. Breakpoint 1:**
The path correctly passes through the first breakpoint (9.0, 5.33).

**3. Problematic Segment:**
The segment between (10.5, 7.5) and (12.0, 12.0) intersects with Obstacle 3. This needs to be adjusted.

**4. Obstacle Avoidance:**
Since the segment intersects Obstacle 3, we'll need to adjust the path around this obstacle. One approach is to add waypoints to move around the obstacle.

**5. Path Adjustment:**
We can keep the valid subpath [(1.0, 1.0), (9.0, 5.33), (10.5, 7.5)] and then add waypoints to avoid Obstacle 3. For example, we can add a waypoint at (10.5, 10.0) to move the path above the obstacle, then another waypoint at (12.0, 13.0) to move the path above the second segment of Obstacle 3, and finally another waypoint at (14.0, 14.0) to connect to the original path.

**6. New Path:**
With these adjustments, the new path would be:
