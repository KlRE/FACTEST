# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[10.6, 17.4], [0.6, 19.3], [1.5, 17.5], [7.1, 15.9]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 7.36), (9.0, 19.85)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

[08/28/2024 03:26:07 PM] new_path = Here's a path that satisfies the requirements:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start within the start set
    (1.0, 7.5),  # Move upwards to intersection point with Breakpoint Set 1
    (9.0, 7.36), # Pass through (9.0, 7.36) from Breakpoint Set 1
    (9.0, 18.5), # Move upwards to avoid the obstacle
    (19.0, 18.5), # Move rightwards towards the goal
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End within the goal set
]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Start:** The path begins at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start set.
2. **Breakpoint Passage:** The path moves upwards to (1.0, 7.5), then passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 7.36) of Breakpoint Set 1.
3. **Obstacle Avoidance:** The path continues upwards to (9.0, 18.5), ensuring a safe distance from the obstacle while moving to the goal set.
4. **Goal:**  The path finally moves rightwards and ends at (19.0, 19.0), which lies within the goal set.

This path satisfies all requirements:

- Represents a valid sequence of waypoints.
- Starts within the start set and ends within the goal set.
- Passes through a breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1.
- Avoids intersecting the obstacle by maintaining a safe distance.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[08/28/2024 03:26:17 PM] new_path = Here’s a breakdown of the provided path and why it collides with an obstacle:

**Path Analysis**  
The provided path is:

1. (1.0, 1.0)
2. (1.0, 7.5)
3. (9.0, 7.36)
4. (9.0, 7.36)
5. (9.0, 18.5)
6. (19.0, 18.5)
7. (19.0, 19.0)

**Obstacle Collision**  
The problematic segment is from (9.0, 7.36) to (9.0, 18.5). This segment is a vertical line at x=9.0 between y=7.36 and y=18.5, which goes straight through Obstacle 1, defined by vertices [[10.6, 17.4], [0.6, 19.3], [1.5, 17.5], [7.1, 15.9]]. 

**Spatial Relationship**  
Obstacle 1 is positioned such that its vertices are below and to the left of the goal position, creating a diagonal block. The path tries to move vertically upwards but gets blocked.

**Corrected Path Strategy**  
To fix this:

1. **Avoid Vertical Movement:** Since there’s an obstacle in the upward path, we should introduce more lateral movement.
2. **Navigate Around Obstacle:** Adjust the path to go around the obstacle rather than straight through it.

**Corrected Path**

Here's a revised path:

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start
    (1.0, 7.5),  # First segment
    (9.0, 7.36), # Breakpoint
    (10.0, 7.36), # Move right slightly to avoid vertical collision
    (10.0, 16.0), # Move up while avoiding obstacle
    (15.0, 16.0), # Move right towards goal avoiding obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End in goal
]
```

**Explanation of Changes**

* **(10.0, 7.36):** Moves slightly to the right to prepare for upward movement without vertical overlap.
* **(10.0, 16.0):** Moves upwards, staying clear of obstacle boundaries.
* **(15.0, 16.0):** Moves right towards the goal, maintaining a safe distance from the obstacle.
* **(19.0, 19.0):** Ends the path within the goal set.

This solution prioritizes spatial awareness, maneuvering the path to avoid the obstacle while ensuring it passes through the given breakpoint and reaches the goal without any further collisions.
