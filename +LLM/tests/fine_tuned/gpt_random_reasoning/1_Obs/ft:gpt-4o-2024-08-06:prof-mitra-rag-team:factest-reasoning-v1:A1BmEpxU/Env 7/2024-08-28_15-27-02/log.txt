# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[7.4, 19.1], [15.9, 16.1], [17.3, 19.5], [11.3, 19.3]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 8.26), (9.0, 20.59)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]

[08/28/2024 03:27:06 PM] new_path = Here's a path that meets the requirements:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0), # Start within the start set
    (5.0, 10.0), # Move towards the breakpoints while avoiding obstacles
    (9.0, 8.26), # Pass through the first breakpoint
    (12.0, 15.0), # Continue moving towards the goal while maintaining a safe distance from obstacles
    (19.0, 19.0), # End within the goal set
]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Start Point:** The path begins at (1.0, 2.0), which is a point within the start set quadrilateral.
2. **Obstacle Avoidance:** The path is carefully planned to stay clear of the obstacle by choosing waypoints that maintain a safe distance. The waypoint at (5.0, 10.0) is positioned to be clear of the obstacle.
3. **Breakpoint:** The path goes through the breakpoint at (9.0, 8.26), fulfilling the requirement.
4. **Goal Point:** Finally, the path ends at (19.0, 19.0), which is inside the goal set quadrilateral.

This path ensures a linear connection between waypoints and avoids all obstacles while passing through the required breakpoint and staying within the designated start and goal sets.

[08/28/2024 03:27:18 PM] new_path = ### Analysis and Adjustments

1. **Initial Path:** The provided path starts at (1.0, 2.0) and ends at (19.0, 19.0), successfully navigating from the start to the goal set. However, the segment between (12.0, 15.0) and (19.0, 19.0) intersects with Obstacle 1.

2. **Longest Valid Subpath:** The path is valid until (12.0, 15.0). We need to adjust the path after this point to avoid the obstacle.

3. **Obstacle Avoidance:** Segment 4 intersects Obstacle 1, which is defined by the vertices [[7.4, 19.1], [15.9, 16.1], [17.3, 19.5], [11.3, 19.3]]. To avoid this, we need to find a path that navigates around this obstacle.

4. **Breakpoint Adjustment:** The path currently passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 8.26). We don't need to change this as it meets the requirement.

### New Path

We'll adjust the path to circumvent Obstacle 1:

* Start from (12.0, 15.0).
* Move to a point above Obstacle 1, say (13.0, 20.0) to avoid intersection.
* Finally, proceed to the goal set at (19.0, 19.0).

This adjustment ensures the path avoids crossing Obstacle 1 by routing above it.

```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0), 
    (5.0, 10.0), 
    (9.0, 8.26), 
    (12.0, 15.0), 
    (13.0, 20.0), 
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

### Explanation

* The path starts within the start set and ends within the goal set.
* The added waypoint (13.0, 20.0) ensures that the path bypasses Obstacle 1.
* The path passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 8.26), meeting the requirement. 

This provides a valid path that successfully navigates from the start to the goal while avoiding obstacles.

[08/28/2024 03:27:27 PM] new_path = To adjust the path and avoid the obstacle, let's analyze the situation and modify the path:

### Analysis

1. **Current Path:** The path is valid up to the point \((12.0, 15.0)\). The segment from \((12.0, 15.0)\) to \((13.0, 20.0)\) intersects with Obstacle 1.
2. **Obstacle Avoidance:** We need to circumvent Obstacle 1. Consider moving the path towards the left or right, avoiding the obstacle's boundaries.
3. **Breakpoint Compliance:** Ensure the path passes through the required breakpoint \((9.0, 8.26)\).

### Proposed Changes

We will modify the segment after \((12.0, 15.0)\) to avoid crossing Obstacle 1.

### New Path

``` 
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0),  # Start in the start set
    (5.0, 10.0), # Move towards the breakpoint
    (9.0, 8.26), # Pass through the required breakpoint
    (12.0, 15.0), # Point before crossing the obstacle
    (11.0, 16.0), # Adjust path to go around the obstacle
    (13.0, 17.0), # Continue path around the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End in the goal set
]
```

### Explanation

- **Waypoint Addition:** We added \((11.0, 16.0)\) and \((13.0, 17.0)\) to smoothly arc the path around the obstacle.
- **Obstacle Clearance:** These new waypoints ensure the path avoids intersecting with Obstacle 1.
- **Goal Compliance:** The path still ends inside the goal set.

By making these changes, the path will be valid, avoiding obstacles and adhering to the required breakpoints.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/28/2024 03:27:39 PM] new_path = To correct the path, we need to ensure it avoids Obstacle 1 and still connects from the start set to the goal set, passing through a breakpoint.

### Analysis

1. **Current Path:**
   - The path segments in the initial path go as follows:
     1. (1.0, 2.0) -> (5.0, 10.0)
     2. (5.0, 10.0) -> (9.0, 8.26)
     3. (9.0, 8.26) -> (12.0, 15.0)
     4. (12.0, 15.0) -> (11.0, 16.0)
     5. (11.0, 16.0) -> (13.0, 17.0)
     6. **(13.0, 17.0) -> (19.0, 19.0)** *(Problematic due to intersection)*
 
2. **Obstacle:**
   - Obstacle 1 is defined by the vertices [[7.4, 19.1], [15.9, 16.1], [17.3, 19.5], [11.3, 19.3]].
   - The segment between (13.0, 17.0) and (19.0, 19.0) crosses into this obstacle.

### Suggested Path Adjustment

1. **Identify a Detour:**
   - We need to reroute the path to avoid intersecting the obstacle. Since the obstacle is positioned higher than the previous waypoints, we will create a path that moves around it from a lower position.

2. **New Waypoints:**
   - Starting from the valid segment ending at (13.0, 17.0), we can adjust the path to move below the obstacle.
   - Adjust the path to go below the obstacle, then move up to the goal set.

3. **Planned Path Adjustment:**
   - **(13.0, 17.0)** – from here, move down and then steer clear of the obstacle.
   - **(13.0, 15.0)** – move slightly down to ensure clearance below the obstacle.
   - **(16.0, 15.0)** – move horizontally to the right, below the obstacle.
   - **(18.5, 18.0)** – move back upwards and towards the goal set.
   - **(19.0, 19.0)** – a slight adjustment for final position.
   - **(19.0, 19.0)** – end inside the goal set.

### New Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0),
    (5.0, 10.0),
    (9.0, 8.26),
    (12.0, 15.0),
    (11.0, 16.0),
    (13.0, 17.0),
    (13.0, 15.0),
    (16.0, 15.0),
    (18.5, 18.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

### Explanation of Changes

- After reaching the last valid point (13.0, 17.0), the path is routed downwards to avoid the obstacle, ensuring the path stays clear of any intersections.
- The path then moves below the obstacle (16.0, 15.0), ensuring a wide enough berth to avoid any contact.
- Finally, the path moves back up to enter the goal set (18.5, 18.0 and 19.0, 19.0). 

This adjusted path starts from the start set, passes through the provided breakpoint (9.0, 8.26), navigates around the obstacle, and finally reaches the goal set without intersecting any obstacles.
