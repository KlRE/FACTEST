# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[16.9, 17.4], [16.0, 17.9], [16.1, 16.1], [16.7, 13.1]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 10.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/28/2024 03:30:09 PM] new_path = Here's a possible path solution, considering the provided data and the path requirements:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0), # start in the start set
    (1.0, 7.0), # move upwards to reach the y-coordinate of the breakpoint
    (9.0, 10.0), # pass through the breakpoint
    (17.5, 16.0), # move diagonally towards the goal, avoiding the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)  # end in the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

* **Waypoint 1 (1.0, 2.0):** This starting point is inside the start set.
* **Waypoint 2 (1.0, 7.0):**  We move vertically upwards to reach a y-coordinate that is close to the breakpoint (9.0, 10.0). 
* **Waypoint 3 (9.0, 10.0):** This point represents the chosen breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1. We ensure that the path passes through this point.
* **Waypoint 4 (17.5, 16.0):** We move diagonally towards the goal set, ensuring to avoid the obstacle with vertices [[16.9, 17.4], [16.0, 17.9], [16.1, 16.1], [16.7, 13.1]]. By keeping the y-coordinate slightly below 17.4, we avoid any intersection with the obstacle. 
* **Waypoint 5 (19.0, 19.0):** This final point is inside the goal set. 

**Key Considerations:**

* **Obstacle Avoidance:** The path carefully avoids the obstacle by maneuvering below its top segment.
* **Linear Segments:** The linear segments connecting the waypoints ensure that the path does not intersect with any obstacles.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Goal Position: End within the specified rectangular goal set.
Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[08/28/2024 03:30:18 PM] new_path = To correct the path while considering the given feedback, let’s break down the problem and address each requirement:

### Analysis

1. **Start and End:** The path you provided starts at \((1.0, 2.0)\), which is inside the start quadrilateral. However, it ends at \((16.9, 17.4)\), which is not inside the goal quadrilateral \([[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]\).

2. **Obstacles:** The path segment between \((9.0, 10.0)\) and \((17.5, 16.0)\) crosses Obstacle 1. We need to reroute around it.

3. **Breakpoints:** The provided path correctly uses the breakpoint \((9.0, 10.0)\) from Set 1.

### Adjustments

1. **Reroute Around the Obstacle:**
   - To avoid Obstacle 1, we can route the path above it. Consider adding a waypoint to the north of the obstacle before proceeding to the next breakpoint.

2. **Ensure Goal Completion:**
   - After routing around the obstacle, ensure the path continues to the goal quadrilateral.

### New Path Proposal

1. **Start at a point within the start set.**
2. Use the set breakpoint.
3. Route around the obstacle.
4. End within the goal set.

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0),     # Start inside the start set
    (1.0, 7.0),     # Move upwards
    (9.0, 10.0),    # Pass through the breakpoint
    (12.0, 18.0),   # Move north of Obstacle 1 (ensuring no intersection)
    (19.0, 19.0),   # Move into the goal set
]
```

### Explanation

- **We start at \((1.0, 2.0)\) and move upwards.**
- **The path goes through the breakpoint at \((9.0, 10.0)\).**
- **We then move to \((12.0, 18.0)\), carefully avoiding Obstacle 1 by staying to its north.**
- **Finally, the path ends at \((19.0, 19.0)\), which is inside the goal quadrilateral.**

This path ensures:
- **Start and end** within the specified regions.
- **Avoidance** of the obstacle.
- **Passing through** the breakpoint as required.
