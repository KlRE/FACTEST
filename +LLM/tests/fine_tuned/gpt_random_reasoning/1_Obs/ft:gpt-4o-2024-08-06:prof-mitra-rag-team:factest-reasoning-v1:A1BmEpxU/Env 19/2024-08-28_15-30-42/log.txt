# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[17.4, 12.7], [11.2, 13.1], [16.4, 10.6], [19.1, 9.4]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 10.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

[08/28/2024 03:30:46 PM] new_path = Hereâ€™s a possible path solution, considering the provided data and requirements:

### Path Array
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start point within the start set
    (9.0, 10.0), # Pass through the breakpoint
    (16.0, 15.0), # Navigate around the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End point within the goal set
]
```

### Analysis

1. **Start:** The path begins at (1.0, 1.0), a point inside the start quadrilateral.

2. **Breakpoint:** It passes through the breakpoint (9.0, 10.0) as required.

3. **Obstacle Avoidance:** The waypoint (16.0, 15.0) is strategically placed to navigate around the obstacle, maintaining a safe distance. 

4. **End:** The path concludes at (19.0, 19.0), safely within the goal quadrilateral.

This path meets all the specified requirements: it starts within the start set, passes through the breakpoint, avoids the obstacle, and ends within the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

[08/28/2024 03:30:53 PM] Sure, let's analyze the situation and adjust the path to avoid the obstacle:

### Current Path
* **Start:** (1.0, 1.0)
* **Breakpoint:** (9.0, 10.0)
* **Invalid Segment:** (9.0, 10.0) to (16.0, 15.0) â€” intersects Obstacle 1.
* **Goal:** (19.0, 19.0)

### Problem
The path's second segment intersects Obstacle 1. We need to find a way to bypass this obstacle.

### Solution
1. **Use the Valid Subpath:** Start from (1.0, 1.0) and pass through the breakpoint (9.0, 10.0).
2. **Bypass the Obstacle:** Instead of moving towards (16.0, 15.0), shift the path to avoid the obstacle by moving north-east.
3. **Reach the Goal:** Ensure the path ends within the goal set without intersecting any obstacles.

### New Path
1. **Start:** (1.0, 1.0)
2. **Breakpoint:** (9.0, 10.0)
3. **Avoid Obstacle:** (12.0, 16.0) â€” moves the path north-east, avoiding Obstacle 1.
4. **Goal:** (19.0, 19.0)

### New Path Format
```python
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (9.0, 10.0),
    (12.0, 16.0),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]
```

### Explanation
* We're leveraging the valid initial subpath.
* We then carefully adjust the second segment to steer clear of the obstacle by adding a waypoint.
* The path finally reaches the goal area while ensuring no collision with obstacles.

This new path should comply with all requirements while successfully avoiding any intersections with obstacles.
