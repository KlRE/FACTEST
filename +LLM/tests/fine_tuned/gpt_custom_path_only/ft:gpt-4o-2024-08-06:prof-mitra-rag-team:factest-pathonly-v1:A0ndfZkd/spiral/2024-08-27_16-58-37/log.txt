# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.75, 0.75], [0.25, 0.75], [0.25, 0.25], [0.75, 0.25]]

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.75, 0.75], [0.25, 0.75], [0.25, 0.25], [0.75, 0.25]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.0, 0.0], [-2.0, 0.0], [-2.0, -2.0], [15.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.0, 15.0], [-2.0, 15.0], [-2.0, -0.0], [0.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[4.0, 14.0], [1.0, 14.0], [1.0, 1.0], [4.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 4: [[14.0, 4.0], [4.0, 4.0], [4.0, 1.0], [14.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 5: [[14.0, 10.0], [5.0, 10.0], [5.0, 4.0], [14.0, 4.0]]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.5, 0.5), (5.74, 0.0), (4.5, 4.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 1 between points (0.5, 0.5) and (5.74, 0.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 1: [[15.0, 0.0], [-2.0, 0.0], [-2.0, -2.0], [15.0, -2.0]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.5, 0.5)]
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Missing breakpoint sets:
 		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.25, 0.5), (2.25, 14.5)]
	

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

[08/27/2024 04:59:04 PM] To create a valid path, I need to address the obstacle crossing identified in the feedback.

1. **Start Path**: Start at (0.5, 0.5) inside the start set.
2. **Initial Breakpoint**: Move to the first breakpoint (2.25, 0.5) while avoiding obstacles.
3. **Obstacle Issue**: The previous path from (2.25, 0.5) to (2.27, 15.16) crosses Obstacle 3.

To correct this and find a valid pathway:

4. **New Breakpoint**: Instead of going upwards and crossing Obstacle 3, let's move towards the right of it. 

5. **Adjust Path**:
   - From (2.25, 0.5), move to (1.56, 0.0) to avoid any obstacles and border them along the right edge of Obstacle 3.
   - Proceed to Breakpoint (4.48, 0.0), staying clear of Obstacle 5.
   - Finally, move upward to (4.5, 4.5) to end in the goal set.

This path ensures the path remains clear of obstacles.

## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.75, 0.75], [0.25, 0.75], [0.25, 0.25], [0.75, 0.25]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.0, 0.0], [-2.0, 0.0], [-2.0, -2.0], [15.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.0, 15.0], [-2.0, 15.0], [-2.0, -0.0], [0.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[4.0, 14.0], [1.0, 14.0], [1.0, 1.0], [4.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 4: [[14.0, 4.0], [4.0, 4.0], [4.0, 1.0], [14.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 5: [[14.0, 10.0], [5.0, 10.0], [5.0, 4.0], [14.0, 4.0]]
			Obstacle 6: [[14.0, 14.0], [4.0, 14.0], [4.0, 11.0], [14.0, 11.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.25, 0.5), (2.25, 14.5)]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.5, 0.5), (2.25, 0.5), (1.56, 0.0), (4.48, -0.98), (4.5, 4.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 2 between points (2.25, 0.5) and (1.56, 0.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 1: [[15.0, 0.0], [-2.0, 0.0], [-2.0, -2.0], [15.0, -2.0]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.5, 0.5), (2.25, 0.5)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.75, 0.75], [0.25, 0.75], [0.25, 0.25], [0.75, 0.25]]

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.0, 0.0], [-2.0, 0.0], [-2.0, -2.0], [15.0, -2.0]]

    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.75, 0.75], [0.25, 0.75], [0.25, 0.25], [0.75, 0.25]]

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.0, 0.0], [-2.0, 0.0], [-2.0, -2.0], [15.0, -2.0]]

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.75, 0.75], [0.25, 0.75], [0.25, 0.25], [0.75, 0.25]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.0, 0.0], [-2.0, 0.0], [-2.0, -2.0], [15.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.0, 15.0], [-2.0, 15.0], [-2.0, -0.0], [0.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[4.0, 14.0], [1.0, 14.0], [1.0, 1.0], [4.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 4: [[14.0, 4.0], [4.0, 4.0], [4.0, 1.0], [14.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 5: [[14.0, 10.0], [5.0, 10.0], [5.0, 4.0], [14.0, 4.0]]
			Obstacle 6: [[14.0, 14.0], [4.0, 14.0], [4.0, 11.0], [14.0, 11.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.25, 0.5), (2.25, 14.5)]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.5, 0.5), (2.23, -2.0), (14.0, 3.93), (4.5, 4.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 1 between points (0.5, 0.5) and (2.23, -2.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 1: [[15.0, 0.0], [-2.0, 0.0], [-2.0, -2.0], [15.0, -2.0]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.5, 0.5)]
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Missing breakpoint sets:
 		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.25, 0.5), (2.25, 14.5)]
	

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
