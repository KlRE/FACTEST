# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Polygon): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.75, 0.75], [0.25, 0.75], [0.25, 0.25], [0.75, 0.25]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this polygon to start the path.

        Note: You can choose any point within this polygon to end the path.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.

		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.

## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
[08/19/2024 05:23:18 PM] The feedback correctly identified that the second segment of the path crosses obstacle 3. To avoid this, we can route the path around the left side of the obstacle. 

Here's the thought process for the adjusted path:

1. **Valid Subpath:**  We can utilize the longest valid subpath provided: `[(0.5, 0.5), (2.25, 0.5)]`.
2. **Circumventing Obstacle 3:** To go around obstacle 3, we need to navigate beyond its leftmost x-coordinate.  We can achieve this by adding a waypoint at `(0.5, 14.5)`. This allows us to move vertically without colliding with obstacle 3.
3. **Reaching the Goal:** Now, we can connect to the breakpoint at `(2.25, 14.5)` and proceed with the original path, going through `(4.5, 14.5)` and finally to `(4.5, 4.5)` within the goal set.

Therefore, the corrected path is: 

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (2.25, 0.5), (0.5, 14.5), (2.25, 14.5), (4.5, 14.5), (4.5, 4.5)]

    ]
    
[08/19/2024 05:23:27 PM] The current path attempts to cross from the bottom to the top of the environment in a single step, leading to a collision with obstacle 3.  A safer approach would be to navigate around the right side of the obstacles.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (2.25, 0.5), (2.25, 3.5), (14.5, 3.5), (14.5, 14.5), (4.5, 14.5), (4.5, 4.5)] 
```

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Analyze the valid subpath:** The feedback tells us that the path is valid until `(2.25, 0.5)`.
2. **Identify the obstacle:** The problematic segment intersects with Obstacle 3, which spans horizontally across the environment.
3. **Navigate around the obstacle:**
    -  Instead of directly moving upward, we can guide the path to the right, going around Obstacle 3. 
    - A new waypoint `(2.25, 3.5)` is added to move above the obstacle while staying within the x-coordinate of the breakpoint.
    - Then, the path moves right, clearing all the obstacles with `(14.5, 3.5)`.
    - From there, it's safe to move upward to `(14.5, 14.5)`, bypassing all obstacles.
4. **Reach the goal:** The path then proceeds left and downward to reach the goal region using waypoints  `(4.5, 14.5)` and `(4.5, 4.5)`.

This adjusted path avoids obstacles by maneuvering around them and ensures a safe passage to the goal.

[08/19/2024 05:23:36 PM] The feedback correctly points out that the second segment of the proposed path, going from (2.25, 0.5) vertically to (2.25, 3.5), cuts through Obstacle 3.  We need to adjust the path to avoid this.

Let's rethink the approach. Since we need to pass through a breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1, and the current path's choice of (2.25, 0.5) leads to a collision, let's try the other breakpoint in the set: (2.25, 14.5).

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    (0.5, 14.5), (2.25, 14.5), (4.5, 14.5), (4.5, 4.5) 
]
```

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Start:** Begin at (0.5, 0.5) within the start set.
2. **First Breakpoint:**  We need to hit (2.25, 14.5). To do this safely, move vertically to (0.5, 14.5), then horizontally to the breakpoint.
3. **Navigating Obstacles:** From (2.25, 14.5), we can move horizontally to the right, avoiding Obstacle 6.
4. **Reaching the Goal:** Continue horizontally until we can safely move down to (4.5, 4.5), which is inside the goal set.

This new path avoids all obstacles while satisfying the given constraints.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
[08/19/2024 05:23:43 PM] The feedback correctly points out that the segment connecting (4.5, 14.5) and (4.5, 4.5) cuts through Obstacle 6. To circumvent this, we need to guide the path around this obstacle.

Let's adjust the path as follows:

1.  **From the last valid waypoint (4.5, 14.5):** Instead of going directly down, let's navigate to the right, away from Obstacle 6. 
2. **Navigate around Obstacle 6:** We'll introduce a new waypoint (14.5, 14.5) to move clear of Obstacle 6.
3. **Descend towards the goal:** From (14.5, 14.5), we can safely move down towards the goal set, bypassing all obstacles. Let's add another waypoint at (14.5, 4.5).
4. **Reach the goal:** Finally, we can connect to the goal set with the waypoint (4.5, 4.5). 

Therefore, the revised path is:

    new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 14.5), (2.25, 14.5), (4.5, 14.5), (14.5, 14.5), (14.5, 4.5), (4.5, 4.5)]

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Polygon): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.75, 0.75], [0.25, 0.75], [0.25, 0.25], [0.75, 0.25]]

    ]
    
[08/19/2024 05:23:51 PM] The feedback correctly identified that the segment connecting (14.5, 4.5) and (4.5, 4.5) crosses Obstacle 5.  To avoid this, we need to navigate around Obstacle 5. 

Here's a possible adjustment, leveraging the existing valid subpath:

1. **Start from the last valid point:** (14.5, 4.5)
2. **Navigate above Obstacle 5:** Since the goal is below and to the left, we can't go down.  Let's move right, then up, then left to clear Obstacle 5:
    * (14.5, 10.5)  
    * (4.5, 10.5)
3. **Reach the goal:** Now we have a clear path to the goal area:
    * (4.5, 4.5) 

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 14.5), 
    (2.25, 14.5),
