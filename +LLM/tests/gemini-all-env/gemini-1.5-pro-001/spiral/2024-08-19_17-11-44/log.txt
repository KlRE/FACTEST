# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Polygon): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.75, 0.75], [0.25, 0.75], [0.25, 0.25], [0.75, 0.25]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this polygon to start the path.
    Goal Position (Polygon): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this polygon to end the path.
    Obstacles (Polygons):    Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

			Obstacle 5: [[14.0, 10.0], [5.0, 10.0], [5.0, 4.0], [14.0, 4.0]]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [

    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
[08/19/2024 05:11:55 PM] The feedback correctly identified the issue: the segment from (2.25, 0.5) to (2.25, 14.5) cuts through Obstacle 3. We need to navigate around this obstacle. 

Since we must go through a breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1, let's stick with (2.25, 14.5) and find a way around Obstacle 3.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (2.25, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Backtrack to avoid obstacle 
    (0.5, 14.5), # Move up north, clear of obstacles
    (2.25, 14.5), # Now safe to approach breakpoint 
    (4.5, 14.5), 
    (4.5, 4.5)
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Backtrack:** From (2.25, 0.5), we backtrack slightly to (0.5, 0.5).
2. **Clear Path North:** We move vertically up to (0.5, 14.5). This path is clear of all obstacles.
3. **Approach Breakpoint:** We can now safely move horizontally to our target breakpoint (2.25, 14.5).
4. **Continue Original Path:**  The rest of the path remains valid and can be followed as initially planned. 

This adjusted path avoids Obstacle 3 while still satisfying the requirement of passing through a breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1.

    ]
    
[08/19/2024 05:12:01 PM] The feedback correctly identified that the path crosses Obstacle 6 because the segment going from (4.5, 14.5) to (4.5, 4.5) cuts through the obstacle. 

To fix this, I will adjust the path to go around Obstacle 6. Since the longest valid subpath ends at (4.5, 14.5), I'll add a waypoint to the right of Obstacle 6 at (14.5, 14.5).  From there, I can navigate down to the goal position without encountering any obstacles.

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (2.25, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 14.5), (2.25, 14.5), (4.5, 14.5), (14.5, 14.5), (14.5, 4.5), (4.5, 4.5)]

[08/19/2024 05:12:12 PM] The feedback indicated that the segment connecting (14.5, 4.5) and (4.5, 4.5) crosses Obstacle 5. To circumvent this, we can reroute the path by going above Obstacle 5. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (2.25, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 14.5), (2.25, 14.5), (4.5, 14.5), (14.5, 14.5), (14.5, 10.5), (4.5, 10.5), (4.5, 4.5)]
```

Here's the thought process behind this change:

1. **Identify the problematic segment:** The feedback clearly highlights the segment between (14.5, 4.5) and (4.5, 4.5) as intersecting Obstacle 5.
2. **Analyze the obstacle:** Obstacle 5 occupies the area with y-coordinates roughly between 4.0 and 10.0.
3. **Determine a safe passage:** To avoid Obstacle 5, we need to route the path either above y = 10.0 or below y = 4.0. Since the goal is at (4.5, 4.5), going above is the more logical choice.
4. **Add waypoints:** To guide the path above Obstacle 5, we introduce two waypoints: 
    - (14.5, 10.5): This waypoint moves the path upwards, clear of Obstacle 5.
    - (4.5, 10.5): This waypoint maintains a safe distance from Obstacle 5 while moving towards the goal.
5. **Connect to the goal:** The final segment now connects (4.5, 10.5) to (4.5, 4.5) without intersecting any obstacles.

This adjusted path addresses the obstacle intersection issue and should provide a valid solution to the motion planning task.
