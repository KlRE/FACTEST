# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Polygon): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this polygon to start the path.
    Goal Position (Polygon): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this polygon to end the path.
    Obstacles (Polygons):    Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.

    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
[08/19/2024 03:52:44 PM] The issue lies with the second segment of the path, connecting (2.0, -2.5) and (2.0, 5.5). This segment directly overlaps with both Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3. 

To circumvent this, we need to navigate around these obstacles. Let's adjust the path as follows:

1.  **From the last valid waypoint (2.0, -2.5):**  We need to move towards the goal while dodging obstacles. 
2.  **Introduce a waypoint to the right:** Since obstacles 2 and 3 are to the left, let's add a waypoint to the right, say (3.0, -2.5).
3.  **Navigate upwards:** From (3.0, -2.5), we can move upwards to (3.0, 5.5), safely bypassing the obstacles.
4.  **Connect to the goal:** Finally, connect this point to the goal at (4.5, 4.5).

**New Path:**
```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, -2.5), (3.0, -2.5), (3.0, 5.5), (4.5, 4.5)]
```

This revised path starts within the start set, traverses through a breakpoint in the first breakpoint set, avoids all obstacles, and successfully reaches the goal set.

[08/19/2024 03:53:03 PM] The feedback correctly identified that the path crosses "Obstacle 2" because the segment from (3.0, -2.5) to (3.0, 5.5) cuts right through it. 

To fix this, we need to navigate around "Obstacle 2".  We can achieve this by making the following changes to the path:

1. **From the last valid waypoint (3.0, -2.5), move horizontally to the right, creating a safe distance from "Obstacle 2". Let's choose (4.0, -2.5) as the next waypoint.** 

2. **Now, we can safely move upwards to bypass "Obstacle 2".  We'll aim for a point above the obstacle, like (4.0, 3.0).**

3. **Finally, we can proceed to the goal region. We'll connect to the final waypoint (4.5, 4.5) from our current position.**

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, -2.5), (3.0, -2.5), (4.0, -2.5), (4.0, 3.0), (4.5, 4.5)] 
```

This new path avoids all obstacles while still adhering to the given breakpoints and start/end region requirements.

    ]
    
[08/19/2024 03:53:11 PM] ## Chain of Thought for Path Correction:

The feedback indicates that the segment connecting (4.0, -2.5) and (4.0, 3.0) crosses both Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2. This is because the segment goes vertically straight up, directly through these obstacles. 

Therefore, we need to adjust the path to navigate around these obstacles. Since the longest valid subpath ends at (4.0, -2.5), we'll aim to find a new route from this point towards the goal.

Here's a possible strategy:

1. **Navigate Right:**  From (4.0, -2.5), we can move rightwards, going around Obstacle 1.
2. **Navigate Upwards:** Once we've cleared Obstacle 1, we can move upwards, aiming to reach the goal set. We need to ensure we stay clear of Obstacle 2 while doing so. 

## New Path Proposal:

Based on this strategy, here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   
    (2.0, -2.5),  
    (3.0, -2.5),
    (4.0, -2.5),  
    (6.5, -2.5),   # Move right to clear Obstacle 1
    (6.5, 5.5),   # Move up to clear all obstacles 
    (4.5, 4.5)    # Reach the goal set
] 
```

This new path aims to navigate around the obstacles while still fulfilling the requirements of starting and ending within the designated sets and passing through the specified breakpoints.
