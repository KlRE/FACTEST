# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Polygon): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this polygon to start the path.
    Goal Position (Polygon): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this polygon to end the path.
    Obstacles (Polygons):    Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[3.9999999999999996, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [3.9999999999999996, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.0, 3.9999999999999996], [-2.0, 3.9999999999999996], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 1.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
[08/19/2024 03:58:02 PM] ```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start polygon
    (2.0, -2.5),   # Breakpoint Set 1
    (2.0, -3.0),   # Navigate below Obstacle 1 
    (3.5, -3.0),   # Move towards the goal, staying below obstacles
    (3.5, 4.5),    # Navigate upwards towards the goal
    (4.5, 4.5)     # End within the goal polygon 
]
``` 

**Explanation:**

1. **(0.5, 0.5):** Starts within the start polygon.
2. **(2.0, -2.5):**  Passes through a breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1.
3. **(2.0, -3.0):**  Moves further down to safely clear Obstacle 1.
4. **(3.5, -3.0):**  Moves right, maintaining a safe distance below Obstacle 1.
5. **(3.5, 4.5):**  Moves upwards, safely clearing both obstacles.
6. **(4.5, 4.5):**  Ends within the goal polygon.

        Note: You can choose any point within this polygon to end the path.
    Obstacles (Polygons):    Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[3.9999999999999996, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [3.9999999999999996, -0.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 1.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Polygon): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 4 between points (3.5, -3.0) and (3.5, 4.5) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 1: [[3.9999999999999996, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [3.9999999999999996, -0.0]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, -2.5), (2.0, -3.0), (3.5, -3.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
[08/19/2024 03:58:08 PM] The feedback correctly identified that the segment connecting (3.5, -3.0) and (3.5, 4.5) cuts through Obstacle 1. 

To navigate around this, I will adjust the path to go around the right side of the obstacle. Since the obstacle's rightmost x-coordinate is very close to 4.0, I'll aim to keep the path at an x-coordinate of 4.0 until it's clear to move towards the goal. 

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (2.0, -2.5), 
    (2.0, -3.0), 
    (4.0, -3.0), # Skirt below Obstacle 1
    (4.0, 4.5), # Move up to the level of the goal
    (4.5, 4.5) 
]
```

This path maintains a safe distance from Obstacle 1 while still passing through the required breakpoint and reaching the goal set.

        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
[08/19/2024 03:58:17 PM] The feedback correctly pointed out that the segment from (4.0, -3.0) to (4.0, 4.5) crosses obstacle 1. To avoid this, we need to adjust the path. 

Here's the thought process for path correction:

1. **Analyze the longest valid subpath:** The provided longest valid subpath ends at (4.0, -3.0), which is below obstacle 1 and directly south of the goal set. 
2. **Identify a new route:** We need to navigate around obstacle 1 to reach the goal set. Since obstacle 1 is a thin horizontal rectangle, we can  route the path around its right edge.
3. **Add waypoints:** To achieve this, we can add two waypoints: 
    * One waypoint to the east of obstacle 1, such as (4.1, -3.0).
    * Another waypoint to the north, clearing the top edge of obstacle 1,  and moving towards the goal set, such as (4.1, 4.5).

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, -2.5), (2.0, -3.0), (4.0, -3.0), (4.1, -3.0), (4.1, 4.5), (4.5, 4.5)]
```

This path now avoids obstacle 1 while still satisfying all other requirements:

* **Start and End:** The path starts within the start set and ends within the goal set.
* **Breakpoints:** It passes through the breakpoint (2.0, -2.5) from Breakpoint Set 1.
* **Non-Crossing:** The adjusted segments avoid crossing any obstacles.
