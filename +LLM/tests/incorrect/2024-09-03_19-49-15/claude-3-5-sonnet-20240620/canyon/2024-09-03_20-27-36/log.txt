# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]

## Example
### Provided Data

Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

[09/03/2024 08:27:39 PM] Given the provided data, here is a potential path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids the obstacles:

new_path = [
    (0.37, 1.37),  # Start point within the start set
    (1.5, 2.5),    # First waypoint
    (3.0, 2.5),    # Second waypoint
    (3.83, 3.37)   # End point within the goal set
]

This path starts at the point (0.37, 1.37), which is within the start set defined by the four vertices. It then moves to the first waypoint at (1.5, 2.5), which is positioned to avoid the first obstacle. From there, it moves to the second waypoint at (3.0, 2.5), which allows it to pass through the gap between the two obstacles. Finally, it ends at the point (3.83, 3.37), which is within the goal set defined by the four vertices.

The path avoids crossing any of the obstacles by maintaining a safe distance from them. The linearly connected segments between the waypoints do not intersect with the obstacles. This path satisfies the provided requirements.

[09/03/2024 08:27:44 PM] To solve this motion planning task, I will go through the following steps:

1. Analyze the start and goal sets, as well as the obstacle locations.
2. Determine a feasible path that starts within the start set, ends within the goal set, and avoids the obstacles.
3. Provide the new path as an array of waypoints.

Analysis of the Start and Goal Sets, and Obstacles:
- The start set is a quadrilateral defined by the coordinates [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]].
- The goal set is a quadrilateral defined by the coordinates [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]].
- There are two obstacles, each defined by a quadrilateral:
  - Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
  - Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

Determining a Feasible Path:
- The initial path provided, [(0.37, 1.37), (1.5, 2.5), (3.0, 2.5), (3.83, 3.37)], does not meet the requirements.
- To find a valid path, we need to start within the start set and end within the goal set, while avoiding the obstacles.
- Looking at the spatial relationships, we can see that there is a clear path between the start set and the goal set, going around the obstacles.
- To avoid the obstacles, we can add an additional waypoint to the path, moving it up and to the right to clear the obstacles.

New Path:
new_path = [
    (0.37, 1.37),  # Start within the start set
    (1.0, 2.0),    # Move up and to the right to avoid Obstacle 1
    (3.0, 2.5),    # Move towards the goal set
    (3.83, 3.37)   # End within the goal set
]

This new path starts within the start set, ends within the goal set, and avoids both obstacles by adding an additional waypoint to move the path around the obstacles.

[09/03/2024 08:27:48 PM] Analyzing the provided data and feedback, here's my thought process to generate a new path that satisfies the requirements:

1. Start Position:
   - The provided start set is a quadrilateral defined by the coordinates `[[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]`.
   - The previous path did not start within this start set, so I need to ensure the new path starts within this quadrilateral.

2. Obstacle Avoidance:
   - The previous path intersected with both obstacle 1 and obstacle 2, which is not allowed.
   - To avoid the obstacles, I need to find a path that goes around them without crossing any of the obstacle boundaries.

3. End Position:
   - The previous path did not end within the goal set, which is defined by the coordinates `[[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]`.
   - The new path should end within this goal set quadrilateral.

With these requirements in mind, I propose the following new path:

new_path = [
    (0.1, 0.9),  # Start point within the start set
    (1.0, 2.0),  # Move upwards and to the right to avoid obstacle 1
    (2.5, 2.5),  # Continue moving to the right, still avoiding obstacle 1
    (3.5, 3.0)   # Move upwards to end within the goal set
]

Explanation:
1. I chose the start point (0.1, 0.9) which is inside the start set quadrilateral.
2. The first waypoint (1.0, 2.0) moves the path upwards and to the right, avoiding the first obstacle.
3. The second waypoint (2.5, 2.5) continues moving the path to the right, still avoiding the first obstacle.
4. The final waypoint (3.5, 3.0) moves the path upwards to end within the goal set quadrilateral.

By adjusting the waypoints, I was able to generate a path that starts within the start set, avoids both obstacles, and ends within the goal set, satisfying all the requirements.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/03/2024 08:27:52 PM] To address the issue of the provided path intersecting with the obstacles, I will analyze the spatial relationships between the path segments and the obstacles, and then adjust the path accordingly.

The first segment of the path, from (0.1, 0.9) to (1.0, 2.0), intersects with Obstacle 1. This is because the line connecting these two points passes through the area occupied by Obstacle 1. To avoid this, we need to modify the path to go around the obstacle.

One potential solution is to add an additional waypoint to the path that allows us to navigate around the obstacle. We can add a waypoint at (1.0, 1.0), which is inside the start set but outside the obstacle. This would give us the following path:

new_path = [
    (0.1, 0.9),
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (1.5, 1.5),
    (2.5, 2.5),
    (3.5, 3.0)
]

The second segment of the original path, from (1.0, 2.0) to (2.5, 2.5), also intersects with Obstacle 1. To avoid this, we can add another waypoint at (1.5, 1.5), which is between the first two waypoints and outside the obstacle.

The final path avoids both obstacles by adding two additional waypoints, (1.0, 1.0) and (1.5, 1.5), to navigate around the obstacles. This ensures that the path starts within the start set, ends within the goal set, and does not intersect with any obstacles.
