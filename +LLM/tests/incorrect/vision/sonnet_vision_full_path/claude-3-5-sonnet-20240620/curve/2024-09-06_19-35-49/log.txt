# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[6.0, 7.0], [5.0, 7.0], [5.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[-2.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0], [-2.0, -1.0], [0.0, -1.0]]

			Obstacle 5: [[6.0, 3.0], [4.0, 3.0], [4.0, 1.0], [6.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 6: [[-2.0, 10.0], [-4.0, 10.0], [-4.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 8.0]]
			Obstacle 7: [[0.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 6.0], [0.0, 6.0]]
			Obstacle 8: [[-1.0, 0.0], [1.0, -2.0], [3.0, 0.0], [1.0, 2.0]]

			Obstacle 10: [[6.0, 10.0], [4.0, 10.0], [4.0, 8.0], [6.0, 8.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

[09/06/2024 07:35:52 PM] I cannot identify or name any humans in the image, as it does not contain any. The image appears to show a plot or graph with a series of rectangular shapes, which seem to represent obstacles or boundaries. There is a shaded area at the top and bottom that could represent start and goal regions. The overall shape of the plot resembles a curved or parabolic function. Without any human elements, I can only describe the geometric and visual aspects of the image.

[09/06/2024 07:35:58 PM] Based on the provided data, here is a potential path that starts within the start set, ends within the goal set, and avoids the obstacles:

new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  # Start point within the start set
    (-2.5, 7.0),
    (1.0, 4.0),   # Pass through the gap between Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 4
    (5.0, 6.5)    # End point within the goal set
]

This path starts at a point within the start set, then moves up and to the right, passing through the gap between Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 4, before reaching a point within the goal set. The path avoids all the obstacles by maintaining a safe distance from them.

[09/06/2024 07:36:02 PM] Analyzing the provided path and identifying the issue with the second segment:

The initial path provided is:
path = [(-3.5, 6.5), (-2.5, 7.0), (1.0, 4.0), (5.0, 6.5)]

The feedback indicates that the segment between the second and third waypoints, (-2.5, 7.0) and (1.0, 4.0), intersects with Obstacle 7 defined by the coordinates [[0.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 6.0], [0.0, 6.0]].

To avoid this obstacle, we need to modify the path to find a route that does not intersect with any obstacles while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set.

Thought process:
1. Examine the spatial relationship between the obstacles and the proposed path.
2. Identify the problematic segment that intersects with Obstacle 7.
3. Adjust the path to avoid this obstacle by adding additional waypoints that allow the path to navigate around it.

Revised path:
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5), # Start in the start set
    (-2.5, 6.0), # Move towards the top of the start set to avoid Obstacle 7
    (-1.0, 5.0), # Move diagonally upwards and to the right to clear Obstacle 7
    (1.0, 3.0), # Move downwards to avoid Obstacle 3
    (5.0, 6.0)  # End in the goal set
]

This revised path avoids all obstacles by adding additional waypoints that guide the path around the problematic areas. The first two waypoints move the path upwards to clear Obstacle 7, the third waypoint moves the path diagonally to the right to continue avoiding obstacles, and the fourth waypoint moves the path downwards to reach the goal set.
