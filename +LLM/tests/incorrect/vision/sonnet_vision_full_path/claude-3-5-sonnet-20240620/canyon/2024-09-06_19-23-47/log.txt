# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

[09/06/2024 07:23:49 PM] Based on the provided information, here is a potential path that starts within the start set, ends within the goal set, and avoids the obstacles:

new_path = [
    (-0.15, 0.87), # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 2.0),    
    (2.0, 2.5),
    (3.15, 2.87)   # End within the goal set
]

This path avoids the obstacles by first moving up and to the right, passing between the two obstacles, and then moving diagonally to reach the goal set. The waypoints are chosen to keep a safe distance from the obstacles while still connecting the start and goal sets.

[09/06/2024 07:23:53 PM] Based on the feedback provided, it seems that the original path you generated intersects with the obstacles, which is not allowed. Let's analyze the spatial relationships between the path and the obstacles, and adjust the path accordingly.

The first segment from (-0.15, 0.87) to (0.5, 2.0) intersects with Obstacle 1. To avoid this, we can add an additional waypoint to move the path around the obstacle.

The second segment from (0.5, 2.0) to (2.0, 2.5) also intersects with Obstacle 1. Again, we need to add a waypoint to navigate around the obstacle.

The third segment from (2.0, 2.5) to (3.15, 2.87) intersects with Obstacle 1 as well. We'll need to modify this part of the path too.

Here's the adjusted path that avoids all the obstacles:

new_path = [
    (-0.15, 0.87), # Start in the start set
    (0.5, 1.0), # Move up to avoid Obstacle 1
    (2.0, 2.0), # Move diagonally to avoid Obstacle 1
    (3.0, 2.75), # Move up to avoid Obstacle 1
    (3.15, 2.87) # End in the goal set
]

The key changes I made:
1. Added an intermediate waypoint at (0.5, 1.0) to move the path up and avoid the first obstacle.
2. Added an intermediate waypoint at (2.0, 2.0) to move the path diagonally and avoid the first obstacle.
3. Added an intermediate waypoint at (3.0, 2.75) to move the path up and avoid the first obstacle.

This new path should now successfully navigate around all the obstacles and start within the start set and end within the goal set.
