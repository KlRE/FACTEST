# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.0, 1.0], [8.0, 1.0], [8.0, -0.0], [9.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/06/2024 09:06:58 PM] Given the provided information about the start and goal positions, as well as the obstacle, I propose the following waypoints for the path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), # Start within the start set quadrilateral
    (1.0, -0.0), # Move downwards along the left edge of the obstacle 
    (7.0, -0.0), # Move rightwards along the bottom edge of the obstacle
    (8.0, 0.5)  # Move upwards to end within the goal set quadrilateral
]

This path starts at the bottom-left corner of the start set, moves along the left side of the obstacle, then along the bottom, and finally up to the goal set, avoiding the obstacle completely. By keeping a safe distance from the obstacle and connecting the waypoints linearly, this path satisfies the requirements of starting within the start set, ending within the goal set, and not intersecting the obstacle.

[09/06/2024 09:07:01 PM] Let's analyze the provided path and modify it to avoid intersecting with the obstacle.

The initial path was: [(1.0, 1.0), (1.0, -0.0), (7.0, -0.0), (8.0, 0.5)]

The issue is with the segment between the second and third waypoints, (1.0, -0.0) and (7.0, -0.0), which intersects with Obstacle 1 defined by the coordinates [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]].

To avoid this obstacle, we can modify the path by adding an additional waypoint to go around the obstacle. The new path would be:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start in the start set
    (1.0, 0.0),  # Move up slightly to avoid the obstacle
    (5.0, 0.0),  # Move horizontally to the right, avoiding the obstacle
    (8.0, 0.5)   # End in the goal set
]

By adding the waypoint (1.0, 0.0) and (5.0, 0.0), the path now goes around the obstacle without intersecting it. The new path starts in the start set, avoids the obstacle, and ends in the goal set as required.

[09/06/2024 09:07:05 PM] HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[09/06/2024 09:07:05 PM] Analyzing the provided path and obstacles, I see that the path intersects with the obstacle at two segments:

1. The segment between (1.0, 0.0) and (5.0, 0.0) intersects with Obstacle 1 defined by the coordinates [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]].
2. The segment between (5.0, 0.0) and (8.0, 0.5) also intersects with the same Obstacle 1.

To avoid these obstacles, I will modify the path to guide it around the obstacle. The key is to find a path that goes above or below the obstacle while still starting within the start set and ending within the goal set.

Proposed new path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), # Start in the start set
    (1.0, 2.0), # Climb up to get above the obstacle
    (4.0, 2.0), # Move horizontally to align with the gap in the obstacle
    (4.0, 0.5), # Descend down to the goal set
    (8.0, 0.5)  # End in the goal set
]

This new path avoids intersecting with the obstacle by:
1. Starting at (1.0, 1.0) in the start set
2. Climbing up to (1.0, 2.0) to get above the obstacle
3. Moving horizontally to (4.0, 2.0) to align with the gap in the obstacle
4. Descending down to (4.0, 0.5) to enter the goal set
5. Ending at (8.0, 0.5) within the goal set

The key steps are to identify the obstacle location and adjust the path to go above or below it, while still satisfying the start and goal set requirements. Let me know if this new path looks good or if you have any other feedback!

[09/06/2024 09:07:07 PM] Analyzing the provided path and the obstacles, I can see that the segment between the waypoints (4.0, 0.5) and (8.0, 0.5) intersects with Obstacle 1, which is not allowed. To avoid this obstacle, I will modify the path by adding additional waypoints to navigate around it.

The thought process is as follows:
1. The start set is correct, so I will keep the first two waypoints as (1.0, 1.0) and (1.0, 2.0).
2. To avoid Obstacle 1, I will move the next waypoint upwards to (4.0, 3.0), which will take the path above the obstacle.
3. From there, I can descend down to (4.0, 0.5) to reach the goal set.
4. The final waypoint at (8.0, 0.5) is still within the goal set, so I will keep that.

The new path that avoids the obstacle is:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (1.0, 2.0),
    (4.0, 3.0),
    (4.0, 0.5),
    (8.0, 0.5)
]

This path starts in the start set, navigates around Obstacle 1, and ends in the goal set without intersecting any obstacles.

[09/06/2024 09:07:11 PM] Understood. Let's analyze the provided path and explore ways to modify it to avoid the obstacle while still meeting the path requirements.

The initial path was:
path = [(1.0, 1.0), (1.0, 2.0), (4.0, 3.0), (4.0, 0.5), (8.0, 0.5)]

The issue is that the segment between (4.0, 0.5) and (8.0, 0.5) intersects with Obstacle 1, which is defined by the coordinates [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]].

To avoid this obstacle, we can modify the path by adding an additional waypoint to go around the obstacle. Let's consider the following revised path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), # Start in the start set
    (1.0, 2.0),
    (4.0, 3.0),
    (4.0, 1.0), # Adjust the y-coordinate to go above the obstacle
    (6.5, 1.0), # Add a waypoint to the right of the obstacle
    (8.0, 0.5) # End in the goal set
]

This new path avoids the obstacle by going above it and then moving to the right to reach the goal set. The key steps are:

1. Start in the start set at (1.0, 1.0).
2. Move up to (1.0, 2.0) to gain some altitude.
3. Continue to (4.0, 3.0) while maintaining the altitude.
4. Adjust the y-coordinate to (4.0, 1.0) to go above the obstacle.
5. Add a waypoint at (6.5, 1.0) to the right of the obstacle.
6. Finally, move to the goal set at (8.0, 0.5).

By modifying the path in this way, we can ensure that the path avoids the obstacle and meets the path requirements.

[09/06/2024 09:07:14 PM] Based on the provided path and the feedback, it seems that the path intersects with Obstacle 1, specifically the segment between the points (4.0, 1.0) and (6.5, 1.0). To avoid this obstacle, we need to modify the path to go around it.

Here's my thought process and the adjusted path:

1. The start set is correctly located at the bottom left, and the goal set is correctly located at the top right.
2. Obstacle 1 is a large quadrilateral obstacle that spans the middle of the environment.
3. The original path tries to go directly from (4.0, 1.0) to (6.5, 1.0), which intersects with Obstacle 1.
4. To avoid the obstacle, we need to add additional waypoints to the path that will guide it around the obstacle.
5. One possible solution is to add a waypoint at (4.0, 3.0) to go over the top of the obstacle, then a waypoint at (6.5, 3.0) to move back towards the goal set.
6. This creates a path that goes from the start set, up and over the obstacle, and then down towards the goal set.

The new path would be:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (1.0, 2.0),
    (4.0, 3.0),
    (6.5, 3.0),
    (8.0, 0.5)
]

This path avoids intersecting with Obstacle 1 and connects the start set to the goal set. The waypoints are arranged to guide the path around the obstacle while maintaining a safe distance.

[09/06/2024 09:07:17 PM] HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[09/06/2024 09:07:17 PM] After analyzing the provided path and the obstacles in the environment, I have identified a few issues with the current path that need to be addressed. Let me walk through my thought process step-by-step:

1. The first segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (1.0, 2.0) is valid and does not intersect any obstacles.

2. The second segment from (1.0, 2.0) to (4.0, 3.0) appears to be clear of obstacles as well.

3. However, the third segment from (4.0, 3.0) to (6.5, 3.0) intersects with Obstacle 1, which is defined by the coordinates [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]. This segment needs to be adjusted to avoid the obstacle.

4. Similarly, the fourth segment from (6.5, 3.0) to (8.0, 0.5) also intersects with Obstacle 1. This segment needs to be modified as well.

To address these issues and avoid the obstacles, I propose the following revised path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), # start in the start set
    (1.0, 2.0),
    (4.0, 3.0),
    (4.0, 0.0), # adjust the path to go below Obstacle 1
    (7.0, 0.0), # move horizontally to the right to reach the goal set
    (8.0, 0.5) # end in the goal set
]

The key changes in this new path are:
- Adding a waypoint at (4.0, 0.0) to move the path below Obstacle 1 and avoid intersecting it.

[09/06/2024 09:07:21 PM] HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[09/06/2024 09:07:21 PM] Here is my analysis and the corrected path:

Upon closer examination of the obstacles, I see that the original path intersects with Obstacle 1 in two segments. Specifically, the segment between (4.0, 3.0) and (4.0, 0.0), as well as the segment between (4.0, 0.0) and (7.0, 0.0) both cross through Obstacle 1.

To avoid these obstacle intersections, I will modify the path to go around Obstacle 1 instead of cutting through the middle. The key is to identify a route that passes safely between the obstacles.

Looking at the layout, I see there is an open space or "gap" between the top of Obstacle 1 and the bottom of the goal set. By adding some additional waypoints, I can guide the path up and around Obstacle 1 while still reaching the goal set.

The new corrected path is:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start in the start set
    (1.0, 3.0),  # Move up and to the right to approach the gap
    (5.0, 3.0),  # Continue moving horizontally to reach the gap
    (5.0, 0.5),  # Move down slightly to enter the goal set
    (8.0, 0.5)   # Final waypoint inside the goal set
]

This path avoids intersecting with any of the obstacles by navigating around Obstacle 1 through the available gap. It starts within the start set, ends within the goal set, and the linear segments connecting the waypoints do not cross any obstacles.

[09/06/2024 09:07:25 PM] Based on the feedback provided, it seems there are two main issues with the original path:

1. Segment 3 between points (5.0, 3.0) and (5.0, 0.5) intersects with Obstacle 1.
2. Segment 4 between points (5.0, 0.5) and (8.0, 0.5) also intersects with Obstacle 1.

To address these issues, we need to adjust the path to avoid intersecting with the obstacle.

Here's my thought process and the updated path:

1. The original path goes directly through the middle of the obstacle, which is not feasible. We need to find a way to go around the obstacle.
2. Looking at the shape of the obstacle, it appears to have a triangular shape with the top vertex at (6.0, 4.0) and the bottom vertices at (2.0, -4.0) and (3.0, -4.0).
3. To avoid this obstacle, we can add an additional waypoint at the top left corner of the obstacle, at around (2.0, 3.0). This will allow us to go around the obstacle from the top.
4. From the top left corner, we can then move to the right towards the goal set, while staying above the obstacle.
5. The final path should look like this:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (1.0, 3.0),
    (2.0, 3.0),
    (7.0, 0.5),
    (8.0, 0.5)
]

This new path starts in the start set, goes around the obstacle by adding a waypoint at the top left corner, and then moves towards the goal set, avoiding any intersection with the obstacle.

[09/06/2024 09:07:28 PM] Based on the provided feedback, the original path intersects with Obstacle 1, so I will need to adjust the path to avoid this obstacle. Here's my thought process and the new path:

The main issue is with the segment between the points (2.0, 3.0) and (7.0, 0.5), as this intersects with Obstacle 1. To avoid this, I will need to add an additional waypoint that allows the path to go around the obstacle.

Looking at the obstacle coordinates, it appears that the obstacle is a diagonal line from (6.0, 4.0) to (3.0, -4.0). To avoid this, I can add a waypoint at (3.5, 1.0), which will allow the path to go above the obstacle.

The new path would be:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (1.0, 3.0), 
    (3.5, 1.0),
    (7.0, 0.5),
    (8.0, 0.5)
]

This new path starts in the start set, goes up to (1.0, 3.0), then moves diagonally to (3.5, 1.0) to go above the obstacle, and then continues to the goal set while avoiding the obstacle.

The key changes were:
1. Adding the waypoint at (3.5, 1.0) to go around the obstacle.
2. Ensuring that the segments between the waypoints do not intersect with the obstacle.

[09/06/2024 09:07:31 PM] Based on the provided feedback, it seems that the original path you generated has an issue with obstacle avoidance. The segment between the waypoints (3.5, 1.0) and (7.0, 0.5) intersects with Obstacle 1. To address this, we need to modify the path to avoid this obstacle.

Here's my thought process and the changes I would make to the path:

1. The start point (1.0, 1.0) is within the start set, which is correct.
2. The first segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (1.0, 3.0) is clear of obstacles.
3. The second segment from (1.0, 3.0) to (3.5, 1.0) is also clear of obstacles.
4. However, the third segment from (3.5, 1.0) to (7.0, 0.5) intersects with Obstacle 1, which is not allowed.
5. To avoid this obstacle, we can add an additional waypoint that would allow the path to go around the obstacle.
6. A possible new waypoint could be (5.0, 2.0), which would allow the path to go around the obstacle.
7. The final path would then be:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (1.0, 3.0),
    (3.5, 1.0),
    (5.0, 2.0),
    (7.0, 0.5),
    (8.0, 0.5)
]

This new path starts in the start set, avoids the obstacle, and ends in the goal set. The additional waypoint at (5.0, 2.0) ensures that the path does not intersect with Obstacle 1.

[09/06/2024 09:07:34 PM] HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[09/06/2024 09:07:34 PM] Upon analyzing the provided path and the obstacles, I see that the path intersects with Obstacle 1 in two segments - between waypoints (3.5, 1.0) and (5.0, 2.0), and between waypoints (5.0, 2.0) and (7.0, 0.5). To avoid these intersections and ensure the path does not cross any obstacles, I will modify the path to go around the obstacle.

The new path I propose is as follows:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), # start in the start set
    (1.0, 3.0), # move upwards to get above the obstacle
    (3.0, 3.0), # move rightwards to reach the clear region above the obstacle
    (5.0, 1.0), # move downwards to get below the obstacle
    (7.0, 1.0), # move rightwards to the goal set
    (8.0, 0.5) # end in the goal set
]

The key changes I made are:

1. Added a waypoint at (1.0, 3.0) to move the path upwards and get above Obstacle 1.
2. Added a waypoint at (3.0, 3.0) to continue moving the path rightwards in the clear region above the obstacle.
3. Added a waypoint at (5.0, 1.0) to move the path downwards and get below the obstacle.
4. Added a waypoint at (7.0, 1.0) to continue moving the path rightwards towards the goal set.

By making these adjustments, the new path successfully avoids intersecting with any of the obstacles and still starts in the start set and ends in the goal set. The path now satisfies all the requirements.

[09/06/2024 09:07:37 PM] Understood. Here is my analysis and revised path that avoids the obstacles:

The initial path provided intersects with Obstacle 1 in two segments - between the waypoints (3.0, 3.0) and (5.0, 1.0), as well as between (5.0, 1.0) and (7.0, 1.0). To avoid these obstacle intersections, I will modify the path as follows:

1. Start the path at the bottom-left corner of the start set quadrilateral at (1.0, 1.0).
2. Move the path upwards to (1.0, 3.0) to clear the top of Obstacle 1.
3. Turn the path to the right and move to (3.0, 3.0) to reach the gap between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2.
4. Continue the path to the right, passing through the gap and reaching (7.0, 3.0).
5. Finally, turn the path downwards and end at (8.0, 0.5) within the goal set quadrilateral.

The revised path is:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (1.0, 3.0), 
    (3.0, 3.0),
    (7.0, 3.0),
    (8.0, 0.5)
]

This path avoids intersecting with any of the obstacles and starts within the start set quadrilateral and ends within the goal set quadrilateral.

[09/06/2024 09:07:40 PM] Analyzing the provided path and the obstacles, I can see that the path segment between the waypoints (3.0, 3.0) and (7.0, 3.0) intersects with Obstacle 1. To avoid this obstacle, I will need to modify the path.

My thought process is as follows:

1. The start set and end set are both correct, so I don't need to change the start and end points.
2. To avoid the obstacle, I will need to add an additional waypoint that allows the path to go around the obstacle.
3. Looking at the shape of the obstacle, it seems like the best approach would be to go above the obstacle, since there is more clearance on the top side.
4. I can add a waypoint at (5.0, 5.0) to guide the path up and over the obstacle.

The new path with the added waypoint would be:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (1.0, 3.0),
    (3.0, 3.0),
    (5.0, 5.0),
    (7.0, 3.0),
    (8.0, 0.5)
]

This new path starts in the start set, avoids the obstacle by going above it, and ends in the goal set, without intersecting any obstacles.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.0, 1.0], [8.0, 1.0], [8.0, -0.0], [9.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]

    
## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.0, 1.0), (1.0, 3.0), (3.0, 3.0), (5.0, 5.0), (7.0, 3.0), (8.0, 0.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    Obstacle Avoidance (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
		Segment 4 between points (5.0, 5.0) and (7.0, 3.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

[09/06/2024 09:07:43 PM] To address the issue with the original path, let's analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and plan a new path that avoids intersecting with them.

Looking at the provided information, the path segment between the waypoints (5.0, 5.0) and (7.0, 3.0) intersects with Obstacle 1, which is defined by the vertices [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]. This is the problematic segment that needs to be adjusted.

To avoid this obstacle, we can add an additional waypoint that takes the path around the obstacle. The new path could look like this:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0), # Start in the start set
    (1.0, 3.0), # Move upwards
    (3.0, 3.0), # Move rightwards
    (5.0, 5.0), # Move upwards
    (7.0, 5.0), # Move rightwards, avoiding Obstacle 1
    (8.0, 0.5) # Move downwards to end in the goal set
]

Here's the thought process behind the new path:

1. The path starts at (1.0, 1.0), which is within the start set.
2. It then moves to (1.0, 3.0) and (3.0, 3.0) to gain some height and move towards the goal set.
3. At (5.0, 5.0), the path could intersect with Obstacle 1 if it continued in a straight line to (7.0, 3.0). To avoid this, we add a new waypoint at (7.0, 5.0), which allows the path to move around the obstacle.
4. Finally, the path moves downwards to (8.0, 0.5), which is within the goal set.

This new path should avoid intersecting with any obstacles while still starting within the start set and ending within the goal set.
