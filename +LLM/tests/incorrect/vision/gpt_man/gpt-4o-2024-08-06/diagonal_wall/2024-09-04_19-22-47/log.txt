# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

[09/04/2024 07:22:54 PM] ## Path Planning

### Environment Analysis
- The start position is a small square in the lower left.
- The goal position is a small square in the upper right.
- There are two obstacles, one large diamond shape in the center and another quadrilateral at the bottom.

### Path Strategy
1. **Starting Point:** Begin from within the start set, such as (0.5, 0.5).
2. **Avoid Edge:** Move upwards toward the breakpoint to bypass the lower obstacle.
3. **Navigate Around Central Obstacle:** Head toward the first breakpoint, ensuring clearance from the central obstacle.
4. **Finish in Goal:** Move towards the goal after clearing the obstacles.

### Chosen Path
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (2.0, -2.5),   # First breakpoint
    (4.5, 4.5),    # Finish in the goal set
]
```

- **Waypoint 1:** (0.5, 0.5) starts within the start area.
- **Waypoint 2:** (2.0, -2.5) on the selected breakpoint to ensure passing through at least one breakpoint.
- **Waypoint 3:** (4.5, 4.5) within the goal area.

The planned path ensures a safe route avoiding the obstacles while satisfying all task requirements.

[09/04/2024 07:23:03 PM] ### Thought Process

1. **Starting and Ending:** The path starts correctly within the start set and ends within the goal set.

2. **Obstacle 2 Intersection:** The current segment from (2.0, -2.5) to (4.5, 4.5) intersects with Obstacle 2, which is defined by vertices at [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]].

3. **Plan for Adjustment:**
   - The initial valid segment [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, -2.5)] does not intersect any obstacle. This will be the starting point for the adjusted path.
   - To avoid intersecting with Obstacle 2, the path will need to move around it.

4. **Adding Waypoints:**
   - From (2.0, -2.5), move towards a safe edge near the obstacle, possibly upwards, then change direction after passing the obstacle.

### Path Adjustment

1. **Start Movement:** Begin at the starting point (0.5, 0.5).

2. **Move to a Breakpoint:** Move to a breakpoint that allows a valid starting path without immediate collision:
   - From (0.5, 0.5) to (2.0, -2.5).

3. **Navigate Around the Obstacle:**
   - From (2.0, -2.5), move upward toward a safe intermediate waypoint beyond the reach of the obstacle, for example, (3.0, 2.0).
   - This point is chosen to avoid collisions with Obstacle 2 by moving outside the obstacle perimeter.

4. **Reach the Goal:**
   - Finally, move from (3.0, 2.0) directly to (4.5, 4.5) in the goal area while avoiding any further intersections.

### New Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (2.0, -2.5),
    (3.0, 2.0),
    (4.5, 4.5)
]
```

This path ensures starting and ending in the correct areas while effectively avoiding obstacle intersections.

[09/04/2024 07:23:12 PM] ### Analysis

1. **Start and Goal Sets**: The initial and final waypoints are correctly positioned within the start and goal areas.

2. **Obstacle Interaction**: The path segment between `(2.0, -2.5)` and `(3.0, 2.0)` crosses Obstacle 2, so adjustments are required to navigate around this obstacle.

3. **Breakpoints**: The path needs to pass through a defined breakpoint. Since it already goes through `(2.0, -2.5)`, we can keep this point in mind for adjustments.

### Path Adjustments

- The path from `(0.5, 0.5)` to `(2.0, -2.5)` is valid, so we'll retain this segment.
- To avoid Obstacle 2, we should find a detour that either goes around it or takes advantage of the breakpoints more effectively.

### New Path Planning

Considering the spatial layout and the position of Obstacle 2:

1. Start at `(0.5, 0.5)`.
2. Move to the breakpoint `(2.0, -2.5)`.
3. Instead of going to `(3.0, 2.0)`, adjust the path to skirt around the obstacle:
   - Move slightly left and up to `(1.5, 1.0)`.
   - Continue upwards to `(2.5, 3.5)`, ensuring to bypass the obstacle and head towards the goal.
4. From there, go directly to `(4.5, 4.5)` without intersecting any obstacles, heading into the goal set.

### New Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (2.0, -2.5),   # Pass through a breakpoint
    (1.5, 1.0),    # Navigate around Obstacle 2
    (2.5, 3.5),    # Further move towards the goal bypassing the obstacle
    (4.5, 4.5)     # End within the goal set
]
```

This revised path maintains adherence to the path requirements and avoids crossing any obstacles.

[09/04/2024 07:23:20 PM] ### Analysis and Thought Process:

1. **Understanding the Environment:**
   - **Start Set:** Located at (0.5, 0.5) within the defined quadrilateral.
   - **Goal Set:** Targeted at (4.5, 4.5) within the specified goal area.
   - **Obstacles:**
     - **Obstacle 1** lies off to the right and does not intersect our valid partial path.
     - **Obstacle 2** forms a diamond shape and extends near the direction needed to reach the goal set.

2. **Reviewing the Initial Path:**
   - The initial valid path extends from (0.5, 0.5) to (2.0, -2.5).
   - The segment from (2.0, -2.5) to (1.5, 1.0) crosses Obstacle 2.

3. **Obstacle Avoidance:**
   - The key is to navigate around Obstacle 2 while adhering to the constraints.
   - We should modify the path to pass over or under Obstacle 2 without intersection.

4. **Path Adjustment Strategy:**
   - Since the segment from (2.0, -2.5) towards (1.5, 1.0) cuts through Obstacle 2, change the waypoint to avoid this inclusion.
   - Given the shape of Obstacle 2, attempt an upward shift to bypass it.

### Proposed New Path:

Starting from the valid subpath, adjust away from intersecting Obstacle 2:

- **Initial Valid Path:**
  - (0.5, 0.5) to (2.0, -2.5)

- **Path Adjustment:**
  1. Move upwards above Obstacle 2.
     - New Waypoint: (2.0, 1.0)

  2. Move diagonally upward-right to get closer to the goal set.
     - New Waypoint: (3.5, 4.5)

  3. Directly to the goal set.
     - New Waypoint: (4.5, 4.5)

### Final Path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (2.0, -2.5),
    (2.0, 1.0),
    (3.5, 4.5),
    (4.5, 4.5)
]
```

This path starts correctly, avoids intersections, and ends within the goal set, ensuring completion of the task while maintaining a safety distance from obstacles.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

[09/04/2024 07:23:26 PM] ## Analysis and Thought Process

1. **Initial Assessment:**
   - The start position is correctly chosen within the blue quadrilateral.
   - The path must pass through one of the breakpoints provided in Set 1: \((2.0, -2.5)\) (already included) or \((2.0, 5.5)\).

2. **Issue Identification:**
   - The original path's segment from \((2.0, -2.5)\) to \((2.0, 1.0)\) intersects with Obstacle 2.

3. **Goal:**
   - Adjust the path to avoid the obstacle while still going through the designated breakpoints and ending in the goal area.

4. **Environment and Obstacle Spatial Relationships:**
   - Obstacle 2's vertices are \([[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]]\).
   - There is an available space to navigate around Obstacle 2 by bypassing its edges.

5. **Proposed Path Adjustments:**
   - Begin from the valid subpath: \((0.5, 0.5)\) to \((2.0, -2.5)\).
   - Instead of going upwards directly to \((2.0, 1.0)\), redirect to the second breakpoint \((2.0, 5.5)\) to avoid crossing the obstacle.
   - From \((2.0, 5.5)\), adjust direction towards the goal with intermediate waypoints that skirt around the outer part of Obstacle 2.

## New Path:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),       # Start inside the start set
    (2.0, -2.5),      # Breakpoint Set 1
    (1.5, 3.0),       # Navigate around the bottom of Obstacle 2
    (2.0, 5.5),       # Second Breakpoint Set 1 (alternative path to avoid Obstacle 2)
    (4.5, 4.5)        # End inside the goal set
]
```

This new path carefully avoids crossing obstacles by utilizing available gaps and flying over the allowed breakpoints, ensuring compliance with the task's requirements.

[09/04/2024 07:23:34 PM] To create a valid path from the start position to the goal position while avoiding obstacles, we need to adjust the path to ensure no segments intersect with the obstacles. Let's analyze the current path and how it intersects:

### Current Path Analysis
1. **Initial Start to Breakpoint:**
   - The path starts from **(0.5, 0.5)** and goes to the first breakpoint **(2.0, -2.5)**. This segment does not intersect any obstacles, so it's valid.

2. **Second Segment Issue:**
   - From **(2.0, -2.5)** to **(1.5, 3.0)**, the path crosses Obstacle 2. We need to avoid this intersection by choosing an alternative route.

3. **Continuation and Final Goal Segment:**
   - The segment **(2.0, 5.5)** to **(4.5, 4.5)** is valid as it ends within the goal area.

### Path Adjustment Strategy
To correct the path, let's try redirecting the problematic segment to circumvent Obstacle 2 and ensure the path passes through a valid breakpoint.

### New Path Construction
- **Start at (0.5, 0.5):** A valid start point within the start position.
- Move to **(2.0, -2.5):** A valid breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1.
- Adjust to **(3.0, -1.0):** Navigate around Obstacle 2 by staying below it.
- Go to **(3.5, 3.5):** Bypass the central area without crossing obstacles.
- Move to **(2.0, 5.5):** Another valid breakpoint ensuring path passes through Breakpoint Set 2 without intersection.
- End at **(4.5, 4.5):** A valid endpoint within the goal area.

### Final Path
Let's summarize the adjusted path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start point within the start set
    (2.0, -2.5),  # Valid breakpoint to bypass initial segment
    (3.0, -1.0),  # Navigate around the bottom of Obstacle 2
    (3.5, 3.5),   # Bypass the central area clear of obstacles
    (2.0, 5.5),   # Reach the other breakpoint set without crossing obstacles
    (4.5, 4.5)    # End point within the goal set
]
```

This path ensures we avoid intersections with obstacles while adhering to the constraints, such as passing through the required breakpoints.

    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data

[09/04/2024 07:23:42 PM] ### Analysis

1. **Given Path Details**: The path starts correctly within the start set and ends correctly within the goal set. The feedback highlighted that the segment between points (3.0, -1.0) and (3.5, 3.5) intersects Obstacle 2.

2. **Obstacle 2**: This obstacle appears to have a diagonal orientation which could cause intersections with straight-line paths not carefully planned.

3. **Current Valid Subpath**: The valid path so far runs from (0.5, 0.5) to (3.0, -1.0). This subpath needs to be extended without hitting the obstacles.

4. **Breakpoints and Adjustments**: We need to incorporate breakpoint (2.0, 5.5) effectively, ensuring the path eventually meets this requirement.

### Path Adjustments

To avoid intersecting with Obstacle 2, let's adjust the path after the valid subpath:

1. After reaching (3.0, -1.0), adjust the path to move around the obstacle. 

2. **New Waypoints**:
   - From (3.0, -1.0), divert the path upwards along the y-axis towards (3.0, 1.5) to navigate around the lower portion of Obstacle 2.
   - Next, proceed horizontally to (4.0, 1.5), avoiding the right side of the obstacle.
   - Move up to (4.0, 3.0) to ensure a clear path toward the goal.
   - Proceed to the breakpoint (2.0, 5.5).
   - Finally, reach the goal set at (4.5, 4.5).

### New Path

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start within the start set
    (2.0, -2.5),  # Valid breakpoint
    (3.0, -1.0),  # Closest valid point before needing adjustment
    (3.0, 1.5),   # Diversion upwards
    (4.0, 1.5),   # Rightward motion to avoid the obstacle
    (4.0, 3.0),   # Moving up to clear any further intersection
    (2.0, 5.5),   # Passing through the required breakpoint
    (4.5, 4.5)    # Ending within the goal set
]

These adjustments ensure the path navigates around the obstacle efficiently while meeting all requirements, including the passage through breakpoints.

[09/04/2024 07:23:53 PM] ### Analysis and Path Adjustment

1. **Initial Path Review**: The original path starts correctly but intersects with Obstacle 2 between the points (3.0, -1.0) and (3.0, 1.5).

2. **Valid Subpath**: The valid part of the path is [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, -2.5), (3.0, -1.0)]. Since it ends before the intersection, we can adjust from this endpoint.

3. **Obstacle Analysis**:
   - **Obstacle 1** (bottom right) is clear from the valid segment.
   - **Obstacle 2** (large central diamond) requires careful maneuvering to avoid intersecting.

4. **Path Adjustment Strategy**:
   - From (3.0, -1.0), veer right to avoid Obstacle 2 by going around the bottom.
   - Use the bottom of the obstacle to guide a safe path upwards.

5. **Updated Waypoints**:
   - From (3.0, -1.0), head to (3.5, -1.5) to bypass the bottom corner of Obstacle 2.
   - Proceed to (5.5, 1.0) to safely clear the right side and rise to the level of the goal area.
   - Continue to (4.5, 4.0) to approach the goal from below.
   - Finally, end at (4.5, 4.5) in the goal area.

### New Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),       # Start inside start set
    (2.0, -2.5),      # Valid breakpoint from previous path
    (3.0, -1.0),      # End of valid subpath
    (3.5, -1.5),      # Avoid bottom of Obstacle 2
    (5.5, 1.0),       # Navigate around the right of Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.0),       # Approach the goal set from below
    (4.5, 4.5)        # End in the goal set

This revised path avoids all obstacles, successfully navigates from the start to the goal, and passes through necessary breakpoints, ensuring compliance with the task requirements.

[09/04/2024 07:24:01 PM] ## Analysis and Path Correction

### Observations
1. **Start:** The path correctly starts within the start set.
2. **End:** The path also correctly ends inside the goal set.
3. **Obstacle Interaction:** The segment from (3.5, -1.5) to (5.5, 1.0) intersects with obstacle 1, which we need to avoid.
4. **Breakpoints:** The current path passes through the breakpoint (2.0, -2.5) as required.

### Adjustments Needed
- We need to adjust the segment that intersects with obstacle 1 while ensuring the path still reaches the goal.
- Consider navigating around obstacle 1 after reaching (3.5, -1.5).

### Path Adjustment Strategy
1. **Avoiding Obstacle 1:** Instead of moving from (3.5, -1.5) to (5.5, 1.0), we should add a waypoint that helps bypass the obstacle safely.
   
2. **New Path Planning:**
   - Start at (0.5, 0.5)
   - Move to breakpoint (2.0, -2.5)
   - Move to (3.0, -1.0)
   - Add a new waypoint around the obstacle, possibly (4.0, -1.5), to go around the lower side.
   - Continue to (4.5, 1.0) to move clear of obstacles.
   - Move towards the goal with final adjustments keeping clear of any other obstacles.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, -2.5), (3.0, -1.0), (4.0, -1.5), (4.5, 4.0), (4.5, 4.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 3 between points (3.0, -1.0) and (4.0, -1.5) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, -2.5), (3.0, -1.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]

[09/04/2024 07:24:11 PM] ### Analysis

- **Start and Goal Positions:**
  - The start set is in the bottom left, and the goal set is in the top right of the environment.
  - The current path correctly starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.

- **Obstacles:**
  - Obstacle 1 is located to the bottom right.
  - Obstacle 2 extends diagonally from the bottom left to the top right, spanning across much of the space between the start and goal.

- **Current Path and Issue:**
  - The original path intersects with Obstacle 1 between waypoints (3.0, -1.0) and (4.0, -1.5).
  - Up to (3.0, -1.0) is the longest subpath that does not intersect any obstacles.

### Path Adjustments

To construct a valid path:

1. Start from within the start set at (0.5, 0.5).
2. Utilize Breakpoint Set 1 by moving to (2.0, -2.5), avoiding immediate obstacles.
3. From the valid subpath endpoint (3.0, -1.0), adjust the path to avoid Obstacle 1:
   - Move slightly upwards to (3.0, 1) to ensure clearance from Obstacle 1.
4. Proceed horizontally or slightly upwards between obstacles, aiming to reach close to the goal set:
   - Move to (4.0, 3.0) ensuring clearance.
5. End in the goal set at (4.5, 4.5).

By tracing the path around the outer edges of Obstacle 1 and keeping sufficient clearance, the path can conclude successfully in the goal set.

### New Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),       # Start in the start set
    (2.0, -2.5),      # Breakpoint 1 to avoid initial obstacles
    (3.0, 1.0),       # Adjust upward to avoid Obstacle 1
    (4.0, 3.0),       # Travel across clear space
    (4.5, 4.5)        # End in the goal set
]
```

This path maintains integrity by avoiding obstacles while satisfying the requirement to pass through a breakpoint and ending in the goal set.

[09/04/2024 07:24:19 PM] To plan a valid path, let's analyze the spatial layout and the problematic segment.

### Current Situation:
1. **Start Point:** Begins at (0.5, 0.5).
2. **Goal Point:** Ends at (4.5, 4.5), which is correct.
3. **Obstacles:** The critical intersection occurs between segment (2.0, -2.5) and (3.0, 1.0) with Obstacle 2.
4. **Breakpoints:** Path passes through (2.0, -2.5), which is valid but leads to intersection with Obstacle 2.

### Strategy:
- Since the segment between (2.0, -2.5) and (3.0, 1.0) intersects with Obstacle 2, adjust the path to detour around it while maintaining the requirement to pass through at least one breakpoint.
- Create a path that avoids Obstacle 2 by choosing a different route through available space away from it.

### Proposed Solution:
1. **Start:** Begin at (0.5, 0.5) within the start set.
2. **Avoiding the First Obstacle:** Instead of heading downward where the obstacle is, initially head more towards an open area.
3. **Detour to Avoid Obstacle 2:** 
   - Use a breakpoint (e.g., (2.0, 5.0)) located safely way around the obstacle.
   - Move towards an open area such that it safely bypasses the problematic segment.

### New Path:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start
    (1.0, 2.5),   # Move diagonally upwards avoiding initial encroachment
    (2.0, 5.5),   # Use the upper breakpoint to bypass Obstacle 2
    (4.0, 5.0),   # Head towards the goal, avoiding obstacles
    (4.5, 4.5)    # End in the goal set
]
```

### Explanation:
- By adjusting the path to pass through (2.0, 5.5) instead of (2.0, -2.5), the path avoids intersecting with Obstacle 2.
- The waypoints are selected to smoothly form a path from the start to the goal without crossing any obstacles.
- This solution keeps the path within clear areas between obstacles, ensuring a valid route.

   - **Goal Quadrilateral:** Within \((5.0, 5.0) \text{ to} (4.0, 4.0) \).
   - **Obstacles:** One obstacle spans from \((-2.0, 4.0)\) to \((5.0, 1.0)\).

3. **Breakpoints:** In this case, Breakpoint Set 1 is \((2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 5.5)\).

### Plan
- Start at a valid position within the start set.
- Choose a logical path avoiding Obstacle 2.
- Ensure the path passes through at least one breakpoint from Set 1.
- Finish the path within the goal set.

### Rerouted Path Steps

1. **Start:** \((0.5, 0.5)\), inside the start quadrilateral.
2. **Bypass the Obstacle:** Move to a point below the obstacle, ensuring to cross through \((2.0, -2.5)\) as the breakpoint from Set 1.
3. **Approach Goal:** Adjust the path towards the goal quadrilateral.

### New Path Proposal
To avoid combining through Obstacle 2:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),     # Start inside the start set
    (2.0, -2.5),    # Move towards a safe waypoint below the obstacle
    (4.0, 4.0),     # Finish within the goal set
]
```
   
### Summary
This path avoids crossing obstacles and respects the spatial constraints by safely traversing below the obstacle and using the breakpoints effectively.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, -2.5), (4.0, 4.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 2 between points (2.0, -2.5) and (4.0, 4.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 2: [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, -2.5)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

[09/04/2024 07:24:36 PM] ### Analysis and Adjustments:

1. **Current Path Evaluation**:
    - The initial path goes from (0.5, 0.5) to (2.0, -2.5), which is valid.
    - The segment from (2.0, -2.5) to (4.0, 4.0) intersects with Obstacle 2, which is problematic.

2. **Obstacle 2**:
    - Its vertices are [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]].
    - To avoid this obstacle, the path must be rerouted around it.

3. **Proposed Path Adjustment**:
    - **Step 1**: Start from (0.5, 0.5).
    - **Step 2**: Go to (2.0, -2.5) to pass through the first breakpoint.
    - **Step 3**: From (2.0, -2.5), move to (3.0, -1.0)—a point south of Obstacle 2, avoiding its boundary.
    - **Step 4**: Next, proceed to a point like (4.5, 2.5) to go around the western side of the obstacle.
    - **Step 5**: Finally, reach the goal by heading to (4.5, 4.5) inside the goal set.

4. **State of New Path**:
    - The new path avoids intersecting any obstacles.
    - It passes through one breakpoint.
    - It successfully starts inside the start quadrant and ends within the goal quadrant.

[09/04/2024 07:24:46 PM] ### Analysis and Adjustments

1. **Path Start and End:** 
   - The path correctly starts at (0.5, 0.5), which is within the start set, and ends at (4.5, 4.5), which is inside the goal set.

2. **Obstacle Analysis:**
   - The initial segments from (0.5, 0.5) to (2.0, -2.5) and (2.0, -2.5) to (3.0, -1.0) are valid.
   - The segment from (3.0, -1.0) to (4.5, 2.5) intersects with Obstacle 2.

3. **Obstacle 2 Coordinates:**
   - Obstacle 2: [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]]
   - This obstacle forms a diamond shape with vertex (3.0, -1.0) which the path tries to move through.

4. **Path Re-adjustment:**
   - To avoid the obstacle, I will re-route after the last valid waypoint (3.0, -1.0).
   - I will add a waypoint to circumvent the obstacle by moving slightly before reaching the point (4.5, 2.5).
   - This involves shifting the path upward from the last valid segment.

5. **New Waypoints:**
   - From (3.0, -1.0), move up to a new waypoint (3.5, 0.0).
   - This is clear of the obstacle and maintains a direct but cautious path towards the goal.
   - From (3.5, 0.0), move to (4.5, 2.5) and finally to (4.5, 4.5).

### New Path Proposal

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start in the start set.
    (2.0, -2.5),   # First breakpoint in set 1.
    (3.0, -1.0),   # Last valid point before obstacle interaction.
    (3.5, 0.0),    # New waypoint to avoid obstacle.
    (4.5, 2.5),    # Nearing the goal area.
    (4.5, 4.5)     # End in the goal set.
]
```

This path adjusts to avoid the intersection with the obstacle while still achieving entry and exit from the required sets.

[09/04/2024 07:24:52 PM] To adjust the path and ensure it avoids obstacles, let's analyze the existing and potential routes:

### Current Path Analysis:
1. **Initial Valid Segment:**
   - Starts at (0.5, 0.5) moving to (2.0, -2.5), which is clear of obstacles.
   - Passes through the breakpoint (2.0, -2.5).

2. **Issue Identified:**
   - The path from (3.0, -1.0) to (3.5, 0.0) intersects with Obstacle 2.

### Plan for Correction:
- **Objective:** Avoid the intersecting area with Obstacle 2 by rerouting between (3.0, -1.0) and before (3.5, 0.0).
- **Strategy:** Navigate more to the right and upwards to ensure bypassing the obstacle completely.

### New Path:
1. **Start Position:** Begin at a point inside the start set, e.g., (0.5, 0.5).
2. **Through Breakpoint:** Utilize the breakpoint (2.0, -2.5).
3. **Additional Waypoints to Avoid Obstacle:**
   - After Breakpoint: Move upward and rightward around the obstacle:
     - Consider the point (3.5, -1.5) to avoid the lower part of Obstacle 2.
     - Skirt around the obstacle from below completely.
4. **Final Approach to Goal:**
   - Pass further upward and right to reach (4.5, 4.5) in the goal set. Ensure a clear trajectory free of obstacles.
   
### Final Path:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (2.0, -2.5),
    (3.5, -1.5),  # move around the obstacle
    (3.8, 1.0),   # more rightward into clearer space
    (4.5, 4.5)    # into the goal set
]
```

### Considerations:
- The choice of waypoints is designed to ensure no crossing with Obstacle 2 and safely reach the goal.
- Maintain distances from obstacle boundaries to prevent any unintended contact.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]]

		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, -2.5), (3.5, -1.5), (3.8, 1.0), (4.5, 4.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, -2.5), (3.5, -1.5)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

[09/04/2024 07:25:01 PM] ### Analysis and Thought Process

1. **Start and End Positions**: The path starts and ends in the correct quadrilaterals. The initial waypoints are within the starting zone, and the final point is within the goal area.

2. **Obstacles and Path Crossing**: The path segment between (3.5, -1.5) and (3.8, 1.0) intersects with Obstacle 2. We need to address this by rerouting the path to avoid this intersection.

3. **Avoiding Obstacle 2**: Obstacle 2 spans a large area and its vertices suggest the need to navigate around its angular structure.

4. **Valid Subpath and Breakpoints**: The path successfully travels from the starting point to (3.5, -1.5) without collision. We need to ensure it also passes through the breakpoints where possible.

### Path Adjustments

- **Waypoint Continuation**: After reaching (3.5, -1.5), move to avoid the intersection by navigating around the upper side of Obstacle 2.
  
- **New Waypoints**: Instead of approaching (3.8, 1.0), adjust to pass through the available gap bypassing the obstacle.

### Suggested New Path

1. **Start Point**: Begin at (0.5, 0.5) within the start quadrilateral.
2. **Midway Adjustments**: Move to (2.0, -2.5), pass through a breakpoint.
3. **Navigate Upward**: From (3.5, -1.5), adjust slightly to (3.5, 2.0) to bypass the obstacle on its right side.
4. **Approaching the Goal**: Move to (4.2, 3.5), ensuring not to intersect with any other parts of the obstacle.
5. **End Point**: Conclude at (4.5, 4.5) within the goal quadrilateral.

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (2.0, -2.5),
    (3.5, -1.5),
    (3.5, 2.0),
    (4.2, 3.5),
    (4.5, 4.5)
]
```

This path revision makes sure the route stays clear of obstacles, follows valid breakpoints, and reaches the goal efficiently.

[09/04/2024 07:25:11 PM] ### Analysis

1. **Starting and Ending Points**: The start point \((0.5, 0.5)\) is correctly within the start set, and the path ends at a point \((4.5, 4.5)\) in the goal set. These are valid.

2. **Obstacle Intersection**: The issue is identified between points \((3.5, -1.5)\) and \((3.5, 2.0)\) intersecting with Obstacle 2. This requires adjustment to avoid passing through the obstacle.

3. **Valid Subpath**: The valid segment up to \((3.5, -1.5)\) needs to be extended or redirected to avoid the obstacle while still reaching the goal.

4. **Obstacle Layout**: 
   - Obstacle 1 is located away from the direct diagonal path from Start to Goal.
   - Obstacle 2 stretches upward, interfering with the current path.

### Path Adjustments

1. **Identifying Alternative Routes**:
   - Since the original attempt to move northward intersects Obstacle 2, explore routing around it to the east or west.
   - Utilize the breakpoint \((2.0, -2.5)\) to divert the path through a safer route.

2. **Propose New Waypoints**:
   - From the valid subpath endpoint \((3.5, -1.5)\), angle southeast instead of going north directly, circumvent the northwest side of Obstacle 2.
   - Gradually elevate trajectory to avoid entering the bounding box of Obstacle 2.
   - Finally redirect toward the goal set.

### Suggested New Path

```python
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),     # Start in the start set
    (2.0, -2.5),    # Through valid breakpoint in Set 1
    (3.5, -1.5),    # Up to last valid point before obstacle
    (4.0, -0.5),    # Divert east around the obstacle
    (4.5, 1.5),     # Move upwards while avoiding the obstacle
    (4.5, 4.5)      # End in the goal set
]
```

### Summary

The new path circumvents Obstacle 2 by navigating around its western side, thus avoiding intersection, while fulfilling the constraint of ending at the goal set coordinates.

[09/04/2024 07:25:19 PM] To correct the path and ensure it meets all the requirements without intersecting any obstacles, let's analyze the given setup.

### Analysis

1. **Start and Goal Set**: The path starts in the correct start set and ends correctly in the goal set.

2. **Obstacles**: 
   - **Obstacle 1**: Located near the x-axis between (6.0, 0.0) and (4.0, -2.0).
   - **Obstacle 2**: Spans a diagonal space between (-2.0, 4.0) and (5.0, 1.0).

3. **Path Segments**: The third segment from (3.5, -1.5) to (4.0, -0.5) intersects with Obstacle 1.

4. **Breakpoints**: The path originally passes through one of the breakpoints: (2.0, -2.5).

### Strategy for Correction

- **Avoid Current Intersection**: The segment between (3.5, -1.5) and (4.0, -0.5) intersects with Obstacle 1. We'll reroute around it.
- **Maintain Clearance**: Ensure the path stays clear of all obstacles, especially Obstacle 1, which is close to the initially problematic segment.

### Path Adjustment

1. **Start** at (0.5, 0.5) in the start set.
2. Go to the **first breakpoint** (2.0, -2.5).
3. From there, head **above Obstacle 2** and clear of Obstacle 1 by going to (3.0, 1.0).
4. Finally, proceed to the goal set at (4.5, 4.5).

### New Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start
    (2.0, -2.5), # Breakpoint
    (3.0, 1.0),  # Routing above Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)   # Goal
]
```

This new path should effectively avoid intersecting any obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[09/04/2024 07:25:27 PM] To correct the path and avoid obstacles, let's analyze the spatial relationships:

1. **Current Valid Path**: The path currently starts from (0.5, 0.5) and goes through the waypoint (2.0, -2.5) successfully. The line segment from (2.0, -2.5) towards (3.0, 1.0) intersects an obstacle.

2. **Adjusting the Path**:
    - **Obstacle 2 Intersection**: The segment from (2.0, -2.5) to (3.0, 1.0) crosses Obstacle 2. We need to find a way around it.
    
3. **New Path Planning**:
   - From (2.0, -2.5), instead of moving directly to (3.0, 1.0), we should find a path that skirts around the boundary of Obstacle 2.
   - We'll consider a new waypoint to redirect the path away from the obstacle, keeping in mind the need to reconnect to the goal area.

4. **Proposed Adjustment**:
   - Add a waypoint between (2.0, -2.5) and (3.0, 1.0) that bypasses the obstacle boundary.
   - Incorporate a diagonal path or more waypoints that head towards the goal without intersecting more obstacles.

5. **Proposed New Path**:
   - **Start**: (0.5, 0.5)
   - **Breakpoint**: (2.0, -2.5)
   - **Adjust around Obstacle**: Add a waypoint such as (3.0, -1.0) to steer clear.
   - **Approach Goal**: Proceed to (4.5, 4.0) to enter the goal set.

Based on this thought process, the new path will be:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (2.0, -2.5),
    (3.0, -1.0),  # Bypass obstacle
    (4.5, 4.0)   # Enter the goal area
]
```

This path starts in the start set, passes a breakpoint, avoids intersecting obstacles, and ends in the goal set.

[09/04/2024 07:25:35 PM] ## Thought Process

1. **Path Analysis**:
   - The provided path initially starts from the start set and goes via a valid breakpoint (2.0, -2.5), which is a good start.
   - The first two segments do not intersect any obstacles. However, segment 3 (from (3.0, -1.0) to (4.5, 4.0)) intersects with Obstacle 2.

2. **Obstacle Avoidance**:
   - To correct the intersection, we will add a waypoint that diverts the path away from the obstacle.
   - The valid subpath ends at (3.0, -1.0). From there, we need a waypoint that avoids the obstacle by navigating around it.

3. **New Path Planning**:
   - Start from a valid point.
   - Pass through the breakpoint Set 1 at (2.0, -2.5).
   - Avoid the obstacle by selecting waypoints that bypass Obstacle 2.
   - Ensure the path ends inside the goal set.

## New Path Proposal

Given the issues with segment 3, we will introduce a waypoint that diverts away from Obstacle 2.

new_path = [
   (0.5, 0.5),          # Start within the start set
   (2.0, -2.5),         # Valid breakpoint
   (2.5, 1.0),          # New waypoint to bypass Obstacle 2
   (4.5, 4.0)           # End within the goal set
] 

### Explanation:
- The new waypoint (2.5, 1.0) is introduced between the valid subpath and the final endpoint, ensuring the path diverts upwards and bypasses the obstacle, while still moving towards the goal.
- This new waypoint ensures that the path deviates away from Obstacle 2 at a safe distance.

    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

1. **Analyzing the Existing Path:**
   - The path starts correctly from the start set at (0.5, 0.5) and includes the breakpoint (2.0, -2.5).
   - However, the segment between (2.0, -2.5) and (2.5, 1.0) intersects with Obstacle 2.

2. **Identifying the Problem:**
   - The segment that causes an issue crosses through Obstacle 2.
   - We need an alternative waypoint to avoid intersecting with the obstacle.

3. **Solutions:**
   - To avoid Obstacle 2, we can adjust our path to bypass the intersection.
   - Introduce a new waypoint that safely detours around Obstacle 2 while ensuring we use at least one breakpoint.
   
4. **Obstacle Avoidance Strategy:**
   - Use the existing valid path up to (2.0, -2.5).
   - Instead of going toward (2.5, 1.0), adjust the route to the north of the obstacle.

### New Path:

1. Start from (0.5, 0.5), the valid starting point within the start set.
2. Move to the first breakpoint (2.0, -2.5).
3. Add a waypoint to the north of Obstacle 2, such as (3.0, 2.0), ensuring it is clear of the obstacle.
4. Move to (4.5, 4.0), ending within the goal set.

### Resulting Pathway:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start inside the start set
    (2.0, -2.5),   # Breakpoint within the start set
    (3.0, 2.0),    # New waypoint to bypass the obstacle
    (4.5, 4.0)     # End inside the goal set
]
```
