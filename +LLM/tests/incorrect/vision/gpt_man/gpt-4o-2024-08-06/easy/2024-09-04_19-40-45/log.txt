# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]

[09/04/2024 07:40:50 PM] ### Path Planning

Given the layout and requirements, here's a suggested path:

1. **Start** at the midpoint within the start set: (0.5, 0.5).

2. **Move** to a breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1, avoiding obstacles: (2.0, 1.5).

3. **Navigate** upwards and eastwards avoiding Obstacles 1 and 2: (2.5, 4.5).

4. **Head** towards the goal set, entering from the western side: (4.5, 4.5).

5. **End** at a point within the goal set: (4.5, 4.5).

### New Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Starting point
    (2.0, 1.5),    # Through breakpoint set 1
    (2.5, 4.5),    # Navigate north of obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5),    # Final approach to goal
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Ending point within the goal set
]
```

This path utilizes breakpoints effectively, avoids intersections with obstacles, and fulfills all task requirements.

[09/04/2024 07:41:01 PM] ### Analysis

1. **Start and End Points**:
   - Start point: (0.5, 0.5) in the start set is correct.
   - End point: (4.5, 4.5) in the goal set is also correct.

2. **Current Path Overview**:
   - Existing path: [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, 1.5), (2.5, 4.5), (4.5, 4.5)]
   - The path segment from (2.0, 1.5) to (2.5, 4.5) intersects with Obstacle 2.

3. **Obstacle Avoidance**:
   - To avoid the intersection with Obstacle 2, consider alternate routes to bypass it while still hitting breakpoints effectively.

### Plan Adjustment

1. **Valid Segment Continuation**:
   - Use the valid subpath up to (2.0, 1.5).

2. **Rerouting Around Obstacles**:
   - From (2.0, 1.5), move vertically or horizontally to navigate around the edges of Obstacle 2 while maintaining a safe distance.
   - Choose a path that uses one of the breakpoints effectively without crossing obstacles.

3. **Path to Goal**:
   - Once safely around the obstacle, proceed towards the goal set.

### New Path Proposal

1. **Continue from the valid subpath**:
   - Start at (0.5, 0.5).
   - Move to the first breakpoint (2.0, 1.5), as it avoids the first obstacle.

2. **Navigate around Obstacle 2**:
   - From (2.0, 1.5), move horizontally to avoid obstacles: (2.5, 1.5)
   - Move upwards parallel to the goal set to bypass Obstacle 2: (3.0, 2.5)
   - Then vertically upward to reach above Obstacle 2: (3.0, 4.0)

3. **Final segment to goal**:
   - Move directly to the goal set: (4.5, 4.5), ensuring entry from a valid angle within the goal boundaries.

### New Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (2.0, 1.5),   
    (2.5, 1.5),
    (3.0, 2.5),
    (3.0, 4.0),
    (4.5, 4.5)
]
```

This path uses strategic waypoints to navigate around obstacles and ensures entry into both the start and goal sets correctly without intersecting obstacles.

[09/04/2024 07:41:09 PM] ### Thought Process

1. **Review Original Path**: The path starts correctly in the start set and ends in the goal set. However, the segment between (2.5, 1.5) and (3.0, 2.5) intersects with Obstacle 2.

2. **Identify Breakpoints**: We need to pass through one of the breakpoints from the provided set. The selected breakpoint (2.0, 1.5) from the original path is good, but we need to adjust the path to avoid obstacles.

3. **Evaluate Obstacles**: The two obstacles are located such that the line connecting (2.5, 1.5) and (3.0, 2.5) intersects Obstacle 2. 

4. **Adjust the Path**: Since the initial subpath [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5)] is valid, let's extend it by adding a waypoint to bypass the obstacle.

5. **Plan a Valid Path Around the Obstacle**:
    - Move upwards or to the side to avoid the obstacle and connect to the goal.

### Path Adjustments

Here’s a new proposed sequence:

1. Start at (0.5, 0.5) in the start set.
2. Go to the breakpoint (2.0, 1.5) to connect to the first valid segment.
3. Add a waypoint slightly above the previous path to avoid the obstacle. Let's choose (2.5, 2.0) to add a buffer.
4. Move to (3.0, 4.0) for a clear path up and around the obstacle.
5. Finally, end at (4.5, 4.5) in the goal set.

### New Path

```python
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (2.0, 1.5),    # Valid breakpoint
    (2.5, 2.0),    # Adjustment to avoid obstacle
    (3.0, 4.0),    # Clear path up
    (4.5, 4.5)     # End within the goal set
]
```

This new path respects all requirements, avoids crossing obstacles, passes through a valid breakpoint, and starts and ends in the designated sets.

[09/04/2024 07:41:16 PM] ### Analysis and Thought Process

1. **Start Point and Goal Point:** 
    - Begin at a point within the start set, such as \( (0.5, 0.5) \).
    - End at a point within the goal set, like \( (4.5, 4.5) \).

2. **Breakpoints:**
    - We have a breakpoint \( (2.0, 1.5) \). This breakpoint is in the valid subpath from the prior attempt, but leads to an obstacle intersection when moving towards \( (2.5, 2.0) \). 
    - Consider an alternative breakpoint, \( (2.0, 5.5) \), as it can help navigate around the second obstacle.

3. **Obstacle Analysis:**
    - **Obstacle 1:** Between \( x = 2.0 \) and \( x = 4.0 \) along \( y = 1.0 \).
    - **Obstacle 2:** Between \( x = -2.0 \) and \( x = 3.0 \) along \( y = 4.0 \).

4. **Path Planning:**
   - Start from \( (0.5, 0.5) \). Move towards the breakpoint \( (2.0, 1.5) \).
   - By opting for the breakpoint \( (2.0, 5.5) \), we can avoid obstacles.

5. **New Path Adjustments:**
   - From the valid subpath endpoint \( (2.0, 1.5) \), elevate towards a more northward point \( (2.0, 5.5) \) to bypass the obstacle to the north.
   - Continue the path horizontally towards the goal while staying north of the obstacle.

### New Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),       # Start inside the start set
    (2.0, 1.5),       # Valid point from the last attempt
    (2.0, 5.5),       # New choice to navigate around the obstacles safely
    (4.5, 4.5)        # End inside the goal set
]
```

This revised path carefully circumvents the obstacles while fulfilling the requirement to use a breakpoint and finishes at the goal set.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data

[09/04/2024 07:41:23 PM] Let's analyze the environment and adjust the path to avoid collisions with obstacles.

### Initial Path Analysis
- The original path starts correctly at (0.5, 0.5).
- The path segment between (2.0, 1.5) and (2.0, 5.5) intersects with Obstacle 2.

### Obstacle Positioning
- **Obstacle 2** is placed from x=-2.0 to x=3.0 and y=2.0 to y=4.0.
- The segment (2.0, 1.5) to (2.0, 5.5) indeed crosses this obstacle vertically.

### Path Adjustment
1. **Start at** (0.5, 0.5) - within the start set.
2. **Move to the first breakpoint** at (2.0, 1.5) - keeping the initial part of the path.
3. **Avoid Obstacle 2** by moving around it:
   - Instead of going vertically upwards through the obstacle, I'll adjust to a waypoint to bypass it.
4. **Bypass Obstacle 2**: 
   - Move horizontally to the right around the obstacle, then move up once past the obstacle.
5. After bypassing, head to the final waypoint in the goal set, ensuring it ends correctly.

### New Pathway
- Start at (0.5, 0.5)
- Move to (2.0, 1.5) - reaching the first breakpoint.
- Move right to avoid the obstacle: (3.5, 1.5)
- Move up after bypassing the obstacle at a safe distance: (3.5, 5.0)
- Finally, proceed to the goal: (4.5, 4.5)

This path should avoid intersects and comply with set requirements.
