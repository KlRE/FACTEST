# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

[09/04/2024 07:05:43 PM] To create a path that satisfies the given requirements, we need to define a series of waypoints starting in the start set, passing through each breakpoint set, and ending in the goal set while avoiding any obstacles. Based on the details provided, here is a potential path:

**New Path:**
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  # Starting point within the start set
    (0.5, 3.0),   # Through the breakpoint of set 1
    (2.0, 5.0),   # Between obstacles 8 and 4
    (4.0, 6.5),   # Between obstacles 9 and Goal
    (5.5, 6.5)    # Ending point within the goal set
]
```

**Analysis:**
- **Start:** Begins inside the start quadrilateral at (-3.5, 6.5).
- **Breakpoint Set 1:** Passes through (0.5, 3.0).
- **Intermediate Waypoints:** Carefully chosen to navigate through the open spaces between the obstacles:
  - (0.5, 3.0) > (2.0, 5.0): Avoids obstacles 1, 2, and 8.
  - (2.0, 5.0) > (4.0, 6.5): Passes safely between obstacles 8 and 4.
  - (4.0, 6.5) > (5.5, 6.5): Navigates around obstacles 9 and approaches the goal set.
- **End:** Ends inside the goal quadrilateral at (5.5, 6.5).

This path ensures minimal interaction with the obstacles and respects the requirement to pass through a breakpoint from each set.

[09/04/2024 07:06:09 PM] To create a valid path that reaches the goal while avoiding obstacles, let's analyze the environment and make necessary adjustments.

### Analysis and Adjustments

1. **Starting Point**: The path begins at (-3.5, 6.5), successfully within the start set.

2. **Initial Valid Path**: The longest valid subpath is [(-3.5, 6.5), (0.5, 3.0), (2.0, 5.0)], which avoids crossing any obstacles.

3. **Obstacle Encounter**: From the point (2.0, 5.0), moving towards (4.0, 6.5) crosses Obstacle 9. Therefore, we need to divert.

4. **Bypassing Obstacle 9**:
   - Move around the lower side of Obstacle 9.
   - Integrate a waypoint that navigates beneath the obstacle while remaining in free space.

5. **Breakpoints**:
   - We utilize the breakpoint at (0.5, 3.0) successfully.
   - For the ending path, ensure a smooth entry into the goal set.

6. **Final Approach to Goal**: Adjust the final segment to enter the goal set smoothly.

### New Path Proposal

Let's create an alternate path avoiding crossing obstacles:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 3.0),   # Pass through the breakpoint
    (2.0, 5.0),   # Reach before encountering Obstacle 9
    (3.0, 7.0),   # Move upwards to bypass Obstacle 9
    (5.5, 6.5)    # End within the goal set
]
```

### Summary
This new path starts at a safe point in the start set and navigates effectively through a safe gap between obstacles, adjusting for the earlier path's collision issues with Obstacle 9, while still using the required breakpoints. The adjustments provide a seamless and obstacle-free route to the goal.

[09/04/2024 07:06:20 PM] ### Analysis

1. **Initial Valid Path Segments:**
   - The original path starts correctly within the start set and reaches the waypoint (2.0, 5.0) without crossing any obstacles, thus this portion of the path is valid.

2. **Issue Identification:**
   - The path segment from (2.0, 5.0) to (3.0, 7.0) crosses Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 9. These intersections must be resolved by adjusting the path.

3. **Breakpoints:**
   - The path correctly passes through (0.5, 3.0), which is a valid breakpoint.
  
4. **Goal:**
   - The path needs to be adjusted to avoid intersecting obstacles and still reach the goal.

### Path Adjustment Strategy:

1. **Avoiding Obstacle 3 and 9:**
   - Since both obstacles are located primarily to the right of the current valid segment endpoint (2.0, 5.0), moving upward and slightly altering the direction should bypass these obstacles.

2. **New Waypoint Proposal:**
   - After (2.0, 5.0), we can move to a waypoint that avoids crossing obstacles:
     - A slightly northern path, for instance, to (2.0, 7.5) should bypass any crossings with Obstacle 3.
     - From there, transitioning right to (5.5, 7.5) should circumvent around Obstacle 9 and lead into the goal set.

3. **Final Path:**
   - The path should end with a waypoint that is within the goal set to ensure it reaches the desired endpoint.

### New Path Proposal:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),    # Start within start set
    (0.5, 3.0),     # Breakpoint 1, no obstacle
    (2.0, 5.0),     # Before the problematic area
    (2.0, 7.5),     # Avoids Obstacle 3 and 9
    (5.5, 7.5),     # Moves to right and stays clear of obstacles
    (5.5, 6.5)      # Ends within the goal set
]
```

This path is designed to be clear of obstacles, utilizing elevation and lateral movement to avoid problematic intersections while still respecting the requirements of starting, passing through breakpoints, and finishing within the correct sets.

[09/04/2024 07:06:29 PM] To adjust the path and avoid intersecting with obstacles, let's consider the spatial relationships of the obstacles and adjust the waypoints accordingly:

### Analysis:
1. **Current Path Segment:** The segment from (2.0, 5.0) to (2.0, 7.5) intersects with Obstacles 3 and 9. We need to revise this segment.
2. **Breakpoint Check:** Since we already passed through a breakpoint at (0.5, 3.0), we need to ensure the path doesn’t re-intersect obstacles.
3. **Obstacle Avoidance:** We can go around Obstacle 3 by adjusting the path to avoid its edges and continue towards the goal set without intersecting Obstacle 9.

### New Path Proposal:
1. **Start at Point in Start Set:** Start at a central point within the start set, such as (-3.5, 6.5).
2. **Move to Breakpoint:** The path should reach the nearest breakpoint: (0.5, 3.0).
3. **Avoid Obstacle 3:** 
   - Divert slightly upwards to avoid Obstacle 3 by moving to (0.5, 7.0).
   - Move right while bypassing Obstacle 3's top vertex to reach a safe point avoiding Obstacle 9: (3.5, 7.0).
4. **Bypass around Obstacle 9:** Curve around the right of Obstacle 9: (3.5, 8.0).
5. **Reach the Goal Set:** Lastly, reach a point within the goal set: (5.5, 6.5).

### New Path:
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  # start in the start set
    (0.5, 3.0),   # pass through breakpoint
    (0.5, 7.0),   # avoid the obstacle
    (3.5, 7.0),   # move to right side, avoiding obstacle intersection
    (3.5, 8.0),   # curve above Obstacle 9
    (5.5, 6.5)    # end in the goal set
]

This path ensures that the segments do not cross any obstacles and meet all specified requirements.

[09/04/2024 07:06:40 PM] ### Analysis and Path Adjustment

1. **Current Path Review**:
   - The path starts at (-3.5, 6.5) within the start set and moves to (0.5, 3.0), a breakpoint.
   - Next, it aims for (0.5, 7.0), but this segment intersects Obstacle 3.

2. **Obstacle 3 Avoidance**:
   - Obstacle 3 coordinates: [[-1.0, 6.0], [1.0, 4.0], [3.0, 6.0], [1.0, 8.0]].
   - The path must divert around or avoid passing through this obstacle. A possible detour is moving east first, then northwards around the obstacle.

3. **Path Adjustments**:
   - From (0.5, 3.0), maintain eastward travel moving to a safe spot like (3.0, 3.0) avoiding the lower part of Obstacle 3.
   - Move north slightly to avoid the top part of Obstacle 3. Aim for a waypoint like (3.5, 6.5).
   - Continue to (4.5, 6.5), a safe keeping path after passing obstacle 3.
   - Finally, approach the goal set by moving to (5.5, 6.5) within the goal set.

### New Path

new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  # Start
    (0.5, 3.0),   # Breakpoint 1
    (3.0, 3.0),   # East to avoid Obstacle 3
    (3.5, 6.5),   # North around Obstacle 3
    (4.5, 6.5),   # Continue toward the goal
    (5.5, 6.5)    # End in the goal set
]

This path ensures avoidance of Obstacle 3 and uses strategic waypoint adjustments to safely reach the goal.

## Provided Image
    The attached image shows the environment with the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is colored blue, the goal set is colored green, and the obstacles are colored red.
    The image also displays the path you provided, represented by blue waypoints that are connected in a straight line by a blue line.

## Your generated path:
    path = [(-3.5, 6.5), (0.5, 3.0), (3.0, 3.0), (3.5, 6.5), (4.5, 6.5), (5.5, 6.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[09/04/2024 07:06:48 PM] To address the issue of the path intersecting with Obstacle 9, we need to adjust the segment between (3.0, 3.0) and (3.5, 6.5). Here's the thought process:

1. **Identify Obstacle 9**: The vertices are [[4.0, 8.0], [2.0, 8.0], [2.0, 6.0], [4.0, 6.0]]. It covers the area between x=2.0 and x=4.0, and y=6.0 and y=8.0.

2. **Adjust for Avoidance**: Since the path segment (3.0, 3.0) to (3.5, 6.5) intersects with Obstacle 9, we need to reroute around it.

3. **New Waypoints**:
   - Maintain the longest valid subpath: [(-3.5, 6.5), (0.5, 3.0), (3.0, 3.0)].
   - From (3.0, 3.0), we should head slightly away from the obstacle by moving horizontally, then around the obstacle towards the goal set.
   - Introduce a detour around Obstacle 9: For instance, pass through (5.0, 5.5) which provides clearance from Obstacle 9 without intersecting it.
   - Connect to the goal from above or below, carefully avoiding the vertical and horizontal bounds of the obstacle.

4. **Avoid Obstacle Intersections**:
   - Ensure there's adequate clearance, and the path doesn't cross any obstacle.

Here's a revised path:

```python
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  # start within start set
    (0.5, 3.0),   # breakpoint 1
    (3.0, 3.0),   # valid subpath continuation
    (5.0, 5.5),   # detour around Obstacle 9
    (5.5, 6.5)    # end near the goal set
]
```

This path keeps within the constraints of not intersecting with the obstacles while beginning in the start set, passing through a breakpoint, and ending in the goal set.
