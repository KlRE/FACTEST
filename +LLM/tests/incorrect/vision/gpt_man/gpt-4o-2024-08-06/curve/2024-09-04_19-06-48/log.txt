# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[6.0, 7.0], [5.0, 7.0], [5.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[-2.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0]]

			Obstacle 9: [[4.0, 8.0], [2.0, 8.0], [2.0, 6.0], [4.0, 6.0]]
			Obstacle 10: [[6.0, 10.0], [4.0, 10.0], [4.0, 8.0], [6.0, 8.0]]

[09/04/2024 07:06:55 PM] Based on the provided information and the image, here's a plausible path:

### Path Analysis:
1. **Start Point**: Choose a point within the start set, e.g., (-3.5, 6.5).
2. **Goal Point**: Choose a point within the goal set, e.g., (5.5, 6.5).
3. **Waypoint Selection**:
   - Avoid the obstacles by analyzing their positions.
   - Select breakpoints to ensure the path meets the requirements and passes through one from each set.

### Path:
Start in the start set, avoid obstacles, and end in the goal set.

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),   # Start point in the start set
    (-1.0, 6.5),   # Move right, pass above Obstacle 3
    (0.5, 8.75),   # Pass through Breakpoint Set 1 (upper breakpoint to avoid Obstacle 7)
    (1.5, 6.5),    # Continue right avoiding Obstacle 9 and Obstacle 4
    (5.5, 6.5)     # End point in the goal set
]
```

### Explanation:
- The path starts at (-3.5, 6.5) within the start set.
- Move to (-1.0, 6.5) to pass above Obstacle 3.
- Pass through (0.5, 8.75), ensuring to use a breakpoint and avoiding Obstacle 7.
- Move to (1.5, 6.5), dodging around Obstacle 9 and 4.
- End at (5.5, 6.5) within the goal set.

The goal is to ensure the path remains clear of obstacles while passing through required breakpoints.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[09/04/2024 07:07:04 PM] To create a valid path that avoids obstacles and passes through required breakpoints, I'll analyze the initial failed attempt and propose an adjusted path.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Initial Path**: 
   - Starts at `(-3.5, 6.5)`, ends at `(5.5, 6.5)`.
   - Passes through breakpoint `(0.5, 8.75)`.
   - First segment `(-3.5, 6.5)` to `(-1.0, 6.5)` intersects with Obstacle 7, which spans from `(0.0, 6.0)` to `(-2.0, 8.0)`.

### Solution Strategy:
1. **Adjust Initial Segment**:
   - The initial segment crosses Obstacle 7, so the path must navigate below or above it.
   - Since there's a breakpoint `(0.5, 3.0)` which is below Obstacle 7, we can consider rerouting below it.

2. **Revised Path**:
   - Start at `(-3.5, 6.5)` to keep within the start set.
   - Route towards `(0.5, 3.0)` to avoid crossing Obstacle 7 and to hit a breakpoint.
   - Move upwards to connect to a safe area in the goal set like `(5.5, 6.5)`.

### Proposed Path:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),   # Start in the start set
    (-1.0, 5.5),   # Navigate below Obstacle 7
    (0.5, 3.0),    # Pass through Breakpoint Set 1
    (3.0, 5.5),    # Head upwards, avoiding central obstacles
    (5.5, 6.5)     # End in the goal set
]
```

### Explanation:
- The path begins from a valid start point and safely navigates around obstacles by choosing a route below Obstacle 7.
- It passes through a breakpoint in Set 1 for compliance.
- The path reaches a strategic point maintaining distance from the sides of obstacles and aligns with the goal set's position.
