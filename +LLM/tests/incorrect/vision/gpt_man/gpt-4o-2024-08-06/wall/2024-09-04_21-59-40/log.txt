# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data

[09/04/2024 09:59:44 PM] Given the constraints and the environment, here is a proposed path that fulfills all the requirements:

1. **Start within the start set:** Choose a point within the start quadrilateral, e.g., (0.5, 0.5).
2. **Pass through a breakpoint from Set 1:** Breakpoint (4.0, 3.0).
3. **Head towards the goal while avoiding the obstacle:** Navigate around the obstacle to maintain a safe distance.
4. **End within the goal set:** Choose a point within the goal quadrilateral, e.g., (8.5, 0.5).

### Proposed Path
```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start in the start set
    (4.0, 3.0),    # Pass through the breakpoint
    (7.0, 1.0),    # Navigate around the obstacle, keeping a safe distance
    (8.5, 0.5)     # End in the goal set
]
```

This path starts at the start set, goes through a breakpoint, avoids the obstacle by moving around it, and finally reaches the goal set while maintaining the required distances.

[09/04/2024 09:59:50 PM] To create a new path that avoids intersecting the obstacle, we'll analyze the given setup and spatial relationships.

### Analysis

1. **Start and Goal Areas**: The start set is in the bottom left, and the goal set is in the top right.
2. **Obstacle Location**: The obstacle spans diagonally from coordinates approximately (2, -4) to (7, 4). It's a large area, so we'll need careful navigation.
3. **Breakpoints**: We have two breakpoints: (4.0, -4.0) and (4.0, 3.0). The previous path used (4.0, 3.0).

### Path Challenges

- The previous path segment from (4.0, 3.0) to (7.0, 1.0) intersected with the obstacle.
- We need to find a route around the obstacle, possibly using both breakpoints, ensuring the breakpoints are used efficiently.

### Path Adjustments

1. **Initiate at Start**: Begin at (0.5, 0.5).
2. **Use the Lower Breakpoint First**: Instead of going upwards initially, go towards the lower breakpoint to avoid entering the obstacle space near its top.
3. **Move Around the Obstacle**: Incorporate an additional waypoint to navigate around the obstacle safely.

### New Path

Given these considerations, here's a suggested path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start in the start set
    (4.0, -4.0),   # Move to the lower breakpoint
    (7.5, -3.0),   # Navigate around the bottom of the obstacle
    (8.5, 0.5)     # End in the goal set
]
```

This path uses the lower breakpoint to navigate around the bottom of the obstacle, maintaining a safe distance to avoid intersection, and finally moves towards the goal.

[09/04/2024 09:59:58 PM] To adjust the path so it avoids intersecting obstacles, let's analyze the spatial relationships and adjust accordingly:

1. **Starting Point and Initial Path Analysis**:
   - The current path starts at (0.5, 0.5) which is within the start set.
   - The first segment from (0.5, 0.5) to (4.0, -4.0) crosses Obstacle 1. Adjusting this segment is necessary.

2. **Obstacle 1**:
   - Obstacle 1 has vertices at [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]. The segment (0.5, 0.5) to (4.0, -4.0) intersects this region.

3. **Planning an Avoidance Path**:
   - To avoid the obstacle, we can go around it. 
   - We can start from (0.5, 0.5), move to one of the breakpoints, and then adjust as necessary.

4. **Choosing a New Path**:
   - Start at (0.5, 0.5) from the start set.
   - Move upwards to a safe waypoint (e.g., (1.5, 2.5)) to avoid the obstacle.
   - Head towards the breakpoint (4.0, 3.0) which is safe and within the clear area.
   - Finally, move along a path to (8.5, 0.5) to reach the goal set, avoiding direct conflict with the obstacle.

Here is the revised path:

```python
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Starting within the start set
    (1.5, 2.5),    # Move up and slightly right to avoid obstacle
    (4.0, 3.0),    # Go to the breakpoint which provides a clear path
    (8.5, 0.5)     # End in the goal set
]
```

This path starts from the start set, uses a breakpoint, and ends in the goal set while avoiding the obstacles sufficiently.

    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 3 between points (4.0, 3.0) and (8.5, 0.5) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.5, 0.5), (1.5, 2.5), (4.0, 3.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/04/2024 10:00:08 PM] ### Analysis and Thought Process

1. **Understanding the Setup:**
   - The start position is in the bottom left (blue).
   - The goal position is in the top right (green).
   - One obstacle is placed diagonally across the central area (red).

2. **Initial Path Issues:**
   - The existing path from (4.0, 3.0) to (8.5, 0.5) intersects the obstacle. We need to re-route at this point.

3. **Breakpoints:**
   - We have to ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints, of which one is (4.0, 3.0), already part of the valid subpath.

4. **Path Adjustments:**
   - From (4.0, 3.0), we need to avoid the center obstacle by diverting the path around it.
   - Since the obstacle is in the center, try moving above or below it and then towards the goal.

5. **Obstacle Avoidance Strategy:**
   - Move upward from (4.0, 3.0) to avoid the obstacle's top edge.
   - Then proceed horizontally towards the goal, keeping clear of the obstacle's edges.

### New Suggested Path

The new path should take into account the need to navigate around the central obstacle:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start from the designated start area
    (1.5, 2.5),    # Intermediate point towards breakpoint
    (4.0, 3.0),    # Pass through the breakpoint
    (4.5, 6.0),    # Move upwards to go around the obstacle
    (8.5, 6.0),    # Move horizontally towards the goal
    (8.5, 0.5)     # Descend to reach inside the goal set
]
```

- **Explanation:**
  - **(4.5, 6.0):** This waypoint takes the path above the obstacle to ensure no intersection.
  - **(8.5, 6.0):** This waypoint allows us to travel horizontally towards the goal, again avoiding the obstacle.
  - **(8.5, 0.5):** Finally, descend into the goal set.
