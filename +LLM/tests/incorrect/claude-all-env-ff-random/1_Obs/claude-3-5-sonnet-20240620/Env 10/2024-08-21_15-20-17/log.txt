# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[16.9, 17.6], [10.9, 17.4], [11.6, 16.9], [13.3, 16.6]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 10.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
new_path = [
    [0.5, 0.5], # start in the start set
    [0.0, 5.25], # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate

[08/21/2024 03:20:21 PM] Here is a possible path that satisfies the given requirements:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0),  # Start in the start set
    (5.0, 10.0),
    (12.0, 17.0),
    (17.0, 19.0),  # Pass through a breakpoint
    (19.0, 19.0)   # End in the goal set
]

Explanation:

1. The path starts at a point (1.0, 2.0) within the start set.
2. The first waypoint (5.0, 10.0) is chosen to move the path diagonally upwards, avoiding the obstacle.
3. The second waypoint (12.0, 17.0) continues the diagonal motion, still avoiding the obstacle.
4. The third waypoint (17.0, 19.0) passes through one of the breakpoints in the breakpoint set.
5. The final waypoint (19.0, 19.0) is chosen to end the path within the goal set.
6. The path avoids the obstacle and does not cross any of the obstacle boundaries.

[08/21/2024 03:20:24 PM] Sure, I can help you with that. Let's analyze the problem and come up with a new path that avoids the obstacles.

Here's my thought process:

1. The initial path provided starts within the start set and ends in the goal set, which is good.
2. The first segment from (1.0, 2.0) to (5.0, 10.0) is valid and does not intersect with any obstacles.
3. However, the second segment from (5.0, 10.0) to (12.0, 17.0) intersects with Obstacle 1. This is not allowed, as the path must avoid crossing any obstacles.
4. To avoid this obstacle, we need to adjust the path. One possible way is to add an additional waypoint that allows the path to go around the obstacle.

Considering the provided breakpoint set, we can try to incorporate one of the breakpoints into the path to ensure it passes through at least one of them.

New proposed path:
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0),  # Start point within the start set
    (5.0, 10.0),  # First valid segment
    (9.0, 10.0),  # Added a waypoint at the breakpoint
    (16.0, 18.0),  # Adjusted the path to go around the obstacle
    (19.0, 19.0)  # End point within the goal set
]

This new path avoids the obstacle by adding an additional waypoint at the provided breakpoint (9.0, 10.0). The path then continues to (16.0, 18.0) to go around the obstacle and finally reaches the goal set at (19.0, 19.0).

By adjusting the path to incorporate the breakpoint and introducing a new waypoint to avoid the obstacle, we have addressed the issues with the initial path.

Please let me know if you have any other questions or if you would like me to modify the path further.

[08/21/2024 03:20:27 PM] Here's my thought process and the adjustments I made to the path:

The original path was:
path = [(1.0, 2.0), (5.0, 10.0), (9.0, 10.0), (16.0, 18.0), (19.0, 19.0)]

The main issue with this path is that the segment between (9.0, 10.0) and (16.0, 18.0) intersects with Obstacle 1. To avoid this, I will try to modify the path to go around the obstacle.

First, I will start the path at the bottom left corner of the start set, which is (0.0, 0.0). This will ensure the path starts within the start set.

Next, I will aim to go through the breakpoint at (9.0, 10.0), as required. To do this, I will add a waypoint at (5.0, 5.0) to guide the path towards the breakpoint.

After passing the breakpoint, the path needs to go towards the goal set. To avoid the obstacle, I will add a waypoint at (15.0, 15.0), which is above the obstacle. This will allow the path to clear the obstacle and reach the goal set.

Finally, I will end the path at the bottom right corner of the goal set, which is (20.0, 18.0).

The new path that avoids the obstacle is:

new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0),
    (5.0, 5.0),
    (9.0, 10.0),
    (15.0, 15.0),
    (20.0, 18.0)
]

This path starts in the start set, goes through the required breakpoint, avoids the obstacle, and ends in the goal set.
