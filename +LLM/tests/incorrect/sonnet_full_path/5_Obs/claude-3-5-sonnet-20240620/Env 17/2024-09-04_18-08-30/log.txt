# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[12.3, 11.1], [18.3, 8.4], [18.0, 11.2], [15.0, 17.6]]
			Obstacle 2: [[9.1, 12.8], [16.9, 1.5], [19.7, 4.0], [10.2, 14.6]]
			Obstacle 3: [[14.5, 17.9], [14.8, 16.7], [19.7, 15.1], [19.5, 15.8]]
			Obstacle 4: [[16.1, 15.5], [16.6, 15.7], [18.0, 17.9], [16.8, 17.4]]
			Obstacle 5: [[16.0, 12.4], [17.5, 9.6], [19.0, 14.1], [18.7, 16.6]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[09/04/2024 06:08:33 PM] Based on the provided information and requirements, here is a possible path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids the obstacles:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0), # Start within the start set quadrilateral
    (2.0, 2.0), # Move horizontally to the right
    (2.0, 18.0), # Move vertically upwards to avoid Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2
    (19.0, 18.0) # Move horizontally to the right to end within the goal set quadrilateral
]

This path satisfies the following requirements:

1. Waypoints: The path is represented as an array of 4 waypoints.
2. Non-Crossing: The path and the linearly connected segments do not cross any of the obstacles. The path maintains a safe distance from the obstacles.
3. Start and End: The path starts within the start set quadrilateral and ends within the goal set quadrilateral.

The key aspects of this path are:

- It starts at the top-left corner of the start set quadrilateral to ensure it is within the start set.
- It moves horizontally to the right to avoid Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2.
- It then moves vertically upwards to a height above the obstacles, avoiding any potential collisions.
- Finally, it moves horizontally to the right to reach the goal set quadrilateral.

This path ensures that the waypoints are connected linearly, and the path does not intersect any of the obstacles provided.
