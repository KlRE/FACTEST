# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 1.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/28/2024 06:16:04 PM] To devise a path from the start set to the goal set while avoiding obstacles and passing through a designated breakpoint, we must analyze the layout and spatial relationships of the provided sets and obstacles.

### Analysis:

**Start Position (Quadrilateral):**
- Coordinates: [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
- The area is a square positioned at the origin.

**Goal Position (Quadrilateral):**
- Coordinates: [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
- It's another square located at (4.0, 4.0) to (5.0, 5.0).

**Obstacles:**
1. Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0]]
   - This obstacle stretches horizontally from x = 2.0 to x = 4.0 at the bottom of the grid.
2. Obstacle 2: [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]
   - This obstacle blocks a large central region from x = -2.0 to x = 3.0, vertically from y = 2.0 to y = 4.0.

**Breakpoints:**
- Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 1.5), (2.0, 5.5)]
- We need to choose one of these breakpoints for the path.

### Path Planning:

**Starting Point:**
- Let's choose a point in the Start Position, such as (0.5, 0.5), which lies centrally within the start area.

**Breakpoint Passage:**
- Use the breakpoint (2.0, 1.5) as it allows moving from the start set and getting around the lower part of Obstacle 2.

**Navigating Around Obstacles:**
- From the chosen breakpoint (2.0, 1.5), we circumvent Obstacle 2 by moving upward to y = 2.0, then move horizontally to the right until x = 3.5 to clear Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2's influence.
  
**End Point:**
- Finally, move upwards and then towards the goal set where a point such as (4.5, 4.5) will safely land within the target area.

### Proposed Path:

```python
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # start within the start set
    (2.0, 1.5),   # move to a selected breakpoint
    (3.5, 2.0),   # navigate right to circumvent obstacles
    (4.5, 4.5)    # move to the goal set
]
```

### Verification:
- The path starts in the start set, passes through Breakpoint (2.0, 1.5), and ends in the goal set. 
- It avoids entry into or contact with any of the obstacles between these points.
