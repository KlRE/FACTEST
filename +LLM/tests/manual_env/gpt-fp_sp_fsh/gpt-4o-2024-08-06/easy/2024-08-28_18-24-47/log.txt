# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 1.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/28/2024 06:24:59 PM] To solve the motion planning task based on the provided data, we need to craft a path beginning from the start set, passing through specified breakpoints, avoiding obstacles, and ending in the goal set. Letâ€™s break down the process into a final path selection, without violating any of the constraints:

### Analysis and Path Planning:

1. **Start and Goal Definitions**:
   - **Start Quadrilateral**: Vertices are \[(1.0, 1.0), (0.0, 1.0), (0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 0.0)\]. So, a possible start point can be \((0.5, 0.5)\) since it is centrally located.
   - **Goal Quadrilateral**: Vertices are \[(5.0, 5.0), (4.0, 5.0), (4.0, 4.0), (5.0, 4.0)\]. A potential endpoint can be \((4.5, 4.5)\).

2. **Obstacle Locations**:
   - **Obstacle 1**: Vertices \[(4.0, 1.0), (2.0, 1.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0)\]. This means the vertical space from \(y = 0.0\) to \(y = 1.0\) between \(x = 2.0\) to \(x = 4.0\) is occupied.
   - **Obstacle 2**: Vertices \[(3.0, 4.0), (-2.0, 4.0), (-2.0, 2.0), (3.0, 2.0)\]. This indicates a larger blocked area in the middle of our map.

3. **Breakpoint Utilization**:
   - **Breakpoint Set 1**: Containing \((2.0, -2.5)\), \((2.0, 1.5)\), \((2.0, 5.5)\). Each point here provides potential paths through separate vertical levels.

4. **Path Design**:
   - Start in the middle of the start area; navigate upwards to avoid Obstacle 1 by staying above \(y = 1.0\).
   - Utilize the breakpoint \((2.0, 1.5)\) to significantly ensure avoiding the first obstacle vertically.
   - Direct the path towards a point that skirts between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2 vertically above their shared y-axis span. A safer waypoint can be approximately \((2.5, 1.5)\).
   - Then, navigate to avoid turning right across the top of Obstacle 1 toward \((3.5, 1.5)\), staying clear of their specified range but retaining linear visibility past them.
   - Lastly, descend toward the goal area at \((4.5, 4.5)\).

### Proposed Path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start within start set
    (2.0, 1.5),  # Breakpoint and clearing Obstacle 1
    (2.5, 1.5),  # Move between boundaries of Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2
    (3.5, 1.5),  # Continue drawing near the open path longitudinally
    (4.5, 4.5)   # Reach towards inside of goal set
]
```

This path meets all requirements: starting within the start area, passing through a designated breakpoint, avoiding defined obstacle areas effectively, and ending within the goal area.
