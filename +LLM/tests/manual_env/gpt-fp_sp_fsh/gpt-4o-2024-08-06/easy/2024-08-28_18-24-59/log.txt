# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 1.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/28/2024 06:25:06 PM] To design a path that adheres to the specified requirements while ensuring none of the obstacles are touched or crossed, consider the following:

### Observations:
- **Start Set** is defined by the quadrilateral with vertices at [(1.0, 1.0), (0.0, 1.0), (0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 0.0)]. We can select any point within this area as the starting point.
- **Goal Set** is defined by the quadrilateral with vertices at [(5.0, 5.0), (4.0, 5.0), (4.0, 4.0), (5.0, 4.0)]. We can select any point within this area as the endpoint.
- **Obstacles**:
  - Obstacle 1: [(4.0, 1.0), (2.0, 1.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0)]
  - Obstacle 2: [(3.0, 4.0), (-2.0, 4.0), (-2.0, 2.0), (3.0, 2.0)]
- **Breakpoints**: We need to select at least one waypoint from each breakpoint set provided. Here we have a set with:
  - Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 1.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

### Path Strategy:
1. **Start Point**: Choose a convenient point inside the start set. For simplicity, let's start at (0.5, 0.5).
2. **First Breakpoint**: We choose (2.0, 1.5) from the first breakpoint set as a waypoint, which ensures path alignment since it doesnâ€™t require us to cross any obstacles or deviate much.
3. **Transit Point**: Move to an intermediate waypoint that avoids obstacles and gets around them efficiently. Here, we choose (3.5, 1.5) which stays clear of obstacle boundaries.
4. **Goal Point**: Move towards a suitable endpoint inside the goal set. (4.5, 4.5) would work, as it aligns with the path from our transit point.

### Final Path:
This leads us to the following path configuration:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start in the start set
    (2.0, 1.5),  # Waypoint from Breakpoint Set 1
    (3.5, 1.5),  # Transit point avoiding obstacles
    (4.5, 4.5)   # End point in the goal set
]
```

### Path Explanation:
- The path begins at a reasonable start point within the defined start set.
- The path includes a point from the specified breakpoint set, satisfying the requirement.
- A strategic transit point is chosen to ensure the path avoids obstacles and follows a logical trajectory.
- The path ends smoothly within the goal set boundaries.
- The path segments do not intersect any of the defined obstacles. Each connection between waypoints is checked for proximity to obstacle edges and avoids crossing obstacle areas.
