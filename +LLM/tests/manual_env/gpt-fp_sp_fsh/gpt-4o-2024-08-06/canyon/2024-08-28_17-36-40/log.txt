# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -1.58), (2.0, 1.72)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/28/2024 05:36:46 PM] To design a path from the given start set to the goal set while avoiding the obstacles, we must select waypoints that form a continuous path without intersecting any of the obstacles. Here's a strategy to determine such a path:

### Analysis of the Environment
1. **Start and Goal Position:**
   - The start position is a quadrilateral zone, and we can choose any point inside it as the initial waypoint.
   - The goal position is similarly defined, and we need to end the path inside it.

2. **Obstacles:**
   - We have two obstacle quadrilaterals. Our task is to ensure that our path does not intersect these obstacle regions.
   
3. **Breakpoints:**
   - We are given two breakpoints. The path must pass through one of them.

### Path Strategy
- **Initial Approach:**
  - Start within the start set at a convenient point that allows easy avoidance of obstacles.
  - Move towards a selected breakpoint to satisfy the breakpoint requirement.
  - Then, navigate towards the goal position, ensuring the path skirts around obstacles.

### New Path Design
Here is a potential path considering the defined criteria:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (-0.25, 0.5),  # Starting point within the start quadrilateral.
    (2.0, 1.72),   # Choose the second breakpoint, which safely leads the path through the available space.
    (3.1, 2.5),    # Carefully navigate towards the goal set, avoiding obstacles and staying clear.
    (3.9, 3.0)     # End within the goal set
]
```

### Explanation of Waypoints:
1. **(-0.25, 0.5):** 
   - This point is within the given start quadrilateral and serves as our starting point.

2. **(2.0, 1.72):** 
   - This is a breakpoint from the first set. It helps in providing a guideline to navigate the path such that the path remains valid.

3. **(3.1, 2.5):**
   - This waypoint is strategically placed to avoid crossing the obstacles while guiding the path smoothly towards the goal area. It serves as an intermediary point ensuring the path stays clear of obstacles.

4. **(3.9, 3.0):**
   - This point lies within the provided goal area and serves as the endpoint of our path.

This path configuration is structured to meet all requirements: starting within the start set, using a breakpoint, avoiding obstacles, and ending within the goal set.
