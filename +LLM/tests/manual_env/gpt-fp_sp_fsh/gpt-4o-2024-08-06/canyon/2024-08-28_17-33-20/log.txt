# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -1.58), (2.0, 1.72)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/28/2024 05:33:27 PM] To design a non-crossing path from the start set to the goal set avoiding obstacles and passing through a breakpoint, we analyze the provided spatial data:

### Provided Data Summary
- **Start Quadrilateral**: [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
- **Goal Quadrilateral**: [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]
- **Obstacles**: 
  - Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
  - Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]
- **Breakpoints**: Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -1.58), (2.0, 1.72)]

### Path Plan
1. **Start Point Selection**: Choose a point within the start quadrilateral. For simplicity, (-0.1, 0.5) is chosen as it is well within the boundary and clear from obstacles.
2. **Breakpoint Passing**: 
   - Select (2.0, 1.72) from the available breakpoints as it lies more naturally in the direct path between the start and goal set.
3. **Goal Point Selection**: Choose a point within the goal quadrilateral. (3.5, 2.5) fits within the goal boundaries and offers straightforward final movement.
4. **Path Waypoints**:
   - **Waypoint 1**: (-0.1, 0.5) - Start
   - **Waypoint 2**: (2.0, 1.72) - Pass through selected breakpoint
   - **Waypoint 3**: (3.0, 2.2) - Intermediate waypoint to avoid the proximity to obstacles further along the path
   - **Waypoint 4**: (3.5, 2.5) - Endpoint within the goal quadrilateral

### Obstacle Avoidance Strategy
- **Obstacle 1**: With its vertices spanning an area well above our route and positioned further horizontally, our waypoints intentionally remain to the east.
- **Obstacle 2**: This obstacle is primarily to the southwest. The path from (-0.1, 0.5) to (2.0, 1.72) travels above it.
- Both obstacle geometries guide our waypoints towards the safe edges that ensure avoidance.

Therefore, the constructed path considering these constraints and positions is as follows:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (-0.1, 0.5),   # start within the start set
    (2.0, 1.72),   # pass through a selected breakpoint
    (3.0, 2.2),    # intermediate waypoint for safe traversal
    (3.5, 2.5)     # end within the goal set
]
```

By following this route, we fulfill all criteria: start and end within designated sets, pass through a breakpoint, and avoid obstacles.
