# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.0, 1.0], [8.0, 1.0], [8.0, -0.0], [9.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.0, -4.0), (4.0, 3.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/28/2024 08:37:48 PM] To create a path that meets the outlined requirements, we need to navigate from the start set to the goal set while avoiding the obstacle and passing through the specified breakpoints. Here is a proposed path:

### Path Analysis
1. **Start Set**: We start somewhere within the defined quadrilateral. A starting position of (0.5, 0.5) is chosen, which is centrally located within the potential start area.

2. **Breakpoint Navigation**: We choose the breakpoint (4.0, -4.0) from the provided set. The path must be planned carefully to reach this point while avoiding the obstacle.

3. **Obstacle Avoidance**: The obstacle is defined with corners at [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]. The critical part is to thoughtfully plan waypoints that provide clearance from the obstacle, especially when navigating close to its edges.

4. **Goal Set**: Finally, the path should end within the goal set, and we choose a point such as (8.5, 0.5) for this purpose, which is centrally located within the goal area.

### Proposed Path
Considering all the above factors, the sequence of waypoints might look like this:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),     # Start in the start set
    (1.0, 0.5),     # Move right towards avoiding the obstacle
    (2.0, -4.5),    # Navigate towards the breakpoint, keeping below the obstacle
    (4.0, -4.0),    # Pass through the chosen breakpoint
    (6.0, -4.0),    # Navigate parallel to the bottom edge of the obstacle
    (8.0, 0.5),     # Move up towards the goal set
    (8.5, 0.5)      # End within the goal area
]
```

### Explanation
- The path initially moves rightward and slightly downward to navigate under the obstacle before reaching the chosen breakpoint.
- Careful attention is placed on maintaining safe clearance from the obstacle, particularly around the breakpoint, which is situated just outside the bottom left corner of the obstacle.
- Following the breakpoint, a direct path to the goal area is selected, maintaining awareness of the obstacle's boundaries throughout the journey. This path should ensure compliance with the motion planning task requirements by skirting around the obstacle and intersecting no boundaries, all while respecting start, goal, and breakpoint constraints.
