# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[6.0, 7.0], [5.0, 7.0], [5.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[-2.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0], [-2.0, -1.0], [0.0, -1.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[-1.0, 6.0], [1.0, 4.0], [3.0, 6.0], [1.0, 8.0]]
			Obstacle 4: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -1.0], [4.0, -1.0]]
			Obstacle 5: [[6.0, 3.0], [4.0, 3.0], [4.0, 1.0], [6.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 6: [[-2.0, 10.0], [-4.0, 10.0], [-4.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 8.0]]
			Obstacle 7: [[0.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 6.0], [0.0, 6.0]]
			Obstacle 8: [[-1.0, 0.0], [1.0, -2.0], [3.0, 0.0], [1.0, 2.0]]
			Obstacle 9: [[4.0, 8.0], [2.0, 8.0], [2.0, 6.0], [4.0, 6.0]]
			Obstacle 10: [[6.0, 10.0], [4.0, 10.0], [4.0, 8.0], [6.0, 8.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(0.5, -2.75), (0.5, 3.0), (0.5, 8.75)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/28/2024 05:43:14 PM] To plan a path from the start position to the goal position while avoiding obstacles and passing through one of the breakpoints, we need to carefully consider the provided data. Our goal is to create a sequence of waypoints that satisfies all the given criteria. Let's break down these requirements and devise the path accordingly.

### Analysis:
1. **Start Set**: The start quadrilateral is defined within the coordinates \([[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]\), allowing us to start at a point such as \((-3.5, 6.5)\).

2. **Goal Set**: The goal quadrilateral is situated at \([6.0, 7.0], [5.0, 7.0], [5.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0]]\). An endpoint like \((5.5, 6.5)\) is appropriate.

3. **Obstacles**: The obstacles must be carefully avoided. We will choose waypoints that navigate around these quadrilaterals without intersecting them.

4. **Breakpoints**: We are required to pass through at least one of the given breakpoints: \((0.5, -2.75)\), \((0.5, 3.0)\), or \((0.5, 8.75)\). We will select \((0.5, 3.0)\) for this purpose.

### Path Planning:
Given the spatial arrangement, we'll plan a path that strategically maneuvers around the obstacles while meeting all the requirements:

1. Start at a point in the start set, e.g., \((-3.5, 6.5)\).
2. Move towards and pass through the breakpoint \((0.5, 3.0)\).
3. Navigate through open paths avoiding obstacles, and finally,
4. End at any point within the goal set, e.g., \((5.5, 6.5)\).

### Proposed Path:
Hereâ€™s a step-by-step list of the waypoints:

1. **(Start):** \((-3.5, 6.5)\) - a point within the start set.
2. \((-3.5, 5.0)\) - move downwards to navigate past the left side of obstacle 3.
3. \((-0.5, 5.0)\) - move horizontally, keeping clear of obstacles.
4. \((-0.5, 3.5)\) - further down, now preparing to pass below obstacles.
5. **(Breakpoint):** \((0.5, 3.0)\) - pass through this chosen breakpoint.
6. \((3.5, 3.0)\) - move horizontally to position between obstacles 1 and 5.
7. **(End):** \((5.5, 6.5)\) - finally move up and right into the goal set.

### Path as Array of Waypoints:
The calculated path in the required format is:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),
    (-3.5, 5.0),
    (-0.5, 5.0),
    (-0.5, 3.5),
    (0.5, 3.0),
    (3.5, 3.0),
    (5.5, 6.5)
]
```

This path fulfills all the task requirements: starts in the start set, avoids obstacles, passes through a breakpoint, and ends in the goal set.
