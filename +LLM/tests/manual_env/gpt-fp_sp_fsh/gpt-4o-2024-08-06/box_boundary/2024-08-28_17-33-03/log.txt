# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[0.0, 10.0], [-0.1, 10.0], [-0.1, -0.0], [0.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[10.1, 10.0], [10.0, 10.0], [10.0, -0.0], [10.1, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[10.0, 0.0], [-0.0, 0.0], [-0.0, -0.1], [10.0, -0.1]]
			Obstacle 4: [[10.0, 10.1], [-0.0, 10.1], [-0.0, 10.0], [10.0, 10.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 5.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/28/2024 05:33:10 PM] To define a path that adheres to the given constraints, let's begin by analyzing the provided sets and obstacles. Our goal is to start within the start quadrilateral, pass through the specified breakpoints, avoid obstacles, and end within the goal quadrilateral.

### Analysis

1. **Start Set**: The start quadrilateral is defined by points [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]. We can choose any convenient point within this area. Let's choose approximately the center at (1.75, 1.75) for simplicity.

2. **Goal Set**: The goal quadrilateral is defined by points [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]. Likewise, choose the center, say (9.0, 9.0), to ease calculations.

3. **Breakpoints**: We have a breakpoint at (5.12, 5.0) that our path must pass through.

4. **Obstacles**: Analyzing the obstacles:
   - Obstacles 1, 2, 3, and 4 form a bounding box slightly beyond the main arena edges, effectively constraining us within the range [0, 10] for both axes.

### Path Planning

Given the constraints and positions, a possible path could be planned as follows:

1. Start at a point within the start quadrilateral, say (1.75, 1.75).
2. Move towards the breakpoint at (5.12, 5.0), ensuring we do not cross any obstacles.
3. Finally, move to our goal point at (9.0, 9.0).

### Proposed Path

This path ensures a clear route while respecting all constraints:

- Start at (1.75, 1.75) — within the start set.
- Navigate to the breakpoint at (5.12, 5.0).
- Arrive at the goal position (9.0, 9.0) — within the goal set.

Thus, the final path can be described by the following waypoints:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start within the start set
    (5.12, 5.0),   # Move through the breakpoint
    (9.0, 9.0)     # End within the goal set
]
```

This path is straight and simple, ensuring no intersection with any obstacles by smoothly connecting the start, breakpoint, and goal.
