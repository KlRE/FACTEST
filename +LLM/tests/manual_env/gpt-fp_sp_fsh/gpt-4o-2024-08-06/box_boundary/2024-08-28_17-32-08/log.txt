# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[0.0, 10.0], [-0.1, 10.0], [-0.1, -0.0], [0.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[10.1, 10.0], [10.0, 10.0], [10.0, -0.0], [10.1, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[10.0, 0.0], [-0.0, 0.0], [-0.0, -0.1], [10.0, -0.1]]
			Obstacle 4: [[10.0, 10.1], [-0.0, 10.1], [-0.0, 10.0], [10.0, 10.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 5.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/28/2024 05:32:15 PM] To create a path that starts in the start set, goes through the required breakpoints, avoids obstacles, and ends in the goal set, we can proceed with the following analysis:

### Analysis:

#### Start Position:
The start position is a quadrilateral defined by the coordinates: [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]. We can choose any point within this quadrilateral to start the path. For simplicity, let's select the center point (1.75, 1.75).

#### Goal Position:
The goal position is another quadrilateral defined by the coordinates: [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]. Similarly, any point inside here can be chosen. For this case, let's select the center point (9.0, 9.0).

#### Obstacles:
There are four obstacles represented as quadrilaterals. The obstacles are structured in such a way that they create perimeter boundaries around the area of interest.

- Obstacle 1: Located at the left boundary of the coordinate system.
- Obstacle 2: Located at the right boundary of the coordinate system.
- Obstacle 3: Located at the bottom boundary.
- Obstacle 4: Located at the top boundary.

These obstacles act as fences around the area, with a gap present in the central area for navigation.

#### Breakpoints:
There is one breakpoint provided: (5.12, 5.0). We must ensure that the path passes through this point.

### Path Construction:

We'll build the path by connecting waypoints linearly while ensuring that no obstacles are crossed:

1. **Start at:** (1.75, 1.75) — within the start set.
2. **Navigate to the Breakpoint:** (5.12, 5.0) — the designated breakpoint.
3. **Move to Goal:** (9.0, 9.0) — within the goal set.

Given that the obstacles act as boundary limits and the chosen waypoints lie well within the inner area, there is no risk of crossing any obstacles.

### Resulting Path:

The path, represented as a list of waypoints, will be:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Starting point within the start set
    (5.12, 5.0),   # Breakpoint we are required to pass through
    (9.0, 9.0)     # End point within the goal set
]
```

This path begins within the start quadrilateral, follows a straightforward path through the provided breakpoint without intersecting any obstacles, and concludes within the goal quadrilateral.
