# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[0.0, 10.0], [-0.1, 10.0], [-0.1, -0.0], [0.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[10.1, 10.0], [10.0, 10.0], [10.0, -0.0], [10.1, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[10.0, 0.0], [-0.0, 0.0], [-0.0, -0.1], [10.0, -0.1]]
			Obstacle 4: [[10.0, 10.1], [-0.0, 10.1], [-0.0, 10.0], [10.0, 10.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 5.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/28/2024 05:33:20 PM] To construct a path that meets the specified criteria, we need to begin within the start quadrilateral, travel through the set of breakpoints, and conclude within the goal quadrilateral, while avoiding any obstacles.

### Analysis of the Environment:

1. **Start Position:** The quadrilateral is defined by the vertices \((2.0, 2.0), (1.5, 2.0), (1.5, 1.5), (2.0, 1.5)\). Any point within this quadrilateral can be selected as the starting waypoint.

2. **Goal Position:** The quadrilateral for the goal position is \((9.5, 9.5), (8.5, 9.5), (8.5, 8.5), (9.5, 8.5)\). Any point inside this area can serve as the endpoint.

3. **Obstacles:** 
   - Obstacle 1: Vertical line at \(x = -0.1\), essentially outside the horizontal bounds.
   - Obstacle 2: Vertical line at \(x = 10.0\) to \(10.1\), outside the horizontal bounds.
   - Obstacle 3: Horizontal line at \(y = -0.1\), outside the vertical bounds.
   - Obstacle 4: Horizontal line at \(y = 10.0\), essentially closing the top but slightly higher. 

   Given their coordinates, these obstacles bound the defined space broadly, and the path should remain within the main block \(x: 0 \text{ to } 10, y: 0 \text{ to } 10\).

4. **Breakpoints:** The path must pass through \((5.12, 5.0)\).

### Path Construction:

Based on the above details, the path can be planned as follows:

- **Start** at a strategic point within the start quadrilateral, e.g., \((1.75, 1.75)\), a midpoint within the provided square.
  
- Move to a safe and clear route avoiding the boundaries where obstacles are inactive; ensure the waypoint connects towards the breakpoint effectively.

- **Through the Breakpoint:** Ensure passing through \((5.12, 5.0)\). 

- Finally, head towards the goal region gradually steering clear of any boundary obstructions.

#### Path Construction:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75), # Start: within the start quadrilateral
    (5.12, 5.0),  # Breakpoint: mandatory visit through this point
    (9.0, 9.0),   # End: within the goal quadrilateral, safely reach the goal
]
```

This proposed path respects the requirements: starting and ending within their designated quadrilaterals, passing via a breakpoint, and circumventing any predefined obstacles.
