# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[0.0, 10.0], [-0.1, 10.0], [-0.1, -0.0], [0.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[10.1, 10.0], [10.0, 10.0], [10.0, -0.0], [10.1, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[10.0, 0.0], [-0.0, 0.0], [-0.0, -0.1], [10.0, -0.1]]
			Obstacle 4: [[10.0, 10.1], [-0.0, 10.1], [-0.0, 10.0], [10.0, 10.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 5.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/28/2024 05:32:00 PM] To construct a path from the start position to the goal position while avoiding obstacles and ensuring the path passes through the required breakpoints, we'll first identify positions and plan around the given constraints.

### Provided Data Analysis

1. **Start Position (Quadrilateral):** Defined by vertices \((2.0, 2.0), (1.5, 2.0), (1.5, 1.5), (2.0, 1.5)\). This is a small square area where any point can be selected. We'll choose \((1.75, 1.75)\) as a starting waypoint for simplicity.

2. **Goal Position (Quadrilateral):** Defined by vertices \((9.5, 9.5), (8.5, 9.5), (8.5, 8.5), (9.5, 8.5)\). We can select a point comfortably within the goal, such as \((9.0, 9.0)\).

3. **Obstacles (Quadrilaterals):** 
   - Obstacle 1: Vertical line at \(x = 0.0\).
   - Obstacle 2: Vertical line at \(x = 10.0\).
   - Obstacle 3: Horizontal line at \(y = 0.0\).
   - Obstacle 4: Horizontal line at \(y = 10.0\).

4. **Breakpoint Set:** \((5.12, 5.0)\).

### Path Planning

Given the quadrilateral shape of obstacles, the main concerns are edges of the plane, and with the identified break point, the strategy would involve moving towards the break point directly from the start, then moving towards the goal point.

### Proposed Path

Here is a pathway plan that moves from start to the breakpoint, and then to goal while ensuring all segments are obstacle-free:

1. **Start:** Begin at \((1.75, 1.75)\) inside the start position.
2. **Waypoint to Breakpoint:** Move directly to the breakpoint at \((5.12, 5.0)\).
3. **Towards Goal:** Move from the breakpoint to a carefully chosen point, \((8.5, 5.5)\), maintaining clearance from potential obstacles along vertical boundaries.
4. **End at Goal:** Finally, go to \((9.0, 9.0)\) within the goal position.

The proposed waypoints are designed to avoid crossing obstacle boundaries by maintaining adequate clearance. The use of the break point ensures compliance with path requirements.

### New Path
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),   # Starting point inside the start position
    (5.12, 5.0),    # Passing through the required breakpoint
    (8.5, 5.5),     # Moving towards the goal position
    (9.0, 9.0)      # Final point within the goal position
]
``` 

This path respects all constraints, keeps a safe distance from all identified obstacles, includes necessary breakpoints, and appropriately transitions between the start and goal areas.
