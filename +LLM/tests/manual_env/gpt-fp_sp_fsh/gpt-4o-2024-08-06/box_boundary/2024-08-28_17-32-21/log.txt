# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[0.0, 10.0], [-0.1, 10.0], [-0.1, -0.0], [0.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[10.1, 10.0], [10.0, 10.0], [10.0, -0.0], [10.1, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[10.0, 0.0], [-0.0, 0.0], [-0.0, -0.1], [10.0, -0.1]]
			Obstacle 4: [[10.0, 10.1], [-0.0, 10.1], [-0.0, 10.0], [10.0, 10.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 5.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/28/2024 05:32:37 PM] To devise a path that adheres to the requirements outlined in the task, we'll execute a step-by-step plan ensuring that the path starts within the Start Position quadrilateral, passes through the specified Breakpoint and finishes within the Goal Position quadrilateral while avoiding all listed obstacles.

### Analysis
1. **Start and Goal Positions**: 
   - Start Position: A point within the quadrilateral defined by [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]. I will start at (1.75, 1.75), which is the centroid of the Start Position quadrilateral.
   - Goal Position: A point within the quadrilateral defined by [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]. I'll end at (9.0, 9.0), which is the centroid of the Goal Position quadrilateral.

2. **Breakpoints and Obstacles**: 
   - The path must pass through the Breakpoint Set 1: (5.12, 5.0).
   - We need to avoid crossing the perimeter of any of the obstacles defined.

### Path Design
Taking these constraints into account, below is a proposed path:

```plaintext
1. Start at (1.75, 1.75) within the Start Position.
2. Move diagonally toward the breakpoint, let's choose a waypoint that assures avoidance of obstacles, such as (3.0, 3.0).
3. Pass through Breakpoint Set 1 at (5.12, 5.0).
4. From the breakpoint, move diagonally while ensuring to stay clear of obstacles, such as (7.0, 7.0).
5. Finally, end at (9.0, 9.0) within the Goal Position.
```

### Proposed Path
Based on the analysis and considerations, the waypoints forming the path are as follows:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start point within Start Position
    (3.0, 3.0),    # Intermediate point avoiding obstacles
    (5.12, 5.0),   # Pass through the breakpoint
    (7.0, 7.0),    # Another intermediate waypoint
    (9.0, 9.0)     # Endpoint within Goal Position
]
```

This path is designed to avoid crossing any obstacles while satisfying the path requirements provided in the task instructions.
