# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[0.0, 10.0], [-0.1, 10.0], [-0.1, -0.0], [0.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[10.1, 10.0], [10.0, 10.0], [10.0, -0.0], [10.1, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[10.0, 0.0], [-0.0, 0.0], [-0.0, -0.1], [10.0, -0.1]]
			Obstacle 4: [[10.0, 10.1], [-0.0, 10.1], [-0.0, 10.0], [10.0, 10.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 5.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/28/2024 05:32:55 PM] To determine a feasible path for motion planning based on the provided data, we need to start at a point within the given start set, pass through the provided breakpoints, avoid obstacles, and end at a point within the goal set.

### Provided Data Analysis

1. **Start Position**: The start position quadrilateral is defined by the vertices:
   - [(2.0, 2.0), (1.5, 2.0), (1.5, 1.5), (2.0, 1.5)]
   - We can choose any point within this area, such as (1.75, 1.75).

2. **Goal Position**: The goal position quadrilateral is given by:
   - [(9.5, 9.5), (8.5, 9.5), (8.5, 8.5), (9.5, 8.5)]
   - We can choose any point within this area, such as (9.0, 9.0).

3. **Obstacles**: Four obstacles are essentially axis-aligned lines defining the edges of the operational area at x = 0, x = 10, y = 0, and y = 10. Thus, the path should remain within the bounds of (0.0, 0.0) to (10.0, 10.0).

4. **Breakpoints**: There is one breakpoint that the path must pass through:
   - Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 5.0)]

### Path Planning
To create a path, we will:
- Begin within the start set.
- Pass through the required breakpoint.
- Avoid crossing any obstacle by staying within the defined boundaries.
- End in the goal set.

### Path Proposal
Based on the analysis, a feasible path considering the requirements would be:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),    # Start within the start set
    (5.12, 5.0),     # Pass through the required breakpoint
    (9.0, 9.0)       # End within the goal set
]
```

This path:
- Starts at a midpoint within the start quadrilateral.
- Moves directly to the required breakpoint, (5.12, 5.0).
- No obstacles are crossed since the obstacles form the perimeter.
- Ends at a midpoint within the goal quadrilateral.

Although the directness of this path assumes a simple straight-line trajectory in an open area avoiding described boundaries, it achieves all required tasks by starting, passing through the breakpoint, and completing in the goal area without any obstacle violations, given the constraints and boundaries.
