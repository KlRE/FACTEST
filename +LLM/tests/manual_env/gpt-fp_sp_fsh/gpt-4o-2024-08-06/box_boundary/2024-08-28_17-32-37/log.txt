# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[0.0, 10.0], [-0.1, 10.0], [-0.1, -0.0], [0.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[10.1, 10.0], [10.0, 10.0], [10.0, -0.0], [10.1, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[10.0, 0.0], [-0.0, 0.0], [-0.0, -0.1], [10.0, -0.1]]
			Obstacle 4: [[10.0, 10.1], [-0.0, 10.1], [-0.0, 10.0], [10.0, 10.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 5.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/28/2024 05:32:43 PM] To develop a path from the start set to the goal set while avoiding obstacles and ensuring the path passes through required breakpoints, we can break down the process step by step. Here's the solution based on the provided data:

### Analysis:
1. **Start Position:** Within the quadrilateral defined by [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]], you can choose any point within this quadrilateral. For simplicity, we'll start at (1.75, 1.75).

2. **Goal Position:** The goal is within the quadrilateral [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]. Let's end at (9.0, 9.0).

3. **Breakpoints:** We have a waypoint from the breakpoints set that needs to be included in the path. The given breakpoint is (5.12, 5.0).

4. **Obstacles Consideration:** The obstacles defined in the space act as boundary constraints. We note that the outer region is enclosed by obstacles as near-wall boundaries.

### Path Planning:
Given the constraints, the path can be planned as:

1. Start near the middle of the starting area: **(1.75, 1.75)**
2. Head towards the breakpoint while staying clear of boundaries and constraints: **(5.12, 5.0)**
3. Once the breakpoint is reached, continue to the goal while avoiding obstacles: **(9.0, 9.0)**

### New Path:
Here's the path expressed as an ordered array of waypoints:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start in the start set
    (5.12, 5.0),   # Passing through the breakpoint
    (9.0, 9.0)     # End in the goal set
]
```

This path efficiently starts within the specified start region, passes through the mandatory breakpoint, avoids all obstacles as described, and ends within the designated goal area. The path incorporates linearly connected waypoints that maintain a safe distance from the obstacles outlined.
