# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[0.0, 10.0], [-0.1, 10.0], [-0.1, -0.0], [0.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[10.1, 10.0], [10.0, 10.0], [10.0, -0.0], [10.1, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[10.0, 0.0], [-0.0, 0.0], [-0.0, -0.1], [10.0, -0.1]]
			Obstacle 4: [[10.0, 10.1], [-0.0, 10.1], [-0.0, 10.0], [10.0, 10.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/29/2024 12:07:34 PM] To develop a path that meets the outlined requirements, we need to plot a course starting in the defined starting quadrilateral and ending in the goal quadrilateral, all while avoiding the specified obstacles. Here’s a logical breakdown of how this path could be structured:

### Starting Quadrilateral
- **Coordinates:** [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
- **Allowed starting point:** Choose a point within this quadrilateral, such as (1.75, 1.75).

### Goal Quadrilateral
- **Coordinates:** [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
- **Allowed goal point:** Choose a point within this quadrilateral, such as (9.0, 9.0).

### Obstacles and Path Planning
- Obstacles create barriers around the perimeter with very close tight boundaries, meaning the path needs to be kept within the inner 10x10 unit square.
- Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 4 form nearly the entire bottom area and require us to start by moving vertically towards the top.
- Since Obstacle 1 is very close to the left and top boundaries and Obstacle 2 is very close to the right and top boundaries, the path must focus more centrally along its axis of motion.

### Outline for the Path
1. **Start at (1.75, 1.75)**: This is a safe midpoint starting position within the starting quadrilateral.
2. **Move to (5.0, 5.0)**: This midpoint maneuver roughly bisects the path and keeps you clear from boundaries while moving upward.
3. **End at (9.0, 9.0)**: Conclude within the goal quadrilateral comfortably avoiding the corners.

### Path Points
Following this analysis, here’s the proposed path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Begin in the start quadrilateral
    (5.0, 5.0),    # Navigate centrally across the main area
    (9.0, 9.0)     # Complete the path in the goal area
]
```

This path ensures a clear and definitive traversal from the start to the goal set, maintaining sufficient clearance from any of the obstacles.
