# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[0.0, 10.0], [-0.1, 10.0], [-0.1, -0.0], [0.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[10.1, 10.0], [10.0, 10.0], [10.0, -0.0], [10.1, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[10.0, 0.0], [-0.0, 0.0], [-0.0, -0.1], [10.0, -0.1]]
			Obstacle 4: [[10.0, 10.1], [-0.0, 10.1], [-0.0, 10.0], [10.0, 10.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/29/2024 12:07:43 PM] To create a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids the given obstacles, we must consider a route that stays within bounds, avoiding any crossing of the perimeter defined by the obstacles.

### Analysis:
- **Start Quadrilateral:** [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
- **Goal Quadrilateral:** [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
- **Obstacles Boundaries:** 
  1. Leftmost vertical barrier along x=0.0
  2. Rightmost vertical barrier along x=10.0
  3. Bottommost horizontal barrier along y=0.0
  4. Topmost horizontal barrier along y=10.0

Given these subsequently "boxed" obstacles on all sides, a potential path could be conceived by navigating in the open space between these constraints:

### Path Considerations:
1. Start in a point within the starting quadrilateral.
2. Move towards the goal quadrilateral without hitting the boundaries defined by obstacles.
3. Stay clear from the barriers to ensure non-crossing.

### Suggested Path:
Given the geometry of the layout, one possible path could take advantage of the central area between the barriers:

1. **Start Point:** Let us begin at an inner point in the start quadrilateral, choosing arbitrarily (1.75, 1.75) for a safe start close to the grid center.
2. **First Move:** Navigate diagonally up and to the right, aiming to stay centered. Waypoint: (4.0, 4.0)
3. **Second Move:** Continue moving diagonally upwards and rightwards, making sure to stay well within the boundary buffer. Waypoint: (7.0, 7.0)
4. **Final Approach:** Approach the goal quadrilateral from the diagonal entrance by moving a bit more. Waypoint: (8.5, 8.5)

### Conclusion:
This explicit path avoids touching any obstacles by maintaining a buffer zone around the defined barriers.

Here is the final path using the waypoint format:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start within the start set
    (4.0, 4.0),    # Approach upward diagonally keeping within safe central corridor
    (7.0, 7.0),    # Continue pattern in similar manner
    (8.5, 8.5)     # Final descent into goal set ensuring an arrival point well within boundaries
]
```

This chosen path adheres to the motion planning requirements ensuring a clear, non-collision course from the start to the goal.
