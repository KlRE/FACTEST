# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[0.0, 10.0], [-0.1, 10.0], [-0.1, -0.0], [0.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[10.1, 10.0], [10.0, 10.0], [10.0, -0.0], [10.1, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[10.0, 0.0], [-0.0, 0.0], [-0.0, -0.1], [10.0, -0.1]]
			Obstacle 4: [[10.0, 10.1], [-0.0, 10.1], [-0.0, 10.0], [10.0, 10.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/29/2024 12:08:31 PM] To construct a path from the given start position to the goal position without crossing any obstacles, we need to consider the placement of the obstacles. The obstacle arrangement effectively blocks certain paths, but we can find a feasible path around them. Here's an analysis and the proposed path:

### Environment Analysis
1. **Start Set:**
   - The start set is a quadrilateral with vertices at (2.0, 2.0), (1.5, 2.0), (1.5, 1.5), and (2.0, 1.5).
   - We can start from the center of this quadrilateral, e.g., (1.75, 1.75).

2. **Goal Set:**
   - The goal set is a quadrilateral with vertices at (9.5, 9.5), (8.5, 9.5), (8.5, 8.5), and (9.5, 8.5).
   - We can aim to reach near the center, e.g., (9.0, 9.0), for a straightforward ending point.

3. **Obstacles:**
   - Obstacles frame the edges of the environment, but they leave an open path through the center.

### Proposed Path
The path can move around the center where there's space between the edges and obstacles:

1. Start at a point inside the start set, e.g., (1.75, 1.75).
2. Move upwards and to the right past the obstacles cornering the area but within the open area present in the center.
3. Head toward the goal by navigating in a relatively straight line while ensuring minimal angular deviation to maintain clearance from the obstacles.

### New Path
Here's a possible path considering these steps, making sure to dodge around the assumed safe open space, ensuring the path never touches any defined obstacles:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start within the start set
    (3.0, 3.0),    # Safely move diagonally out of start bounds towards the open center
    (5.5, 5.5),    # Continue moving in a reasonably straight-line through the open space
    (7.0, 7.0),    # Further progress in a direct manner to approach the goal
    (9.0, 9.0)     # End within the goal set
]
```

This proposed set of waypoints allows a smooth, non-crossing trajectory from the start to the goal, ensuring to maintain a buffer from the edges and indeed staying clear of obstacle frontiers.
