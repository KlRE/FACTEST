# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.0, 1.0], [8.0, 1.0], [8.0, -0.0], [9.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/29/2024 03:15:13 PM] Based on the given start position, goal position, and the location of the obstacle, a potential path can be generated by carefully selecting waypoints that avoid the obstacle and satisfy the requirements. Here is a possible path:

### Analysis:
- **Start Quadrilateral**: The coordinates [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]] define the start area. We can select a starting point that's easily navigated from, such as (0.5, 0.5).
- **Goal Quadrilateral**: Defined by [[9.0, 1.0], [8.0, 1.0], [8.0, 0.0], [9.0, 0.0]], we can select an endpoint like (8.5, 0.5).
- **Obstacle**: The obstacle quadrilateral [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]] poses a vertical barrier stretching from y = -4 to y = 4 along portions of the x-axis. To avoid it, we'll choose a path that stays outside of this range, preferably below y = -4.

### Pathway Strategy:
The path needs to make sure it circumvents the obstacle by selecting waypoints below it (since touching or crossing the obstacle is not allowed).

### Proposed Path:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start within the start quadrilateral
    (1.0, -5.0),  # Move towards the right and below the obstacle
    (6.5, -5.0),  # Continue right, avoiding the lower boundary of the obstacle
    (8.5, 0.5)    # Move diagonally to reach inside the goal quadrilateral
]
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Movement**: Start at (0.5, 0.5) and descend below the obstacle's lower edge, reaching (1.0, -5.0).
- **Horizontal Movement**: Move along y = -5.0 to (6.5, -5.0), making sure to stay clear of the obstacle's edges.
- **Final Diagonal Approach**: Head diagonally upward to (8.5, 0.5), which is inside the goal area.

This proposed path ensures each waypoint connects linearly without intersecting the obstacle while starting and finishing within the specified regions.
