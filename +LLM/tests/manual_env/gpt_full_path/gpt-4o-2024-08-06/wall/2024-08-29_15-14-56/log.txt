# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.0, 1.0], [8.0, 1.0], [8.0, -0.0], [9.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/29/2024 03:15:06 PM] To design a path that navigates from the start position to the goal position while avoiding the obstacle, follow these steps based on the provided data:

### Provided Data for Path Planning

1. **Start Position (Quadrilateral):**
   - Vertices: [(1.0, 1.0), (0.0, 1.0), (0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 0.0)]
   
2. **Goal Position (Quadrilateral):**
   - Vertices: [(9.0, 1.0), (8.0, 1.0), (8.0, 0.0), (9.0, 0.0)]
   
3. **Obstacle:**
   - Obstacle 1 Vertices: [(6.0, 4.0), (2.0, -4.0), (3.0, -4.0), (7.0, 4.0)]

### Analysis

- The **start position** is near the bottom left, and the **goal position** is near the bottom right.
- The **obstacle's position** suggests it covers a region predominantly in the middle horizontally but vertically from y = -4.0 to y = 4.0, effectively blocking a straight-line path between the start and goal.

### Path Planning

We will design a path that mostly moves around the obstacle to the upper part where there is no obstacle interference due to the layout of the start and goal areas:

1. **Select a Start Point:**
   - Choose a middle point in the start area, e.g., (0.5, 0.5).

2. **Move Upwards:**
   - Move to a height above the obstacle, since the obstacle height is up to y = 4.0, choose y = 4.5 as the pathâ€™s elevation. Hence, waypoint (0.5, 4.5).

3. **Move Horizontally Across:**
   - Proceed horizontally from (0.5, 4.5) to pass the clear space (7.0, 4.5).

4. **Move Down to Goal Area:**
   - Descend to the goal starting from (8.5, 0.5).

5. **Enter Goal Position:**
   - Conclude at (8.5, 0.5), ensuring within the goal area.

### Path Output

Based on the analysis, the waypoint path can be defined as follows:

```markdown
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Starting Point
    (0.5, 4.5),  # Move up above the obstacle
    (7.0, 4.5),  # Move right, staying above the obstacle
    (8.5, 0.5)   # Move down and finish in the goal area
]
```

This path ensures avoiding the obstacles and satisfies start and goal conditions.
