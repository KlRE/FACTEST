# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/29/2024 12:08:38 PM] To solve this motion planning task, we need to identify a path that starts within the defined start quadrilateral, ends within the goal quadrilateral, and does not intersect the given obstacles. 

### Start Position: 
The vertices of the start quadrilateral are [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]. We can pick a starting point within this region, considering any internal point that makes navigation easier.

### Goal Position:
The goal quadrilateral is defined by the vertices [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]. The path should end at any point within this quadrilateral.

### Obstacles:
- Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
- Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

### Strategy:
1. Identify clear areas around the obstacles where a path can be planned.
2. Start with a point in the start quadrilateral and plan waypoints avoiding intersections with the obstacles.
3. Reach the goal quadrilateral without touching any obstacle.

### Suggested Path:

1. **Start Point:** Let's choose a point within the start quadrilateral. For simplicity, we will start at (0.2, 0.2).
2. **Waypoint 1:** Move east to avoid the obstacle 2 located to the west and southwest. (0.5, 1.0)
3. **Waypoint 2:** Further move diagonally north-east while avoiding Obstacle 2. (2.0, 1.5)
4. **Waypoint 3:** Head towards a point avoiding the western side of the obstacles. (3.0, 2.0).
5. **End Point:** Choose a suitable endpoint in the goal quadrilateral. (3.5, 2.7).

**Final Path:**

```python
new_path = [
    (0.2, 0.2),  # Start within the start quadrilateral
    (0.5, 1.0),  # Move avoiding Obstacle 2 while gaining height
    (2.0, 1.5),  # Keep a safe distance from Obstacle 2 as you progress towards goal set
    (3.0, 2.0),  # Move toward the gap leading into the goal quadrilateral
    (3.5, 2.7)   # End within the goal quadrilateral
]
```

This path navigates clear of the obstacles, respecting the requirement of not touching them, while starting in the start region and ending in the goal region. Adjust waypoints as needed to ensure practicality and safety.
