# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/29/2024 12:15:49 PM] To plan a path that starts within the start quadrilateral, ends within the goal quadrilateral, and avoids the two obstacles provided, I will describe the spatial layout and select waypoints based on ensuring the path does not intersect with any obstacles.

### Analysis

1. **Start Position Quadrilateral:**  
   - Vertices: \([(-0.5, 0.87), (0.0, -0.0), (0.87, 0.5), (0.37, 1.37)]\)

2. **Goal Position Quadrilateral:**  
   - Vertices: \([(2.96, 2.87), (3.46, 2.0), (4.33, 2.5), (3.83, 3.37)]\)

3. **Obstacles:**
   - Obstacle 1: \([(4.56, 6.1), (-3.23, 1.6), (-2.23, -0.13), (5.56, 4.37)]\)
   - Obstacle 2: \([(-1.73, -1.0), (-0.73, -2.73), (7.06, 1.77), (6.06, 3.5)]\)

The obstacles overlap with a broad area in the coordinates space. To ensure the path remains clear of these obstacles, it must effectively navigate through the open space between them.

### Path Proposal

- Start at a safe interior point in the start quadrilateral.
- Navigate around the obstacles' bounding areas.
- End at a suitable interior point in the goal quadrilateral.

Given this setup, the proposed path is:

#### Proposed Path:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (-0.25, 0.5),     # Start point within the start quadrilateral.
    (0.5, 0.75),      # Move slightly upward and to the right.
    (1.5, 1.0),       # Continue directing clear of obstacle edges.
    (2.0, 2.2),       # Navigate further right avoiding obstacle clearance.
    (3.0, 2.5),       # Advance towards the goal position while staying clear.
    (3.5, 2.7)        # Final endpoint within the goal quadrilateral.
]
```

### Justification:

- **Clearance from Obstacles:** The path avoids directly interacting with any obstacle vertices or edges by navigating through available open spaces in the environments dictated by the positioning of the quadrilaterals.
- **Start and End Alignment:** By selecting interior points within the start and goal quadrilaterals, the path appropriately accomplishes the task requirements.
- **Continuity and Simplicity:** The waypoint selection is designed to facilitate smooth linear transitions, reducing the risk of encountering obstacles through simple and direct linear segments.

This structured path ensures that the linear segments between any two waypoints will not cross or touch any obstacles, fulfilling the defined motion planning task criteria.
