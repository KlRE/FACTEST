# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/29/2024 01:04:28 PM] To design a path from the start set to the goal set while avoiding the obstacles, let's visually analyze the given environment and derive a straightforward sequence of waypoints.

### Provided Data
- **Start Position (Quadrilateral):** 
  - Defined by vertices: \([(1.0, 1.0), (0.0, 1.0), (0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 0.0)]\).
- **Goal Position (Quadrilateral):** 
  - Defined by vertices: \([(5.0, 5.0), (4.0, 5.0), (4.0, 4.0), (5.0, 4.0)]\).
- **Obstacles (Quadrilaterals):**
  - **Obstacle 1:** \([(4.0, 1.0), (2.0, 1.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0)]\)
  - **Obstacle 2:** \([(3.0, 4.0), (-2.0, 4.0), (-2.0, 2.0), (3.0, 2.0)]\)

### Path Analysis
1. **Starting Point Selection:** 
    - Choose a point inside the start quadrilateral. A suitable point is \((0.5, 0.5)\).

2. **Navigating Around Obstacle 1:**
    - Move right past the left side of Obstacle 1 staying above it, slightly adjusting the x-coordinate to avoid contact (+0.1 buffer distance).
    - Navigate vertically past its topmost edge, hence staying above 1.1 units on the y-axis.

3. **Navigating Around Obstacle 2:**
    - After passing Obstacle 1, adjust path towards a point that navigates below the bottom edge of Obstacle 2, ensuring ample buffer by staying below 1.9 units on the y-axis.

4. **Reaching Goal Position:**
    - Move diagonally towards the lower corner of the goal quadrilateral, a direct approach is feasible without intersecting obstacles.

### Constructed Path
Based on the spatial analysis above, here is a proposed path in terms of waypoints:

```python
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Starting within the start set
    (1.9, 1.1),    # Move right up and clear the top of Obstacle 1 while maintaining a safe buffer
    (3.7, 1.2),    # Continue across to avoid the second obstacle
    (4.5, 4.2),    # Approach towards the goal maintaining a safe path to avoid all obstacles
    (4.5, 4.5)     # End in the center of the goal set
]
```

This path is designed considering spatial constraints to ensure no intersections with any obstacles, with strategic waypoint selection facilitating a smooth traversal from the start set to the goal set.
