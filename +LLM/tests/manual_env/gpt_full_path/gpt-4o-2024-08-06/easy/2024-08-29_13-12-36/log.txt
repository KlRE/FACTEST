# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/29/2024 01:12:45 PM] To determine a suitable path from the start set to the goal set while avoiding the specified obstacles, let's analyze the provided data:

### Provided Data:

1. **Start Position (Quadrilateral)**: 
   - Vertices: \([(1.0, 1.0), (0.0, 1.0), (0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 0.0)]\)
   - We can select any point within this quadrilateral as the starting point of our path.

2. **Goal Position (Quadrilateral)**:
   - Vertices: \([(5.0, 5.0), (4.0, 5.0), (4.0, 4.0), (5.0, 4.0)]\)
   - We can select any point within this quadrilateral as the ending point of our path.

3. **Obstacles**:

   **Obstacle 1**: 
   - Vertices: \([(4.0, 1.0), (2.0, 1.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0)]\)
   
   **Obstacle 2**:
   - Vertices: \([(3.0, 4.0), (-2.0, 4.0), (-2.0, 2.0), (3.0, 2.0)]\)

### Path Planning:

- **Path Start**: We can start at \((0.5, 0.5)\), which is comfortably within the start quadrilateral.

- **Path End**: We aim to end at \((4.5, 4.5)\), which is safely within the goal quadrilateral.

Given the layout of the obstacles:

1. **Obstacle 1** spans horizontally between \(x = 2.0\) and \(x = 4.0\) from \(y = 0.0\) to \(y = 1.0\).
2. **Obstacle 2** spans horizontally between \(x = -2.0\) and \(x = 3.0\) from \(y = 2.0\) to \(y = 4.0\).

### Proposed Path:

To avoid crossing Obstacles 1 and 2 and meet the conditions specified, the path should maneuver around these quadrants.

- Starting from \((0.5, 0.5)\)
- Slight curve upwards to avoid obstacle 1, reaching \((0.5, 1.5)\)
- Move horizontally to the right beyond obstacle 1 while staying clear of obstacle 2, reaching \((3.5, 1.5)\)
- Navigating upwards above obstacle 1 but below the top of obstacle 2, moving to \((3.5, 2.5)\)
- Finally, proceeding diagonally towards the goal within the goal set, ending at \((4.5, 4.5)\)

Here's the Path expressed as waypoints:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Starting point
    (0.5, 1.5),    # Move upwards slightly to avoid Obstacle 1
    (3.5, 1.5),    # Move horizontally rightwards above Obstacle 1
    (3.5, 2.5),    # Move upwards into a stable area 
    (4.5, 4.5)     # End in the Goal Set
]
```

This path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles and adheres to the requirement of starting and ending within the given quadrilaterals.
