# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Polygon): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this polygon to start the path.
    Goal Position (Polygon): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this polygon to end the path.
    Obstacles (Polygons):    Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.9999999999999996, 2.0], [2.0, 2.0], [2.0, -0.0], [3.9999999999999996, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[2.0, 3.9999999999999996], [-0.0, 3.9999999999999996], [-0.0, 2.0], [2.0, 2.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

# Motion Planning Task

## Provided Data
    Start Position (Polygon): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this polygon to start the path.
    Goal Position (Polygon): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this polygon to end the path.
    Obstacles (Polygons):    Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.9999999999999996, 2.0], [2.0, 2.0], [2.0, -0.0], [3.9999999999999996, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[2.0, 3.9999999999999996], [-0.0, 3.9999999999999996], [-0.0, 2.0], [2.0, 2.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, -2.5), (2.0, -3.0), (6.5, -3.0), (6.5, 5.5), (4.5, 5.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Incorrect, The path does not end inside the goal set [[5. 5.]
 [4. 5.]
 [4. 4.]
 [5. 4.]].
    Your path does not cross any obstacles
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Goal Position: End within the specified rectangular goal set.

    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

[08/19/2024 03:54:14 PM] ## Analysis of Feedback:

The feedback indicates that the primary issue with the previous path is that it fails to terminate within the designated goal region. Additionally,  while the provided path successfully navigates around obstacles and through a breakpoint, it's essential to ensure it passes through a breakpoint from each set if available. 

## Proposed Path:

 new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, -2.5), (2.0, -3.0), (6.5, -3.0), (6.5, 5.5), (4.5, 4.5)]

## Chain of Thought:

1. **Start Point:** The path starts at (0.5, 0.5), which is inside the start set.
2. **Breakpoint Navigation:** The path correctly utilizes the breakpoint (2.0, -2.5) from Breakpoint Set 1. 
3. **Obstacle Avoidance:** The path successfully maneuvers around Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2 by taking a detour to (6.5, -3.0) and then moving upwards.
4. **Goal Approach:**  Instead of ending at (4.5, 5.5) which is outside the goal set, the new endpoint is shifted to (4.5, 4.5). This adjustment ensures the path terminates within the boundaries of the goal set.

## Justification for Changes:

- The slight modification in the final waypoint from (4.5, 5.5) to (4.5, 4.5) guarantees the path successfully reaches the goal region. This adjustment maintains the obstacle avoidance and breakpoint criteria established in the previous path.
