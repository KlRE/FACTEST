# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/22/2024 08:51:09 AM] To design a path that starts within the given start quadrilateral, ends within the goal quadrilateral, and avoids the defined obstacles, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Identify Start and End Points**:
   - Select a suitable start point within the start quadrilateral.
   - Select an appropriate end point within the goal quadrilateral.

2. **Obstacle Analysis**:
   - Thoroughly understand the positions of the obstacles in relation to start and goal positions.
   - Ensure that the path does not intersect or come too close to the obstacles.

3. **Define Waypoints**:
   - Choose waypoints that construct a safe path from the start to the end.

Given the constraints and provided data, here's a path suggestion:

### Analysis:
- The start quadrilateral has vertices: \([[-0.5, 0.87], [0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]\). Choose a starting point approximately at the center for ease: \((0.2, 0.7)\).
- The goal quadrilateral is \([[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]\). Select a goal point around the center: \((3.64, 2.69)\).
- Avoid the two given obstacles.

### Proposed Safe Path:
1. **Start Position**: \((0.2, 0.7)\), chosen relatively near the geometric center of the start quadrilateral.
2. **Intermediate Waypoints**:
   - Waypoint 1: \((1.0, 1.2)\), heading towards the general direction of the goal while avoiding obstacles.
   - Waypoint 2: \((2.0, 1.5)\), slightly adjust the direction to keep a safe distance from the obstacle.
   - Waypoint 3: \((2.8, 2.0)\), continue progressing towards the goal set, ensuring clearance from obstacles.
3. **End Position**: \((3.64, 2.69)\), as planned in the goal quadrilateral.

### Path Array:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.2, 0.7),  # Start point within the start set
    (1.0, 1.2),  # Intermediate point to ensure a smooth path
    (2.0, 1.5),  # Further transition towards the goal set
    (2.8, 2.0),  # Last intermediate waypoint before reaching goal
    (3.64, 2.69) # End point within the goal set
]
```

### Verification:
- Ensure each segment between waypoints does not intersect the obstacle boundary.
- Adjust waypoints slightly if the path doesn't maintain a safe distance from obstacles.
