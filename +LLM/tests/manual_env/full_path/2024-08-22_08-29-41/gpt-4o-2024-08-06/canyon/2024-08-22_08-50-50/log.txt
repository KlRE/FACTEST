# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/22/2024 08:50:56 AM] To plan a path that avoids obstacles and starts and ends within the provided start and goal sets, we can first choose starting and ending points that meet these conditions. Our task is to ensure that any linear path segment does not intersect or touch the obstacles defined.

### Analysis
1. **Start Set**: A quadrilateral defined by vertices [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]].
2. **Goal Set**: A quadrilateral defined by vertices [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]].
3. **Obstacles**:
   - Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
   - Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

### Path Planning
- **Start Point**: To choose a point within the start set, I will use a central point to ensure it is inside, e.g., (0.18, 0.7).
- **End Point**: From the goal set, choose a point to ensure it is inside, e.g., (3.56, 2.7).

#### Path Segments
1. **Initial Segment**: Start from (0.18, 0.7), this is well within the start region.
2. **Midway Points**: Navigate towards the open areas avoiding obstacle regions:  
   From (0.18, 0.7), a path can be drawn diagonally while gradually ensuring elevation to avoid obstacles, possibly using (1.0, 1.0) and (2.5, 2.3) as waypoints.
3. **Final Segment**: Connect the second-to-last point directly to the goal, making sure the path lies outside obstacle perimeters.

**Final Path Proposal**
To achieve a well-formed path, the following waypoints can be used, balancing directness and obstacle avoidance:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.18, 0.7),    # Start point within the start set
    (1.0, 1.0),     # Gradual move towards the center-right direction, clear of Obstacle 2
    (2.5, 2.3),     # Further progressing through the clear path between obstacles 
    (3.56, 2.7)     # Ending point within the goal set
]
```

### Verification
- This path avoids intersections with the defined obstacles.
- Provides a direct movement from start to end sets, suitable for applications requiring simple linear trajectories.
