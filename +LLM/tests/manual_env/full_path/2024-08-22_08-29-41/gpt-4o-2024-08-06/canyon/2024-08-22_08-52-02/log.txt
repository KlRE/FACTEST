# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/22/2024 08:52:10 AM] To determine a suitable path from the start set to the goal set while avoiding the obstacles, we need a specific path that ensures our waypoints remain outside the boundaries of the obstacles.

### Start and Goal Positions Analysis
- **Start Quadrilateral:** [[-0.5, 0.87], [0.0, 0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
  - Choose a starting point within this set. A reasonable choice could be the center or any distinct point within the given coordinates for convenience.
  - Chosen Start Point: (0.0, 0.5)

- **Goal Quadrilateral:** [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]
  - Choose an ending point within this set. Similarly, a central location or any clear point within boundaries makes it straightforward.
  - Chosen Goal Point: (3.5, 2.5)

### Obstacles Analysis
- **Obstacle 1:** [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
- **Obstacle 2:** [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

Both obstacles have complex shapes and potentially cover significant parts of space between the start and goal positions. It's crucial to navigate from a chosen starting point to the goal point and ensure the path avoids these defined areas using waypoints strategically.

### Path Planning
To develop a path that bypasses these obstacles, consider the relative position of obstacles to pick suitable waypoints.

1. **Start Point:** (0.0, 0.5)
   - Begin at a point clearly within the start quadrilateral.

2. **Waypoint 1:** (1.5, 1.5)
   - Move to the right and slightly upward to navigate above the potential obstructions of Obstacle 2, staying clear of its lower bounds.

3. **Waypoint 2:** (3.0, 2.0)
   - Continue the trajectory towards the goal area while maintaining distance from the boundaries of both obstacles, especially keeping higher than their lowest points reach horizontally.

4. **Goal Point:** (3.5, 2.5)
   - Arrive at the determined goal point, avoiding the hazardous boundaries of both specified obstacles.

### New Path
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.5),    # Start from within start set
    (1.5, 1.5),    # First waypoint, moving toward goal while avoiding obstacles
    (3.0, 2.0),    # Second waypoint, staying clear of obstacles
    (3.5, 2.5)     # End in the goal set
]
```

This path is carefully constructed, ensuring that we maintain a safe distance from defined obstacle regions, effectively connecting the start and goal areas without crossing boundaries.
