# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/22/2024 08:50:19 AM] To create a path from the start set to the goal set while avoiding obstacles, let's analyze the provided data:

### Start Position:
The start position is a quadrilateral with vertices at [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]. We can begin our path from a point within or close to the center of this quadrilateral for simplicity. An approximate central point could be (0.2, 0.6).

### Goal Position:
The goal position is a quadrilateral with vertices at [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]. Similarly, choosing a point in this area for the endpoint, an approximate center could be (3.65, 2.75).

### Obstacles:
1. Obstacle 1 with vertices at [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
2. Obstacle 2 with vertices at [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

### Path Design:
We observe that obstacles cover a significant area, but there is a potential path located more towards the lower right quadrant, avoiding the broad areas occupied by both obstacles.

The following path is proposed:

1. Start at (0.2, 0.6)
2. Move slightly down and right to avoid overlapping with Obstacle 2, reaching (0.5, 1.0).
3. Continue moving diagonally to the right to avoid the lower sections of both obstacles until (2.0, 1.5).
4. Increase in the y-direction slightly while moving to the right towards (3.0, 2.0) to bypass the potential obstacle zones.
5. Finally, move right to (3.65, 2.75) ensuring our path concludes within the goal set.

### Path Output:
The proposed path in the required format is:

```python
new_path = [
    (0.2, 0.6),    # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 1.0),    # Moving diagonally to avoid the lower obstacle region
    (2.0, 1.5),    # Continuing on a path clear from obstacles
    (3.0, 2.0),    # Approaching the goal area while avoiding obstacle 2
    (3.65, 2.75)   # End within the goal set
]
```

This path design is aimed to be free from crossing any obstacles and ensures staying clear of their boundaries, starting from the designated start set and concluding within the goal set.
