# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/22/2024 08:51:03 AM] Given the provided data for the start and goal positions and the obstacles, we need to design a path from a point within the start position to a point within the goal position, ensuring the path avoids the given obstacles.

**Analysis and Path Planning:**

### Start and Goal Positions:
- **Start Position:** A quadrilateral designated by the points: `[-0.5, 0.87], [0.0, 0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]`. We can select any point inside this shape. We may start near its center for simplicity and maneuverability.
- **Goal Position:** Defined by vertices: `[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]`. Again, any point within this quadrilateral can be chosen as the end point.

### Obstacles:
1. **Obstacle 1:** `[[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]`
2. **Obstacle 2:** `[[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]`

### Path Design:
We need to find a series of waypoints that guide the path from the start to the goal while avoiding the obstacles.

1. **Choosing Start Point:** Let's begin near the center of the start quadrilateral `[0.5, 0.5]`.
2. **Choosing Goal Point:** Finish at a point within the goal that avoids straight-line intersections with obstacles `[3.5, 3.0]`.

#### Series of Waypoints:
- Start at a safe position well within the start quadrilateral.
- Move horizontally and/or vertically around the densest cluster of obstacles, making use of open areas while maintaining clearance from obstacles.
- Enter the goal area safely without intersecting obstacles.

**Proposed Path:**

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Starting inside the start position
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Move diagonally up-right to bypass direct initial obstacles
    (2.0, 1.5),   # Continue rightward maintaining safe clearance from obstacles
    (2.5, 2.0),   # Move diagonally towards the goal safe zone
    (3.5, 3.0)    # End inside the goal position
]
```

**Note:** The chosen waypoints are tentative and based on visualizing the path constraints. Adjustments may be needed upon further consideration of the spatial arrangement or exact dimensions of obstacles. The path's trajectory ensures it does not intersect any given obstacles while transitioning smoothly and directly within the permissible areas.
