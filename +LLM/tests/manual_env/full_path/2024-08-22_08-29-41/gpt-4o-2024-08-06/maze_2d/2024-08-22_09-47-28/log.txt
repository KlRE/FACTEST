[08/22/2024 09:47:35 AM] To solve the motion planning task, let's first analyze the provided data. We need to determine a path from the start position to the goal position while avoiding the obstacles.

### Provided Data Analysis

#### Start Position
- Quadrilateral vertices: [[0.6, 3.6], [0.4, 3.6], [0.4, 3.4], [0.6, 3.4]]
- We can start at the center of this quadrilateral: (0.5, 3.5)

#### Goal Position
- Quadrilateral vertices: [[6.75, 5.0], [6.25, 5.0], [6.25, 4.5], [6.75, 4.5]]
- We can end at the center of this quadrilateral: (6.5, 4.75)

#### Obstacles
Analyzing the list of 18 obstacles, we want to avoid any path that intersects with any of these quadrilateral-shaped obstacles. We'll assume a simplified navigation through the gaps between the obstacles without touching their edges.

### Pathway Planning
To successfully navigate from the start position to the goal position, we need to plot a path that navigates around or through gaps between these obstacles.

1. **Start at the center of the start position:** (0.5, 3.5)

2. **Navigate upwards and rightwards to avoid the nearby vertical obstacles (3, 15, 16, etc.) from the start:** Move close to (1.0, 4.0)

3. **Navigate rightwards safely between the obstacles (4, 8, 5, 6, etc.):** Move towards (3.0, 4.0)

4. **Continue navigating around to avoid obstacle 10 and those surrounding it, ensuring not to cross over any lines:** Pass through a higher y-coordinate gap, such as (5.0, 4.25) to avoid touching obstacles on both sides.

5. **End at the center of the goal position:** (6.5, 4.75)

### Proposed Path
Now, I will provide the path that satisfies these constraints:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5), # Starting in the start set at its center
    (1.0, 4.0), # Move up and to the right, staying clear of nearby obstacles
    (3.0, 4.0), # Proceed towards the right, through gaps avoiding any obstacle edges
    (5.0, 4.25), # Position ourselves between obstacle 10 and those above it
    (6.5, 4.75) # Ending inside the goal set at its center
]
```

This path avoids crossing or touching any obstacles based on a strategic advancement through available safe zones between obstacles. It begins and ends within the designated quadrilaterals for the start and goal positions, respectively.

[08/22/2024 09:47:45 AM] To address the feedback and modify the path to avoid intersecting obstacles, let's analyze the environment and devise a new path:

1. **Start Analysis**: The original path begins at (0.5, 3.5), within the defined start set. Since this point is valid, we'll keep it as the starting point.

2. **Segment 1 Analysis (0.5, 3.5) to (1.0, 4.0)**: The first segment intersects with Obstacle 2. This obstacle spans horizontally at y=4.0, which forces our path to start by moving vertically or around the obstacle entirely.

3. **Segment 2 Analysis (1.0, 4.0) to (3.0, 4.0)**: This segment is invalid because it lies completely on Obstacle 2 and also intersects Obstacle 8. A new trajectory is necessary, either by descending below the obstacle or going vertically above and around it.

4. **Segment 3 Analysis (3.0, 4.0) to (5.0, 4.25)**: This segment intersects again with Obstacle 2. Since it also grazes Obstacle 8, an entirely different route needs to navigate these blocks.

5. **Segment 4 Analysis (5.0, 4.25) to (6.5, 4.75)**: This segment traverses Obstacle 12. The solution is to ensure the path has a clear vertical gap or route adjustment to bypass this obstacle safely.

### Revised Path:
To bypass these obstacles while following the path requirements (beginning in the start set, avoiding obstacles, and ending in the goal set), below is a proposed new route:

1. Start at (0.5, 3.5), the original starting point.
2. Move horizontally left to (0.4, 3.5) to navigate around the left side of Obstacle 2.
3. Move upwards to (0.4, 4.2), staying clear above Obstacle 2.
4. Move right to (5.1, 4.2) to go around the top side of Obstacle 2 and avoid Obstacle 8.
5. Continue moving to (6.6, 4.2), passing above Obstacle 12.
6. Finally, descend slightly to reach the goal area at (6.5, 4.75).

This path safely navigates around the obstacles, ensuring no intersection occurs, and ends within the designated goal set.

[08/22/2024 09:47:56 AM] To address the issue with the fourth segment intersecting Obstacle 12, I need to identify an alternative route that maintains clearance from this obstacle.

### Analysis and Adjustments:

1. **Starting Point and Segment 1 (from (0.5, 3.5) to (0.4, 3.5))**: This segment correctly starts within the start set and moves slightly horizontally. There are no obstacles to consider here.

2. **Segment 2 (from (0.4, 3.5) to (0.4, 4.2))**: This segment moves vertically upwards, which helps avoid obstacles, notably clearing Obstacle 3, 4, 5, 8, and 15.

3. **Segment 3 (from (0.4, 4.2) to (5.1, 4.2))**: This horizontal movement towards the goal helps evade lower-lying obstacles. There’s no intersection here, as it stays clear above obstacles 4, 5, and 6.

4. **Segment 4 (from (5.1, 4.2) to (6.6, 4.2))**: The feedback indicates this segment intersects Obstacle 12. To adjust, the path should skirt around the right perimeter of this obstacle. Hence, the path must rise above Obstacle 12 and then head towards the endpoint in the goal set.

5. **Segment 5 (from (6.6, 4.2) to (6.5, 4.75))**: This segment ends within the goal set, which is correct. However, it must be adjusted to follow the corrected fourth segment.

### New Path:

To resolve the conflict with Obstacle 12 while maintaining the start and end points, I'll adjust as follows:

- **Segment 4 Adjustment (Path deviation around Obstacle 12)**: From (5.1, 4.2), ascend slightly above the obstacle reaching (5.9, 4.2), then head towards (5.9, 4.6) to ensure it clears the obstacle’s height.

- **Segment 5 New Endpoint**: From this safe elevation, move right to the goal at (6.5, 4.75).

Implementing these considerations results in a path that carefully skirts obstacles while meeting the path requirements:

### New Path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),  # Start in the start set
    (0.4, 3.5),  # Slight horizontal move
    (0.4, 4.2),  # Move upward to avoid lower obstacles
    (5.1, 4.2),  # Horizontal towards the obstacle-free zone
    (5.9, 4.2),  # Ascend to skirt around Obstacle 12
    (5.9, 4.6),  # Reside above Obstacle 12 height
    (6.5, 4.75)  # End in the goal set
]
```

By selecting a detour around Obstacle 12's constraints, we maintain the integrity of non-crossing with the obstacles, assuring a clear path from start to finish.

[08/22/2024 09:48:07 AM] To address the feedback and ensure the path does not intersect with any obstacles, let’s analyze the current path and make necessary adjustments.

### Current Path Analysis
The given path is as follows:
```
path = [(0.5, 3.5), (0.4, 3.5), (0.4, 4.2), (5.1, 4.2), (5.9, 4.2), (5.9, 4.6), (6.5, 4.75)]
```

1. **Initial Segments:**
   - The path starts correctly within the start set.
   - Moves from (0.5, 3.5) to (0.4, 4.2) without crossing any obstacles, as these are vertical movements near the start point.

2. **Troublesome Segments:**
   - Segment 4: From (5.1, 4.2) to (5.9, 4.2) - intersects with Obstacle 12.
   - Segment 5: From (5.9, 4.2) to (5.9, 4.6) - also intersects with Obstacle 12.
   - Segment 6: From (5.9, 4.6) to (6.5, 4.75) - further intersects with Obstacle 12.

### Adjustments
Our goal is to reroute these sections to bypass Obstacle 12 while maintaining connectivity between waypoints and ultimately reaching the goal point.

1. **Avoiding Obstacle 12:**
   - Instead of moving horizontally at y = 4.2, slightly raise the y-coordinate to navigate around the top of Obstacle 12.
   - Go beyond the right edge of Obstacle 12 before dropping downwards to connect to (6.5, 4.75) in the goal area.

### Proposed Path
By making these adjustments, the new proposed path should successfully avoid intersections with Obstacle 12:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),      # Start within the start set
    (0.4, 3.5),      # Move slightly to the start set boundary
    (0.4, 4.2),      # Move upwards to prepare for bypass
    (5.0, 4.5),      # Move right, above Obstacle 12
    (6.0, 4.5),      # Move further right, clear past Obstacle 12
    (6.0, 4.75),     # Move into goal area vertically
    (6.5, 4.75)      # Final move towards the goal set
]
```

### Final Notes
- This path moves directly past the top edge of Obstacle 12, ensuring safe passage around it without intersection.
- Ensure that each waypoint transition clears the obstacle boundaries by a safe margin, providing clear navigation through the environment.

[08/22/2024 09:48:18 AM] To address the feedback and correct the initial path, it's important to scrutinize the reasons behind the intersections with Obstacle 12 and identify viable waypoints that can bypass it effectively. Here’s a structured breakdown of the thought process:

### Start and Goal Analysis
- **Start Position**: Correctly starts at a point within the start quadrilateral, `(0.5, 3.5)`.
- **Goal Position**: Correctly ends within the goal quadrilateral at `(6.5, 4.75)`.

### Obstacle Intersections
1. **Segment 4 (5.0, 4.5) to (6.0, 4.5)** - This line runs horizontally and intersects with the vertical boundary of Obstacle 12, specifically the segment between (5.9, 4.5) and (6.0, 5.0).
2. **Segment 5 (6.0, 4.5) to (6.0, 4.75)** - This segment is vertically aligned and coincides with the left boundary of Obstacle 12.
3. **Segment 6 (6.0, 4.75) to (6.5, 4.75)** - This section attempts to approach the goal quadrilateral but infringes on the horizontal boundary of Obstacle 12.

### Adjusted Path Planning
The solution should involve navigating around Obstacle 12 while ensuring a smooth connection to the goal area.

### Revised Path Strategy
1. **From (5.0, 4.5) to a New Safe Point (5.9, 4.5)**:
   - Begin by altering the endpoint slightly before the problematic boundary of Obstacle 12 by using `(5.9, 4.5)` instead of `(6.0, 4.5)` to avoid crossing the boundary.
   
2. **Bypass Obstacle 12 by Moving Vertically: (5.9, 4.5) to (5.9, 4.8)**:
   - Shift vertically upwards by `0.3` units to maneuver around the northern bound of Obstacle 12 safely.

3. **Move Toward the Goal: (5.9, 4.8) to (6.6, 4.8)**:
   - Stretch this segment to the goal set ensuring a safe clearance past Obstacle 12.

### New Path Proposal
By implementing these adjustments, we derive a collision-free path that maintains a safe distance from all obstacles:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),     # Start point within the start set
    (0.4, 3.5),     # Navigate up at the allowed boundary
    (0.4, 4.2),     # Move upwards further along the safe corridor
    (5.0, 4.5),     # Approach the problematic area cautiously
    (5.9, 4.5),     # Adjusted point to avoid Obstacle 12
    (5.9, 4.8),     # Vertical detour to steer clear of the obstacle
    (6.6, 4.8)      # End point within the goal set beyond Obstacle 12’s interference 
]
```

This approach skillfully navigates the path through the environment, evading all intersections with obstacles while starting and ending at valid locations.

[08/22/2024 09:48:25 AM] To resolve the issues with the original path, we need to carefully avoid the intersections with Obstacle 12, which was a problem with segments 4, 5, and 6. Let's break down the steps involved in revising the path.

1. **Starting Point and Initial Coordinates**: The path begins at (0.5, 3.5), which is within the start set.

2. **Route Planning**:

   - **Segment 1**: The path moves to (0.4, 3.5). This initial change in coordinates is acceptable as it doesn't intersect any obstacles. 
   
   - **Segment 2**: From (0.4, 3.5), the path continues to (0.4, 4.2), taking it upwards and outside the bounds of Obstacle 2.
   
   - **Segment 3**: From (0.4, 4.2), the path moves to (5, 4.5). We must reroute this path to avoid running into obstacles when transitioning.
   
   - **Segment 4**: From the previous path endpoint (5.0, 4.5), moving to (5.9, 4.5) intersects with Obstacle 12. To avoid this, we consider bypassing the obstacle by moving south and then east.

3. **Adjusting the Route**:
   
   To avoid Obstacle 12 which created multiple intersections, the path should be adjusted around it. Let's plot an alternate path:

   - **Intermediate Waypoints**: Make use of a route that couches around the southern part of Obstacle 12. To do this, consider adding a waypoint like (5.0, 4.2) where it veers southward just before reaching Obstacle 12's vicinity.
   
   - **New Segment Approach**: Continuing from there, move towards point (6.2, 4.2) to skirt around the southern perimeter of Obstacle 12 safely. This gives enough buffer (as the southern coordinate for Obstacle 12 reaches up to 2.0) while moving eastward.

   - **Final Approach**: Next, move northwards to (6.6, 4.8) so as to reach the vicinity of the goal quadrant, ensuring the endpoint coincides within goal set.

4. **New Path Construction**:
   
   Implementing the careful consideration for obstacle avoidance and waypoint choosing, the newly proposed path would be:

```python
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),  # start within the start set
    (0.4, 3.5),  # move slightly leftwards to progress
    (0.4, 4.2),  # move upwards to circumvent Obstacle 2
    (5.0, 4.2),  # move towards east, staying away from the obstacles
    (6.2, 4.2),  # continue moving eastwards while circumventing obstacle 12
    (6.6, 4.8),  # move north-east finishing in the goal set
]
```

By designing the path this way, all intersecting issues are resolved while maintaining both start and goal conditions.

[08/22/2024 09:48:34 AM] ### Thought Process

1. **Understanding the Environment:**
   - The start position is a quadrilateral around the point (0.5, 3.5), while the goal position is a quadrilateral around the point (6.6, 4.8). These ranges give us some flexibility in placing waypoints.
   - The path we need should avoid intersecting with any of the obstacles listed. Our initial path intersects Obstacle 12 between the points (5.0, 4.2) and (6.2, 4.2).

2. **Analyzing the Problematic Segment:**
   - Obstacle 12 is described by the points [[6.0, 5.0], [5.9, 5.0], [5.9, 2.0], [6.0, 2.0]]. The segment from (5.0, 4.2) to (6.2, 4.2) intersects this obstacle.
   - To avoid this obstacle, I need to adjust the path, either by going around the top or bottom of the obstacle, considering the height of the obstacle (from coordinates y=2.0 to y=5.0) and its width (from x=5.9 to x=6.0).

3. **Adjusting the Path:**
   - The vertical range of Obstacle 12 suggests moving either higher than y=5.0 or lower than y=2.0.
   - Given that the final destination is within a quadrilateral reaching y=4.5, going above y=5.0 could unnecessarily complicate the path. Hence, I'll consider moving below y=2.0.

4. **Proposing a New Path:**
   - Start from (0.5, 3.5) within the start area.
   - Continue vertically to (0.4, 3.5) – within the start set, ensuring a wide avoidance of Obstacle 3.
   - Move horizontally to the right to (0.4, 1.8), going below Obstacle 12. This avoids collisions vertically and gives a clear path under the obstacle.
   - Continue horizontally and adjust vertically at (6.0, 1.8) to position closer to the goal without collision.
   - Then, proceed vertically up to (6.6, 4.8) to reach the goal set safely.

### New Path

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),  # Start in the start set
    (0.4, 3.5),
    (0.4, 1.8),  # Go below Obstacle 12
    (6.0, 1.8),  # Move horizontally while keeping clear of obstacles
    (6.6, 4.8)   # End in the goal set
]
```

This new composed path maintains a safe distance from all detected obstacles and utilizes open areas around and below the detour zones, ensuring non-intersection with any obstacle.

[08/22/2024 09:48:41 AM] To correct the path ensuring it avoids intersecting any obstacles, I have examined the spatial relationships between the defined obstacles and the segments of the path. From the feedback, we know that the segment between (0.4, 1.8) and (6.0, 1.8) intersects Obstacle 7.

### Thought Process:

1. **Start to First Point**: The path begins at (0.5, 3.5), inside the start set, and moves to (0.4, 3.5). These points are safe and avoid any obstacles.

2. **Path to Avoid Segment Intersection**: The problematic segment is the straight line between (0.4, 1.8) and (6.0, 1.8):
   - **Obstacle 7** spans from y=1.0 to y=3.0 along x=3.9 to x=4.0, meaning that the y=1.8 line would intersect it horizontally. 
   - We need to introduce waypoints to circumvent this obstacle. One option is to slightly detour around Obstacle 7 by passing above it before returning to a lower y-coordinate.

3. **Adjusting Path**:
   - From (0.4, 3.5), descend almost vertically to (0.4, 3.1) to stay clear of Obstacle 7's upper bound.
   - Moving rightward, add a waypoint close to Obstacle 8's lower bound while avoiding it, so consider (3.8, 3.1).
   - Continue horizontally to bypass completely around Obstacle 7, reaching (4.2, 3.1) before descending back to the desired y=1.8 path to avoid intersecting with Obstacle 10.
   - Finally, the path should move horizontally to (6.0, 1.8) before ascending to the goal at (6.6, 4.8).

By doing this, we remain clear of Obstacle 7, while still maintaining a feasible route to the goal position.

### New Path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),  # Start inside the start set
    (0.4, 3.5),  # Initial approach
    (0.4, 3.1),  # Begin descending, avoiding Obstacle 7
    (3.8, 3.1),  # Rightward move avoiding crossing into Obstacle 8
    (4.2, 3.1),  # Bypass the problematic intersection segment of Obstacle 7
    (6.0, 1.8),  # Come back to the previous intended line towards the goal
    (6.6, 4.8)   # End inside the goal set
]
```

This path satisfies the start and goal conditions while ensuring no segment crosses any obstacles.

[08/22/2024 09:48:51 AM] To correct the given path and ensure that it does not intersect with any obstacles, let's analyze the invalid segments and adjust the waypoints accordingly.

### Analysis of Provided Path

1. **Path Validity Check**:
   - Segment 3: Between (0.4, 3.1) and (3.8, 3.1), it intersects with Obstacle 8.
   - Segment 5: Between (4.2, 3.1) and (6.0, 1.8), it intersects with Obstacle 10 and Obstacle 11.

### Adjustments to the Path

**Segment 3 Adjustment**:
- The segment from (0.4, 3.1) to (3.8, 3.1) crosses Obstacle 8. Since Obstacle 8 is located between x=2.9 to x=3.0 and y=3.0 to y=4.0, we need to move this segment downwards in the y-direction to avoid crossing the obstacle.

**Segment 5 Adjustment**:
- The path from (4.2, 3.1) to (6.0, 1.8) crosses Obstacle 10 and 11. The obstacles are located near the lower x-values between 4.9 to 6.0 and heights 1.9 to 4.0. Moving upwards and then hugging the right side might help to avoid these obstacles.

### Proposed Path Modifications
Starting with the adjusted points, the path will be adapted as follows:

1. **Start at (0.5, 3.5)** (start set).
2. **Move to (0.4, 3.0)**: This avoids crossing Obstacle 8 by staying below its y-boundary.
3. **Move to (3.8, 3.0)**: Maintain this straight line, avoiding all obstacles by staying just below the Obstacle 8.
4. **Move to (4.3, 3.5)**: Move upwards slightly to get between Obstacle 10 and bypassing Obstacle 11.
5. **Move to (5.85, 2.0)**: Bypass the lower boundary of Obstacle 12, distancing from Obstacles 10 and 11.
6. **Move to (6.6, 4.8)**: Finally navigate towards the goal set avoiding the remaining obstacles.

### New Path

The new path that avoids the obstacles effectively is:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),  # starting point inside the start set
    (0.4, 3.0),  # avoids the lower boundary of Obstacle 8
    (3.8, 3.0),  # progresses straight, avoid touching Obstacle 8.
    (4.3, 3.5),  # move upwards and between obstacles
    (5.85, 2.0), # navigating around the bottom of Obstacle 12
    (6.6, 4.8)   # finally ending at the goal set
]
```

This proposed path starts and ends within the required sets and safely navigates between the obstacles without intersecting any of them.

[08/22/2024 09:48:59 AM] In the original path provided, the main issues relate to intersecting with obstacles, especially in segments between specific waypoints. Let’s go through the analysis and provide an updated path.

### Analysis and Reasoning

1. **Start Point: (0.5, 3.5)**
   - Originates correctly within the start set.

2. **Segment 1 from (0.5, 3.5) to (0.4, 3.0):**
   - No problems reported, but note the segment passes near Obstacle 3.

3. **Segment 2 between (0.4, 3.0) and (3.8, 3.0):**
   - Intersects with obstacles 3, 4, 5, and 8. This indicates that a direct horizontal path at y=3.0 is problematic.

4. **Segment 3 from (3.8, 3.0) to (4.3, 3.5):**
   - No reported intersection, but close to the obstacle borders.

5. **Segment 4 between (4.3, 3.5) and (5.85, 2.0):**
   - Intersects with obstacles 10 and 11. A downward diagonal line is cutting these obstacles, so a change is necessary.

6. **Segment 5 from (5.85, 2.0) to (6.6, 4.8):**
   - Intersects with obstacles 11 and 12. 

### Plan Revision

To avoid intersecting obstacles, I will adjust the path by rerouting around these obstacles and adding more waypoints to maintain clearance:

- **Beginning:** Start higher within the start set to avoid obstacles 3, 4, and 5 early.
- **Redirecting Segment 2:** Navigate vertically up and follow the top edge of obstacle 8 to circumvent it.
- **Bypass Segment 4:** Avoid diagonal cut through crowded area by detouring around obstacles 10 and 11.
- **Final Approach:** Consider gaps and paths that go around obstructions for the final stretch to avoid obstacles 11 and 12.

### Revised Path

new_path = [
   (0.5, 3.5),   # Start within the given start area
   (0.5, 3.8),   # Move upwards to avoid Obstacle 3, 4, 5's horizontal plane
   (2.5, 3.8),   # Move right below and avoid Obstacle 8
   (2.5, 3.4),   # Start descending to stay clear of Obstacle 6's range
   (3.4, 3.4),   # Avoids Obstacle 8 and heads towards clearer path
   (3.4, 5.0),   # Bypass obstacles 10 and 11 
   (6.0, 5.0),   # Move around Obstacle 12 
   (6.6, 4.8)    # End within the goal area
]

This path seeks to avoid the identified problematic regions while ensuring we start and end in the designated areas.

[08/22/2024 09:49:13 AM] To rectify the current path and avoid obstacle intersections, I need to carefully study the spatial relationships between the waypoints and the obstacles. The previous path intersects with several obstacles due to improper alignment with their boundaries.

### Analysis and Adjustments

1. **Initial Path Analysis**:
   - The original path started from the start set correctly and ended in the goal set correctly.
   - Segment 4 from (2.5, 3.4) to (3.4, 3.4) intersects with Obstacle 8.
   - Segment 5 from (3.4, 3.4) to (3.4, 5.0) intersects with Obstacles 2 and 17.
   - Segment 6 from (3.4, 5.0) to (6.0, 5.0) intersects with Obstacles 12 and 17.
   - Segment 7 from (6.0, 5.0) to (6.6, 4.8) intersects with Obstacles 12 and 17.

2. **Planning the New Path**:
   - **Segment from Start**: Begin from a point like (0.5, 3.5) within the start set. This is a neutral starting point.
   - **Avoid Obstacle 8**: Move upwards initially to circumvent Obstacle 8 by increasing the y-coordinate, like (2.5, 3.3), staying below the boundary of Obstacle 8.
   - **Avoid Obstacles 2 and 17**: Move vertically slightly closer to the left and avoid the obstacle field created by Obstacles 2 and 17 by adjusting the vertical path to (3.0, 3.2).
   - **Clear Obstacle 17**: Since this large obstacle impedes easy passage, adjust by navigating around it at a y-coordinate below 4.9 and safely to the right.
   - **Proceed to the Goal through Safe Passage**: After bypassing critical obstacles, traverse towards the goal set by using waypoints like (5.5, 4.2). This trajectory maintains clearance from potential intersecting boundaries of obstacles.

3. **New Path Proposal**:
   - Carefully navigate around the wider obstacle at the bottom by maintaining a higher y-coordinate.
   - Last segment to the Goal: Choose a path that ensures the end in the goal set region, like (6.5, 4.75).

### Proposed New Path:
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),  # Starting point within start set
    (2.5, 3.3),  # Move up a bit to avoid obstacle 8
    (3.0, 3.2),  # Navigate wisely to avoid obstacle 2
    (3.5, 3.5),  # Strategic point to keep clear of obstacle 17
    (5.5, 4.2),  # Proceed keeping distance from obstacles
    (6.5, 4.75)  # Ending correctly within the goal set
]
```

This path is constructed to maneuver around the obstacles strategically, ensuring no intersections occur while maintaining appropriate entry to the goal set.

[08/22/2024 09:49:25 AM] To plan an updated path that avoids intersecting the obstacles, let's analyze the feedback and adjust the path.

### Feedback Analysis

1. **Segment 2:** Between (2.5, 3.3) and (3.0, 3.2) intersects with Obstacle 8.  
   **Obstacle 8** is at [[3.0, 4.0], [2.9, 4.0], [2.9, 3.0], [3.0, 3.0]]. This means the path enters the vertical boundary between y=3.0 and y=4.0 at x~2.9-3.0 of the obstacle. 

2. **Segment 3:** Between (3.0, 3.2) and (3.5, 3.5) still affects Obstacle 8. The coordinates indicate it needs to avoid the region just barely touching or outflanking the top of Obstacle 8.

3. **Segment 4:** Between (3.5, 3.5) and (5.5, 4.2) crosses Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 10.  
   - **Obstacle 2** is at [[5.0, 4.0], [1.0, 4.0], [1.0, 3.9], [5.0, 3.9]]. The path crosses this horizontal boundary from y=3.9 to y=4.0. 
   - **Obstacle 10** lies at [[5.0, 4.0], [4.9, 4.0], [4.9, 2.0], [5.0, 2.0]]. The presence of path pushing into the area through the bottom left corner at (4.9, 2.0) is what causes the intersection.

4. **Segment 5:** Between (5.5, 4.2) and (6.5, 4.75) intersects with Obstacle 12.  
   **Obstacle 12** is between [[6.0, 5.0], [5.9, 5.0], [5.9, 2.0], [6.0, 2.0]]. This path almost cuts across from degrees rightward. 

### Revised Path

To implement a non-crossing route by adjusting the path:

- Start at a verified point within the start set: **(0.5, 3.5)**
- Move to the right while slightly upward for a gap between Obstacle 8 (y=4): **(2.9, 3.0)**
- Bypass the top boundary of Obstacle 8, keeping enough clearance: **(3.0, 3.1)** 
- Utilize space to go around Obstacle 8 baseline of y=3.0 and through low junction of Obstacle 2 & 10: **(4.7, 3.2)**
- Avoid higher stretch of Obstacle 12 by ascending over obstacle clearance: **(5.8, 4.5)**
- Conclude in the documented zone inside the goal set: **(6.5, 4.75)**

This results in a spatially informed escape route making sure no part crosses directly in any obstacle's zone.

[08/22/2024 09:49:34 AM] To create a new path that avoids intersecting any obstacles, we need to adjust the waypoints and consider the spatial relationships of both the existing and new obstacles. Let's address each problematic segment identified in the feedback and create a clear path:

### Problematic Segments and Analysis:

1. **Segment 1: (0.5, 3.5) to (2.9, 3.0)**
    - This line intersects with Obstacle 8. One way to avoid this is to start further to the top, moving mostly horizontally around Obstacle 8.

2. **Segment 2: (2.9, 3.0) to (3.4, 3.0)**
    - This segment also intersects with Obstacle 8. Therefore, our adjustments from the starting point should already place the path above this obstacle.

3. **Segment 4: (4.7, 3.2) to (5.8, 4.5)**
    - This line intersects with Obstacle 10. We can adjust the path to bypass this obstacle by moving more horizontally and then vertically.

4. **Segment 5: (5.8, 4.5) to (6.5, 4.75)**
    - This line intersects with Obstacle 12. We should ensure the path moves close to the edge or above the obstacle.

### Adjusted Path:

- Start at (0.5, 3.5), but move slightly up to avoid the obstacle, ensuring clearance.
- Progress horizontally to clear above Obstacle 8, so the path doesn't intersect at its (2.9,3.0) vertex.
- Continue further horizontally to the right past Obstacle 10.
- Upon reaching a clear passage, move down or up strategically to reach the goal.

### New Path Plan:

To bypass the noted obstacles, we plan:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),   # Start inside the start set
    (2.5, 3.8),   # Move to a safe height above Obstacle 8
    (3.2, 3.8),   # Clear Obstacle 8 horizontally
    (4.8, 3.8),   # Move horizontally to avoid Obstacle 10
    (5.6, 4.6),   # Vertically adjust upwards near Obstacle 10 for safety
    (6.5, 4.75)   # End within the goal set
]
```

### Explanation:

- The first waypoint adjustment to (2.5, 3.8) ensures the path is clear from Obstacle 8 by maintaining more subtle upward progress.
- Continuing horizontally helps avoid collision with multiple obstacles, particularly staying clear above Obstacle 10.
- A slight vertical adjustment as we approach the goal helps circumvent potential interference from Obstacle 12.
- This path accounts for ensuring sufficient distance from each obstacle, observing any changes as we plot around edges smoothly.

[08/22/2024 09:49:44 AM] To correct the path and avoid intersecting obstacles, we need to closely analyze the path segments and their interactions with the aforementioned obstacles:

### Analysis
1. **Initial Segment: (0.5, 3.5) to (2.5, 3.8)**
   - This segment is clear of any known obstacles.

2. **Problematic Segment: (2.5, 3.8) to (3.2, 3.8)**
   - This segment intersects with Obstacle 8. To avoid this, the segment should be adjusted such that we pass around the obstacle while maintaining a safe clearance.

3. **Segment: (3.2, 3.8) to (4.8, 3.8)**
   - Once the previous issue is resolved, this segment stays clear as the pathway essentially skirts any potential intersection with obstacles.

4. **Problematic Segment: (4.8, 3.8) to (5.6, 4.6)**
   - This segment intersects with Obstacles 2 and 10. One way to avoid this would be to bypass below the obstacles entirely, or navigate a path above the obstacle at a more considerable height.

5. **Problematic Segment: (5.6, 4.6) to (6.5, 4.75)**
   - This intersects with Obstacle 12. We must ensure clearance over or around this obstacle, maintaining avoidance of its influence.

### Revised Path Plan
We will introduce new waypoints around the problematic intersections and keep clear of obstacle boundaries, ensuring we adhere to the starting and ending points:

1. **Start** at (0.5, 3.5) within the start set.
2. Move upward and slightly right proactively to avoid contacts with Obstacle 8; this takes our waypoint to (2.5, 4.0).
3. From this vantage point, proceed to circumvent below Obstacle 8, progressing to (3.5, 4.0).
4. Navigate to (3.5, 3.5), allowing us clearance beneath Obstacle 8 and alongside Obstacle 7.
5. From there, progress rightward to (4.8, 3.5), successfully sidestepping lower obstacles.
6. Move upward avoiding overlap with Obstacle 10 and traveling vertically to bypass it entirely, proceeding to (4.8, 4.2).
7. With the path now clear of intersecting obstacles, a straightforward segment takes us then from (4.8, 4.2) to (6.5, 4.75), arriving securely in the goal set.

### New Path
Given the revisions for obstacle avoidance and adherence to the problem constraints:

```python
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),  # Starting point
    (2.5, 4.0),  # Adjust upward to dodge Obstacle 8
    (3.5, 4.0),  # Progress right, navigating around Obstacle 8
    (3.5, 3.5),  # Drop down below any interfering obstacles
    (4.8, 3.5),  # Clear path moving right
    (4.8, 4.2),  # Ascend, bypassing Obstacle 10
    (6.5, 4.75)  # Final move into the goal set
]
```

This path considers a strategic motion that carefully adheres to the problem requirements, ensuring valid entry into the starting and goal positions while maintaining necessary avoidance of obstacle intersections.

[08/22/2024 09:49:52 AM] To create a new path that avoids intersecting the obstacles, we need to carefully analyze the given spatial environment, ensuring that the waypoints we choose result in linear segments that do not intersect with any obstacles. 

### Analysis of the Provided Path Feedback:
1. **Initial Segment Analysis**: The initial segment from (0.5, 3.5) to (2.5, 4.0) crosses Obstacle 2, as this obstacle represents a horizontal band around y = 4.0 extending from x = 1.0 to x = 5.0. Thus, this segment needs to be modified to either move above y = 4.0 or below y = 3.9 before reaching x = 1.0.

2. **Horizontal Segment Issues**: The segment from (2.5, 4.0) to (3.5, 4.0) also intersects Obstacle 2, which occupies the entire y = 4.0 level. Again, this requires avoiding the y = 4.0 line until we are clear of the obstacle.

3. **Vertical and Diagonal Segment Issues**: The segments such as (3.5, 4.0) to (3.5, 3.5) and others that rise up to (4.8, 4.2), intersect with Obstacle 2 at y = 4 and also with Obstacle 12 closer to the goal region. Special attention should be given to navigating vertically or diagonally in areas dense with obstacles.

### Spatial Strategy Development:
- **Avoiding Lower and Upper Blockades**: 
   - Move the path below the lower bound of Obstacle 2 to avoid intersecting it and safely navigate past its boundaries.
   - Move above possible intersection heights for higher x-values when encountering obstacles like Obstacle 12 near the target goal region.

### New Path Design:
1. **Starting within Start Set**: Begin at (0.5, 3.5), a point safely within the start configuration.
2. **Navigating Below Obstacle 2**: Move to below the y = 3.9 line (for instance, y = 3.2) before x reaches 1.0, proceeding horizontally.
3. **Crossing Beyond the Length of Obstacle 2**: Shift rightward towards x = 5.0 while maintaining this safe y-value to avoid the extended presence of Obstacle 8 and 12.
4. **Approach the Lower Boundary of Goal Set**: Once past strategic obstacles, steer slightly upward to approach the goal from below.

### Constructed New Path:
By understanding these movements and the necessity to bypass obstacles, the following waypoints can ensure a valid path.

```python
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),    # Start inside the start set
    (0.5, 3.2),    # Move safely to a lower y-level below Obstacle 2
    (5.5, 3.2),    # Move rightwards key horizontal shift past Obstacle 2
    (6.3, 4.53),   # Near entrance to goal, adjusting y slightly to enter goal
    (6.5, 4.75)    # End inside the correct goal set
]
```

This path ensures a start in the correct region, avoids intersecting any given obstacles, and ends within the targeted goal area.

[08/22/2024 09:50:00 AM] To correct the path and avoid intersecting with the obstacles, let's carefully analyze the spatial layout of the obstacles and the start/goal areas.

### Analysis

1. **Start Area:** The path starts at (0.5, 3.5), which is within the defined start quadrilateral, so this point is valid.

2. **Current Invalid Segments:**
   - **Segment 2** from (0.5, 3.2) to (5.5, 3.2) crosses the following obstacles:
     - **Obstacle 8**: Positioned such that its bottom side lies along y = 3.0, so our path segment crosses this obstacle.
     - **Obstacle 10**: Positioned such that it extends vertically up to y = 4.0, so this segment will intersect it on the y-coordinate.
   - **Segment 3** from (5.5, 3.2) to (6.3, 4.53) intersects:
     - **Obstacle 12**: This obstacle covers from y = 2.0 to y = 5.0 vertically, and since our segment cuts through this y-axis range, it intersects.

3. **Avoidance Plan:** 
   - For the path to bypass the obstacle intersections, it requires strategic waypoint placement. For example:
     - Move from the start point (0.5, 3.5) horizontally till an obstacle-free vertical lane and skirt obstacles by adjusting y-coordinates or go diagonally if required.
     - Adjust the path via intermediate waypoints to shift the path around the problematic regions.

### Proposed New Path

Given the analysis, we can adjust the waypoints as follows:

1. Start from a valid start point within the start area, e.g., (0.5, 3.5).

2. Avoid intersecting with the obstacles by adding intermediate waypoints:
   - Move right but also slightly upward to dodge Obstacle 8 and Obstacle 10. Then use an upward diagonal to steer clear of Obstacle 12.

3. Given this, here is a proposed new path that circumvents the issues:

   ```
   new_path = [
       (0.5, 3.5),    # Start in the start set
       (1.5, 3.6),    # Bypass Obstacle 8 by slight elevation over it
       (5.0, 3.6),    # Steer right between the main obstacle line and the goal
       (5.5, 4.2),    # Diagonally ascent slightly to avoid Obstacle 12
       (6.3, 4.55)    # End within the goal area
   ]
   ```

### Conclusion

This revised path utilizes slight vertical and horizontal maneuvers to avoid intersecting the obstacles. By carefully navigating around Obstacle 8 and maintaining a safe clearance above Obstacle 10's vertical extension and Obstacle 12, the path strategically overlays the free space while creating a smooth transition towards the goal set.

[08/22/2024 09:50:09 AM] To design a new path that avoids the obstacles, it's essential to identify which segments are problematic and find alternative routes around any intersecting obstacles. Here is my analysis and proposed adjustments:

### Analysis

1. **Segment from (1.5, 3.6) to (5.0, 3.6):**
   - This segment crosses two obstacles: Obstacle 8 and Obstacle 10.
   - **Obstacle 8:** This obstacle spans from (2.9, 3.0) to (3.0, 4.0), so a segment directly at y = 3.6 will intersect its area.
   - **Obstacle 10:** Extends along y = 2.0 to 4.0, with a left boundary starting at x = 4.9. The segment at y = 3.6 going to x = 5.0 crosses this as well.

2. **Segment from (5.0, 3.6) to (5.5, 4.2):**
   - Obstacle 10's top extends horizontally along x = 4.9 to x = 5.0 at y = 4.0. Hence, moving directly to y = 4.2 crosses into this region.

3. **Segment from (5.5, 4.2) to (6.3, 4.55):**
   - Crosses Obstacle 12 just before reaching the goal set; its boundary starts at x = 5.9 up to x = 6.0.

### Adjustments

To effectively circumvent these obstacles while maintaining proximity to the start and goal set, I will propose a path that alters problematic segments:

1. Start at **(0.5, 3.5)** - Starts safely within the designated start quadrilateral.

2. Redirect the segment to **(2.8, 3.8)** - This waypoint is strategically placed to just clear above Obstacle 8.
   
3. Then move to **(4.6, 4.1)** - Move slightly diagonal upwards to avoid Obstacle 10 closer to its northern boundary.

4. From there, move to **(5.8, 4.3)** - This skips over the central interference of Obstacle 10.

5. Finally, conclude at **(6.3, 4.55)** - Successfully ending within the goal set, avoiding Obstacle 12 which starts at x = 5.9.

### New Proposed Path

By considering the problematic interactions and adjusting accordingly, the path looks as follows:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),  # Start point
    (2.8, 3.8),  # Step toward direction away from Obstacle 8
    (4.6, 4.1),  # Navigate diagonally upwards, skirting around Obstacle 10
    (5.8, 4.3),  # Bypassing Obstacle 10's obstruction
    (6.3, 4.55)  # End point within goal set, avoiding Obstacle 12
]
```

This new path ensures there is appropriate avoidance of the problematic intersections while providing a valid traversal from start to goal set.

[08/22/2024 09:50:18 AM] To develop a non-intersecting path from the start set to the goal set while avoiding obstacles, we need to carefully analyze the spatial arrangement of the obstacles and adjust the initial path accordingly.

### Analysis of the Problematic Segments:

1. **Segment 2 (between (2.8, 3.8) and (4.6, 4.1))**:
   - This segment intersects with Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 8.
   - Obstacle 2 is a long horizontal obstacle spanning from x=1.0 to x=5.0 at y=3.9 and y=4.0.
   - Obstacle 8 is a smaller obstacle spanning from x=2.9 to x=3.0 at y=3.0 to y=4.0.

   To bypass these obstacles, the path needs to detour above or below the y=3.9 line or to pass more to the right of Obstacle 8 and further above y=4.0.

2. **Segment 4 (between (5.8, 4.3) and (6.3, 4.55))**:
   - This segment intersects with Obstacle 12, which is a large vertical obstacle spanning from x=5.9 to x=6.0 and from y=2.0 to y=5.0.

   The path should be adjusted to either pass to the left at x=5.9 or above y=5.0 to navigate around this obstacle.

### New Path Proposal:

To avoid intersecting with obstacles and maintain a clear route from the start to the goal while keeping a reasonable distance from obstacles, the following adjusted path can be proposed:

1. **Start at** (0.5, 3.5), staying within the defined start area.
2. **First waypoint** at (2.8, 3.5) to move in a straight line to the right, ensuring clearance above Obstacle 8.
3. **Second waypoint** at (4.5, 4.2) to avoid Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 8 by moving slightly upwards and staying clear of Obstacle 12.
4. **Third waypoint** at (5.7, 4.0) to approach the goal while bypassing the left side of Obstacle 12.
5. **End at** (6.4, 4.75), safely within the goal set, maintaining separation from all obstacles.

With these waypoints, the path should navigate around obstacles without intersection while still starting and ending correctly.

### Resulting Path:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),     # Starting within the start set
    (2.8, 3.5),     # First waypoint, moving right and avoiding lower parts of obstacles
    (4.5, 4.2),     # Adjust upward to avoid Obstacle 2 and prepare to bypass Obstacle 12
    (5.7, 4.0),     # Maneuvering clear of Obstacle 12 on the left
    (6.4, 4.75)     # Ending within the goal set
]
```

This path should honor all constraints by avoiding obstacle intersections while navigating efficiently from the start to the goal set.

[08/22/2024 09:50:24 AM] ### Thought Process:

1. **Analyzing the Problematic Segments**:
   - **Segment 2** between points (2.8, 3.5) and (4.5, 4.2) intersects with obstacles 2 and 8. To avoid these collisions, the path must navigate around these obstacles either by going above or below them.
   - **Segment 4** between points (5.7, 4.0) and (6.4, 4.75) intersects with obstacle 12. This segment needs to steer clear of the vertical bounds of obstacle 12 and maneuver towards the goal set safely.

2. **Obstacle Avoidance Strategy**:
   - For **Segment 2**, consider an alternate route that steers clear of obstacle 8 by moving slightly north of its upper boundary, avoiding the upper bounds of obstacle 2.
   - For **Segment 4**, as obstacle 12 has a vertical span from 5.9 downwards, reroute the path to the left or closely to avoid its edge.

3. **Adjusting the Path**:
   - Add a waypoint between (2.8, 3.5) and (4.5, 4.2) to navigate this segment around obstacles 2 and 8. Moving slightly upward could exploit the vertical clearance available.
   - Introduce an additional waypoint in segment 4 to ensure clearing the right boundary of obstacle 12 safely.

### Revised Path:

- Start from a point within the start quadrilateral, say, (0.5, 3.5).
- Navigate slightly upward above obstacle 8, then approach a waypoint to clear obstacle 2.

Creating the new path with adjusted segments and additional waypoints:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),    # Start point within the start set 
    (2.8, 3.7),    # Move slightly upwards to avoid obstacle 8
    (3.7, 4.5),    # Navigate above obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.2),    # Maintain previous waypoint after clearing obstacles
    (5.8, 4.1),    # Move diagonally towards the goal set 
    (6.4, 4.75)    # End point within the goal set, avoiding obstacle 12
]
```

This revised path seeks to minimize intersection with obstacles by strategically relocating waypoints while ensuring the trajectory contiguously remains practical and does not intersect any obstacles.

[08/22/2024 09:50:34 AM] To revise the path and avoid intersecting obstacles, I'll analyze the problematic segments and suggest alternative routes.

**Analysis:**

1. **Segment 2: (2.8, 3.7) to (3.7, 4.5):**
   - The segment intersects with Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 8.
   - Obstacle 2 spans a wide horizontal area, and since the top boundary is at y = 4.0, we'd want to avoid crossing into this zone.
   - Obstacle 8 is in the vertical zone between x = 2.9 and x = 3.0, making the direct upward movement troublesome.

2. **Segment 5: (5.8, 4.1) to (6.4, 4.75):**
   - This segment intersects with Obstacle 12.
   - Obstacle 12 has a large vertical expanse covering from y = 2.0 to y = 5.0, and from x = 5.9 to x = 6.0.
   - We'll need to make sure we either go above the top of Obstacle 12 or reroute via a detour avoiding this range.

**Adjusted Path:**

We'll introduce some additional waypoints to adjust the path:

- **Start:** Remains unchanged, starting at (0.5, 3.5).

- **Segment Adjustment for (2.8, 3.7) to (3.7, 4.5):** 
  - To avoid the intersection with Obstacle 2 and 8, we can move right before going upwards.
  - New points after (2.8, 3.7) could be:
    - Move horizontally right to avoid close proximity to obstacle 8: (3.1, 3.7)
    - From here, move up to bypass above Obstacle 2's boundary: (3.1, 4.1)
    - Finally move to (3.7, 4.5)

- **Segment Adjustment for (5.8, 4.1) to (6.4, 4.75):**
  - To avoid the intersection with Obstacle 12, we can maneuver around it.
  - Move east just under the obstacle top: (5.8, 4.1) to (5.8, 4.6), moving outside the right edge of the obstacle.
  - Then go slightly above the top boundary, ensuring not to intersect with any vertical edge of Obstacle 12.

- **End:** Arrive appropriately within the goal set at (6.4, 4.75).

**New Path:**

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),     # Starting point in the start set
    (2.8, 3.7),     # Original next point before adjustments
    (3.1, 3.7),     # New waypoint to move horizontally right
    (3.1, 4.1),     # Elevate to bypass the horizontal constraint of obstacle
    (3.7, 4.5),     # Continue the planned ascent to next waypoint
    (4.5, 4.2),     # Move towards subsequent waypoint
    (5.8, 4.1),     # Moving towards the segment avoiding new obstacle
    (5.8, 4.6),     # Move slightly upwards before redirect here
    (6.4, 4.75)     # Enter the goal area properly
]
```

This new pathway adjusts segments experiencing interference, aiming to respect boundaries while navigating efficiently between the start and end positions.

Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/22/2024 09:50:44 AM] To generate a new path that avoids intersecting with the specified obstacles, let's carefully re-evaluate each segment of the original path and make adjustments as needed. Here's the thought process for each problematic segment, along with the necessary changes:

### Analysis and Correction

1. **Start Point**: The original start point is (0.5, 3.5), which is within the start set, so it remains valid.

2. **Segment 2 (between (2.8, 3.7) and (3.1, 3.7)) intersects with Obstacle 8**: The segment crosses over Obstacle 8. To correct this, we can reroute this segment to pass outside the obstacle.

3. **Segment 3 (between (3.1, 3.7) and (3.1, 4.1)) intersects with Obstacle 2**: This vertical movement passes through Obstacle 2. Since we need to go around, I'll adjust the waypoint to the left or right side of Obstacle 2.

4. **Segment 8 (between (5.8, 4.6) and (6.4, 4.75)) intersects with Obstacle 12**: The segment intersects with Obstacle 12. The path can be adjusted to move upwards sooner and pass above Obstacle 12 if space allows.

### Revised Path Proposal

Taking into consideration these adjustments, here is a new path proposal:

1. Start at a point in the start set: (0.5, 3.5).

2. Move to (2.8, 3.8) to safely navigate around Obstacle 8 by keeping a distance to the right of the obstacle.

3. Next, instead of going straight up which crosses Obstacle 2, move right to (3.5, 3.8) staying above the obstacle.

4. Move upwards to (3.5, 4.2) to safely bypass Obstacle 2 vertically.

5. Continue on to (4.5, 4.2), bypassing clogging areas and staying clear of Obstacle 10 by keeping from the left above certain thresholds.

6. Bypass around to (5.2, 4.2) to ensure clear passage linked with the right side clearance toward Obstacle 10.

7. Then proceed straight up to (5.8, 4.2) to bypass Obstacle 12.

8. Finally, continue to (6.4, 4.6) to safely approach the target without intersecting Obstacle 12.

9. End in the goal set at (6.4, 4.6).

### New Path

new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),
    (2.8, 3.8), 
    (3.5, 3.8), 
    (3.5, 4.2), 
    (4.5, 4.2), 
    (5.2, 4.2), 
    (5.8, 4.2), 
    (6.4, 4.6)
]

This path is expected to navigate through the start and goal sets while respecting the constraints of avoiding all specified obstacles.
