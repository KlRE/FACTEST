# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[0.0, 10.0], [-0.1, 10.0], [-0.1, -0.0], [0.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[10.1, 10.0], [10.0, 10.0], [10.0, -0.0], [10.1, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[10.0, 0.0], [-0.0, 0.0], [-0.0, -0.1], [10.0, -0.1]]
			Obstacle 4: [[10.0, 10.1], [-0.0, 10.1], [-0.0, 10.0], [10.0, 10.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/22/2024 08:49:14 AM] To determine a valid path from the start set to the goal set while avoiding the obstacles, we should consider their positioning and ensure the path does not cross any boundaries. Let's analyze the given data and construct a feasible path.

### Data Summary:
- **Start Position**: Quadrilateral with vertices at [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
- **Goal Position**: Quadrilateral with vertices at [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
- **Obstacles**: Four boundaries forming the edges of the coordinate space.

### Analysis:
1. **Start Point Selection**: We can choose a point within the start quadrilateral. For simplicity, let's choose the center point (1.75, 1.75).
2. **Goal Point Selection**: Similarly, for the goal, we can choose (9.0, 9.0), which is the center of the goal quadrilateral.
3. **Path Planning**: We need to move from (1.75, 1.75) to (9.0, 9.0). The main task is to maneuver through the quadrilateral constraints without intersecting them. The obstacles defined by the boundaries are slightly beyond the typical limits; hence, a careful mid-path point would help ensure non-crossing.

### Path Construction:
- Starting at mid-point within the start area (1.75, 1.75).
- Moving diagonally to avoid perimeter obstacles but staying inside notably above the obstacle boundaries, ensuring no crossing below y = 0.0 or x-axis boundaries.
- Intermediate point such as (5.0, 5.0) would provide a balanced waypoint maintaining an inner trajectory.
- Finally, finish at the mid-point within the goal area (9.0, 9.0).

### Proposed Path:
``` 
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start within the start quadrilateral
    (5.0, 5.0),    # Midway point to ensure a safe passage between peripheral boundaries
    (9.0, 9.0)     # End within the goal quadrilateral
]
```
This path maintains a safe distance from the obstacles defined by the outer boundaries and concludes within the designated goal area. It avoids crossing the obstacles by taking a central trajectory through the free space.
