# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[0.0, 10.0], [-0.1, 10.0], [-0.1, -0.0], [0.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[10.1, 10.0], [10.0, 10.0], [10.0, -0.0], [10.1, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[10.0, 0.0], [-0.0, 0.0], [-0.0, -0.1], [10.0, -0.1]]
			Obstacle 4: [[10.0, 10.1], [-0.0, 10.1], [-0.0, 10.0], [10.0, 10.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/22/2024 08:48:39 AM] To define a path that begins in the designated start area, concludes in the goal area, and avoids the described obstacles, we'll need to carefully choose waypoints that navigate the space without intersecting any of the boundaries of the obstacles.

### Analysis of the Environment

1. **Start and Goal Areas**: 
   - Start Quadrilateral: The area defined is a small square with vertices at [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]. We can choose a starting point roughly at the center for simplicity, such as (1.75, 1.75).
   - Goal Quadrilateral: This is also a square, with vertices [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]. A point near the center could be (9.0, 9.0).

2. **Obstacles**:
   - The obstacles essentially create a boundary around much of the perimeter of the space but leave the main area between them open. This simplifies our path planning somewhat, as we primarily need to ensure we don't intersect the thin lines these obstacles create on the edges.

### Path Planning Strategy

Given the start and goal are quite centrally located and the main field remains open between the perimeter-bound obstacles, our path will follow a simplistic, minimal waypoints strategy while staying clearly within bounds and avoiding the "walls" created by obstacles.

### Proposed Path

Let's define a straightforward path:

- Begin at a point within the starting area.
- Move diagonally upwards and rightwards through the open center of the space avoiding the surrounding borders.
- Arrive at a point within the goal area.

```python
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75), # Start within the start set
    (5.0, 5.0),   # Central point in the open area, away from obstacle boundaries
    (9.0, 9.0)    # End within the goal set
]
```

### Explanation

1. **(1.75, 1.75)**: Selected as a suitable starting point in the center of the start quadrilateral.
2. **(5.0, 5.0)**: This waypoint is strategically placed towards the center of the field, utilizing the open space available and keeping a safe distance from the perimeter obstacles.
3. **(9.0, 9.0)**: Selected as an endpoint roughly central to the goal region.

This path safeguards against intersecting any obstacles by sticking to a route through the large, unrestricted central area of the space.
