# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[0.0, 10.0], [-0.1, 10.0], [-0.1, -0.0], [0.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[10.1, 10.0], [10.0, 10.0], [10.0, -0.0], [10.1, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[10.0, 0.0], [-0.0, 0.0], [-0.0, -0.1], [10.0, -0.1]]
			Obstacle 4: [[10.0, 10.1], [-0.0, 10.1], [-0.0, 10.0], [10.0, 10.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/22/2024 08:49:31 AM] To plan a path from the given start position to the goal position while avoiding obstacles, let's first analyze the provided environment. 

### Provided Data Reanalysis
#### Start Position
The start set is a quadrilateral defined by these corners: 
- (2.0, 2.0)
- (1.5, 2.0)
- (1.5, 1.5)
- (2.0, 1.5)

You can choose any point within this region. For simplicity, let's choose the midpoint, (1.75, 1.75), as the starting point.

#### Goal Position
The goal set is defined by these corners:
- (9.5, 9.5)
- (8.5, 9.5)
- (8.5, 8.5)
- (9.5, 8.5)

Let's choose the midpoint (9.0, 9.0) as a feasible endpoint.

#### Obstacles
The given obstacles define outer boundary constraints:
1. Obstacle 1: Positioned adjacent to x = 0, covering the entire y-range.
2. Obstacle 2: Positioned near x = 10, parallel to the first, covering the entire y-range.
3. Obstacle 3: Positioned adjacent to y = 0, covering the entire x-range.
4. Obstacle 4: Positioned near y = 10, parallel to the third, covering the entire x-range.

### Path Planning

Based on the obstacle placements, the path can navigate freely within (0, 0) to (10, 10), excluding touching or crossing these boundary lines. 

### Suggested Path
We'll create a simple path that travels in a straight, minimally avoiding manner:

1. Start at (1.75, 1.75) inside the start set.
2. Move directly towards the goal while ensuring the path stays well within the boundary set by obstacles.

new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75), # Starting point within the start set
    (5.0, 5.0),   # Move towards the center of potential space
    (9.0, 9.0)    # End point within the goal set
]

This proposed path avoids crossing the boundaries defined by the obstacles and starts/ends within the defined start and goal regions. Remember, this is a conceptual path and would need verifying under real-world conditions or simulations.
