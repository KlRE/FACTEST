# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[0.0, 10.0], [-0.1, 10.0], [-0.1, -0.0], [0.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[10.1, 10.0], [10.0, 10.0], [10.0, -0.0], [10.1, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[10.0, 0.0], [-0.0, 0.0], [-0.0, -0.1], [10.0, -0.1]]
			Obstacle 4: [[10.0, 10.1], [-0.0, 10.1], [-0.0, 10.0], [10.0, 10.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/22/2024 08:48:32 AM] To determine a path from the defined start area to the goal area while avoiding specified obstacles, we need to analyze the available space and position the waypoints accordingly. The key is to ensure that no segments of the path intersect with any of the obstacles or touch them by maintaining a safe distance.

### Analysis:
- **Start Area:** The 4 vertices are [(2.0, 2.0), (1.5, 2.0), (1.5, 1.5), (2.0, 1.5)]. We can choose, for example, (1.75, 1.75) as a starting point which is centrally located within this area.
- **Goal Area:** The 4 vertices are [(9.5, 9.5), (8.5, 9.5), (8.5, 8.5), (9.5, 8.5)]. Choosing a point like (9.0, 9.0) within the goal set works well and is centrally located.
- **Obstacles:** 
  - Obstacle 1, 2, 3, and 4 form boundaries or walls surrounding the grid, confining us within the inner coordinates from 0.0 to 10.0.
  - This essentially leaves a clear path along the middle of the grid.

### Waypoints:
1. **Start Point:** (1.75, 1.75) — Chosen within the start quadrilateral.
2. **Transitioning Points:** One potential strategy is to navigate through the middle of the grid, avoiding the densely packed spaces near the edges potentially blocked by the boundary-forming obstacles.
3. **Goal Point:** (9.0, 9.0) — Within the goal quadrilateral.

### Path Construction:
The path can logically follow a diagonal moving centrally across the unoccupied area. For instance:

- Start at (1.75, 1.75)
- Move to an intermediate central waypoint. Assume our midpoint is chosen as (5.0, 5.0)
- Finally, reach the goal at (9.0, 9.0)

This subset of waypoints ensures smooth transitions while maintaining an adequate distance from all outlined obstacles.

### Proposed Path:
```python
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75), # Start within start area
    (5.0, 5.0),   # Intermediate waypoint in clear space avoiding obstacles
    (9.0, 9.0)    # End within goal area
]
```

This approach utilizes a straightforward path that does not risk touching or crossing any obstacles, effectively navigating from the start to the goal region.
