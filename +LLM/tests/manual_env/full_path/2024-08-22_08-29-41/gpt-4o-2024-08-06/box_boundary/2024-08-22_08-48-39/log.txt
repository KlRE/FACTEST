# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[0.0, 10.0], [-0.1, 10.0], [-0.1, -0.0], [0.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[10.1, 10.0], [10.0, 10.0], [10.0, -0.0], [10.1, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[10.0, 0.0], [-0.0, 0.0], [-0.0, -0.1], [10.0, -0.1]]
			Obstacle 4: [[10.0, 10.1], [-0.0, 10.1], [-0.0, 10.0], [10.0, 10.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/22/2024 08:48:44 AM] To create a path from the start set to the goal set while avoiding obstacles, we need to understand the spatial arrangement of the start, goal, and obstacles. The given coordinates describe vertical obstacles on the far left and right (Obstacles 1 and 2), and horizontal obstacles on the far bottom and top (Obstacles 3 and 4), creating a bounded movement area from (0, 0) to (10, 10).

### Start and Goal Position Analysis
- **Start Quadrilateral**: Within [x, y] coordinates in the small region between (1.5, 1.5) and (2.0, 2.0).
- **Goal Quadrilateral**: Within [x, y] coordinates in the region between (8.5, 8.5) and (9.5, 9.5).

### Obstacles Analysis
- **Obstacle 1 and 2**: Creating a vertical boundary on the left and right at x ≈ 0 and x ≈ 10; however, minimal in width should already be not encroached by practical path planning.
- **Obstacle 3 and 4**: Creating a horizontal layer on the bottom at y ≈ 0 and on the top at y ≈ 10.

### Path Planning
Given that the obstacles serve as walls creating boundaries rather than scattered obstacles, the optimal path is almost straight given our lack of sectional obstructions:

**Potential Path Plan**:
1. **Start Point**: Choose a point within the start set.
2. **Waypoints**: Maintain an efficient straight path from the start to the goal region, optionally adjusting midpoints to account for obstacle proximity limit.
3. **End Point**: Choose a point within the goal set.

Here's a reasonable sequence of waypoints:

```plaintext
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Midpoint within the start quadrilateral
    (5.0, 5.0),    # Approximate midpoint of the accessible space leading towards the goal
    (9.0, 9.0)     # Midpoint within the goal quadrilateral
]
```

This path provides a relatively direct line from start to goal while naturally avoiding the walls represented by obstacles. You should ensure all line segments stay clear of the obstacle boundaries by maintaining a minimal buffer zone around the quadrilateral constraints.
