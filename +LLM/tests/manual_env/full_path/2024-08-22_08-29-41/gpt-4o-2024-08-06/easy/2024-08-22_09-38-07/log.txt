# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/22/2024 09:38:14 AM] To create a path that begins within the start quadrilateral, ends within the goal quadrilateral, and avoids the specified obstacles, we'll first assess the positions of these features.

### Starting Position
- **Quadrilateral Vertices:** [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
- **Chosen Start Point:** (0.5, 0.5) — a simple point within the start area.

### Goal Position
- **Quadrilateral Vertices:** [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
- **Chosen End Point:** (4.5, 4.5) — a straightforward point within the goal area.

### Obstacles
- **Obstacle 1:** [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0]]
- **Obstacle 2:** [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]

### Path Planning
Given the positions of the start area, goal area, and obstacles, a feasible path can be constructed through points that move from the start area, around the obstacles, and toward the goal area without intersecting any obstacle boundaries.

1. **Start at (0.5, 0.5)**
2. **Move to (1.5, 1.5)** to avoid Obstacle 1
3. **Move to (3.5, 1.5)**, staying above the bottom of Obstacle 1
4. **Move to (3.5, 2.5)**, rising above the top of Obstacle 1
5. **Move to (3.5, 3.5)** to navigate alongside the open space
6. **Move to (4.5, 4.5)**, entering the goal area

These waypoints provide a simple straight-line path and maintain a safe distance from obstacles. This path is designed to adhere to the non-crossing rule and ends within the goal quadrilateral.

### Output Path
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (1.5, 1.5),
    (3.5, 1.5),
    (3.5, 2.5),
    (3.5, 3.5),
    (4.5, 4.5)
]
```

This path starts in the designated start area, avoids crossing any obstacles, and ends in the designated goal area.
