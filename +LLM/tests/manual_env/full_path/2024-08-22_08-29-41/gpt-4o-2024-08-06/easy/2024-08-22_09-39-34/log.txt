# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/22/2024 09:39:41 AM] To design a suitable path in the given environment, we need to ensure our path starts within the start position, ends within the goal position, and avoids intersecting or touching the defined obstacles. Let's analyze the setup:

### Provided Data
- **Start Position (Quadrilateral):** [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
- **Goal Position (Quadrilateral):** [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
- **Obstacles:**
  - **Obstacle 1:** [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0]]
  - **Obstacle 2:** [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]

### Analysis
1. **Start Position:** We can select a starting point within the square bounded by (0.0, 0.0) and (1.0, 1.0). Let's choose (0.5, 0.5).
2. **Goal Position:** A suitable endpoint within the goal set is (4.5, 4.5).
3. **Path Planning Considerations:**
   - **Obstacle 1** spans from x = 2.0 to x = 4.0 and from y = 0.0 to y = 1.0. We must navigate around this vertically as it blocks direct horizontal movement.
   - **Obstacle 2** covers a large area from x = -2.0 to x = 3.0 and y = 2.0 to y = 4.0. Since it reaches up to the boundary of the goal set at y = 4.0, we can navigate above or around it.

### Path Proposal
To find a path that avoids the obstacles, we can create a route that first moves upwards away from the start position, then navigates horizontally and vertically around the obstacles to reach the goal position:

- Start at (0.5, 0.5) - a point inside the start set.
- Move vertically upward to (0.5, 1.5) to avoid Obstacle 1.
- Continue moving right to (4.5, 1.5) - keeping a safe distance from the top of Obstacle 1.
- Finally, move upward to reach (4.5, 4.5) inside the goal set.

### Path Format
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start within the start position 
    (0.5, 1.5),   # Move up to have clearance over Obstacle 1
    (4.5, 1.5),   # Move right to the level beneath Obstacle 2 and above Obstacle 1
    (4.5, 4.5)    # Move up to finish within the goal position
]
```

This proposed path begins and ends within the respective start and goal areas while ensuring no part of the path intersects with any obstacles. The waypoints provide a simple yet effective linear path that achieves the task's objectives.
