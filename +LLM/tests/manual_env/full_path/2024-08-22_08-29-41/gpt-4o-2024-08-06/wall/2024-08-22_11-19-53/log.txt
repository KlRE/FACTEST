# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.0, 1.0], [8.0, 1.0], [8.0, -0.0], [9.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/22/2024 11:20:01 AM] To create a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids the given obstacles, we need to carefully choose waypoints that navigate around the obstacle. Here's a breakdown of the spatial configuration and the path planning:

### Provided Data
- **Start Position (Quadrilateral):** Defined by the vertices `[[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]`
- **Goal Position (Quadrilateral):** Defined by the vertices `[[9.0, 1.0], [8.0, 1.0], [8.0, 0.0], [9.0, 0.0]]`
- **Obstacle 1:** Defined by the vertices `[[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]`

### Strategy
The obstacle is positioned such that it overlaps with the y-axis range of the start and goal quadrilaterals. However, there is space to navigate around the upper side of the obstacle (the y-coordinates are below 4). Thus, choosing a path that stays above the y-boundaries of the obstacle (y > 4) can ensure clearance.

### Path Planning
1. **Starting Point:** Choose a point within the start set, e.g., `(0.5, 0.5)`.
2. **Navigate Upwards:** Move to a position above the obstacle, safely clearing its top boundary. For example, since the top boundary of the obstacle is at `y = 4`, we can choose `y = 4.5`.
3. **Move Right:** Navigate horizontally to the right, ensuring to keep above the obstacle.
4. **Descending to Goal:** End at a position within the goal set, ensuring the path does not touch the obstacle.

### Proposed Path
```plaintext
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 4.5),    # Move upwards to y = 4.5 to safely clear the obstacle's top
    (8.5, 4.5),    # Move right, staying above the obstacle
    (8.5, 0.5)     # Descend into the goal set
]
```
This path starts within the start quadrilateral, avoids the obstacle by moving above it, and ends within the goal quadrilateral. It ensures no waypoint intersects or touches the obstacle.
