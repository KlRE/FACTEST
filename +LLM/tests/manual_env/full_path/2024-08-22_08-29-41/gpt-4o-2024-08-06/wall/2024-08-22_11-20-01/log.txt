# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.0, 1.0], [8.0, 1.0], [8.0, -0.0], [9.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/22/2024 11:20:08 AM] To create a path that meets the given requirements, we first need to analyze the environment, ensuring that our path starts in the provided start position, ends in the goal position, and avoids the obstacle.

### Analysis of the Environment:

1. **Start Position**: The start quadrilateral is defined by the vertices [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]. The start point can be any point within this region. To simplify, let's choose the center of this quadrilateral, (0.5, 0.5).

2. **Goal Position**: The goal quadrilateral is defined by the vertices [[9.0, 1.0], [8.0, 1.0], [8.0, 0.0], [9.0, 0.0]]. Similarly, letâ€™s select the center point of this quadrilateral, (8.5, 0.5).

3. **Obstacle**: The obstacle is defined by the vertices [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]. This obstacle extends vertically from y = -4 to y = 4 and horizontally from x = 2 to x = 7.

### Path Planning:

- Since the obstacle stretches from x = 2 to x = 7 vertically, any path from start to goal must navigate around this obstacle. We need to either go above it or below it. Given the bounds, it seems reasonable to pass below the obstacle.

- Let's assume we take a path starting from our chosen point within the start quadrilateral, head downwards to avoid the obstacle, navigate horizontally past the obstacle, and then move upwards towards the goal.

Here is the resultant path:

```python
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start in the start set
    (1.0, -4.5), # Move downwards, clearly staying below the obstacle
    (8.0, -4.5), # Move horizontally, staying clear of the obstacle
    (8.5, 0.5)   # Move upwards to the center of the goal area
]
```

### Explanation:

- **(0.5, 0.5) to (1.0, -4.5)**: We move downwards to ensure we are beneath the obstacle's lowest y-bound (at -4.0), giving a buffer of 0.5 units for safety.

- **(1.0, -4.5) to (8.0, -4.5)**: We move horizontally across to the right, ensuring we stay beneath the obstacle throughout the path.

- **(8.0, -4.5) to (8.5, 0.5)**: We finally move upward into the goal region, reaching towards the middle.

This path respects the instructions by starting and ending in the respective quadrilaterals, and it avoids the obstacle by providing a safe margin.
