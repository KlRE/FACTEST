# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.0, 1.0], [8.0, 1.0], [8.0, -0.0], [9.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/22/2024 11:18:24 AM] To create a safe path from the start set to the goal set while avoiding the obstacle, let's analyze the given parameters and plan a course that does not intersect the obstacle.

### Analyzing the Situation:
1. **Start Set**: The quadrilateral defined by the points [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]] allows us to choose any point within it. For simplicity, a central starting point like (0.5, 0.5) will be chosen.
   
2. **Goal Set**: The quadrilateral defined by the points [[9.0, 1.0], [8.0, 1.0], [8.0, 0.0], [9.0, 0.0]] allows any point within it. A central goal point like (8.5, 0.5) will provide a good target.

3. **Obstacle**: The quadrilateral obstacle defined by [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]] can be visualized as a slanting trapezoidal area. The path must avoid crossing this region.

### Path Planning:
To avoid the obstacle while heading to the north of it, the path can be routed around the obstacle by heading north initially and then moving towards west before reaching the goal area. Hereâ€™s a proposed path:

```plaintext
1. Start from the middle of the start region: (0.5, 0.5)
2. Move north and outside the obstacle's boundary to avoid intersection: (0.5, 4.5)
3. Head directly in a straight line parallel to the x-axis and clear from the obstacle: (8.5, 4.5)
4. Move south to the middle of the goal region: (8.5, 0.5)
```

### New Path:
```python
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 4.5),  # Move above the obstacle
    (8.5, 4.5),  # Move horizontally towards above the goal
    (8.5, 0.5)   # Move down into the goal set
]
```

This path ensures that no direct line connecting the waypoints intersects with the obstacle, and the path maintains a safe distance by bypassing the obstacle to the north side.
