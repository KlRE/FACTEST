# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

[08/22/2024 09:59:34 AM] The original path crosses obstacle 2 multiple times. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle. 

1. **Starting Point:** Keep the starting point at (0.5, 0.5).

2. **Navigating Obstacle 2:**
    - Obstacle 2 extends upwards to y=6 and has a vertex at (5.0, 1.0).
    - To go around it, we can first move to a point with x > 5.0 and y > 6.0. 
    - Let's add a waypoint at (5.5, 6.5). 

3. **Reaching the Goal:**
    - From (5.5, 6.5), we can move directly to the goal set.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  
    (5.5, 6.5), 
    (4.5, 4.5)

[08/22/2024 09:59:40 AM] The original path crosses obstacle 2 because it attempts to go almost directly from start to goal. To avoid this, we need to route the path around the obstacle.

Here's a possible strategy and thought process:

1. **Initial Path:** We start at the center of the start set (0.5, 0.5).

2. **Navigating Obstacle 2:** We need to go above or below obstacle 2. Since the goal is above, let's aim to go above. We can go to a point like (0.5, 6.0), which is clearly above the obstacle.

3. **Approaching the Goal:** From (0.5, 6.0), we have a clear path to the center of the goal set (4.5, 4.5).

Therefore, the new path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start point
    (0.5, 6.0),  # Go above obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)   # Reach the goal

[08/22/2024 10:00:21 AM] The original path attempts to navigate around Obstacle 2 by going far to the left. However, the chosen path segments intersect with the obstacle. 

To correct the path, we can observe that there is a clear path above Obstacle 2. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 7.0),    # Move upwards above all obstacles 
    (4.5, 7.0),    # Move rightwards, staying above obstacles
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Move downwards to reach the goal set 
]
```

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Identify Problem:** The feedback indicated that the original path segments crossed Obstacle 2. 
2. **Analyze Environment:** Observing the obstacle coordinates, it's clear there's open space above Obstacle 2.
3. **Plan New Route:**
   - Move vertically upwards to a point safely above Obstacle 2.
   - Move horizontally towards the goal, staying above the obstacle.
   - Finally, move downwards to enter the goal set.
4. **Define Waypoints:** The `new_path` represents this adjusted route with waypoints that ensure obstacle avoidance.

[08/22/2024 10:00:28 AM] The current path attempts to go above obstacle 2, but in doing so intersects it. It's necessary to route the path around obstacle 2 entirely.  

One approach could be:

1. **Start:** Keep the starting point at (0.5, 0.5).
2. **Navigate Right:** Move directly right to  (3.5, 0.5), staying below obstacle 1.
3. **Move Up:**  Go up to (3.5, 7.0), clearing obstacle 2.
4. **Head Left:** Move left to reach (4.5, 7.0), staying above obstacle 2. 
5. **Reach the Goal:** Finally, go down to (4.5, 4.5) to end within the goal set.

This strategy avoids both obstacles by going around obstacle 1 on the bottom and obstacle 2 on the top.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),

[08/22/2024 10:00:36 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate directly to the goal set but intersects with Obstacle 2. To rectify this, the path needs to be adjusted to go around this obstacle. 

Here's a possible approach and the thought process:

1. **Starting Point:** The initial starting point (0.5, 0.5) is acceptable as it lies within the start set.

2. **Navigating Obstacle 2:**  Obstacle 2 presents a challenge as it stretches across a significant portion of the path. 

   * **Option 1: Going Above:** One option is to route the path above Obstacle 2. This involves moving significantly upwards before navigating towards the goal set.

   * **Option 2: Going Below:** Another option is to navigate below Obstacle 2. This might require maneuvering around Obstacle 1 as well.

3. **Choosing the Optimal Option:** Considering the position of the goal set and the obstacles, navigating above Obstacle 2 (Option 1) seems more efficient. It allows for a more direct path with potentially fewer waypoints.

4. **Proposed Path:** Based on the above analysis, a possible path could be:

   ```
   new_path = [
       (0.5, 0.5),     // Start Point
       (0.5, 7.0),     // Move upwards to clear Obstacle 2 
       (4.5, 7.0),     // Move rightwards towards the goal set 
       (4.5, 4.5)      // Move down into the goal set
   ]
   ```

5. **Verification:** This new path starts within the start set, avoids crossing any obstacles, and ends within the goal set.

    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:00:42 AM] The original path's segment from (0.5, 0.5) to (0.5, 7.0) crosses Obstacle 2. To avoid this, we can route the path around the left side of Obstacle 2.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start within the start set
    (-2.5, 0.5),   # Move left to clear Obstacle 2
    (-2.5, 7.0),  # Move upward, staying clear of Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 7.0),  # Move rightward, above all obstacles
    (4.5, 4.5)   # Move down into the goal set
]
```

This path first moves left to ensure it's clear of Obstacle 2, then proceeds upward to a point above all obstacles. Finally, it moves rightward and downward to reach the goal set. This avoids any intersections with the obstacles. 

[08/22/2024 10:00:42 AM] Parsed response: [(0.5, 0.5), (-2.5, 0.5), (-2.5, 7.0), (4.5, 7.0), (4.5, 4.5)]
[08/22/2024 10:00:42 AM] Starts in init: True, Ends in goal: True
[08/22/2024 10:00:42 AM] Path is successful
