# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:51:36 AM] A viable path could travel above obstacle 2, taking advantage of the open space in the upper portion of the defined area.

Here's a possible waypoint path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start within the start set.
    (0.5, 6.0),   # Move upwards, clearing obstacle 2.
    (5.5, 6.0),   # Move rightwards, staying clear of obstacles.
    (4.5, 4.5)    # Move down into the goal set.
] 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(0.5, 0.5):**  Starts within the safe starting zone.
2. **(0.5, 6.0):** Moves directly upwards to a point safely above both obstacles.
3. **(5.5, 6.0):**  Moves rightwards to a position horizontally aligned with the goal zone, still safely above obstacles.
4. **(4.5, 4.5):**  Moves directly downwards into the center of the goal zone.

This path avoids crossing any obstacles while successfully reaching the goal from the start.

			Obstacle 2: [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]]

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:51:45 AM] The original path intersects with Obstacle 2 because it attempts to go above the obstacle in a straight line. To avoid this, we can adjust the path to go around the obstacle to the right. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start within the start set.
    (3.0, 0.5),   # Move to the right, staying below Obstacle 2.
    (3.0, 7.0),   # Move upwards, clearing Obstacle 2.
    (5.5, 7.0),   # Move right, surpassing Obstacle 2.
    (4.5, 4.5)    # Move diagonally down into the goal set.
]
```

Here's the breakdown:

1. **(0.5, 0.5) to (3.0, 0.5):**  Move horizontally to the right, staying below the y-coordinate of Obstacle 2. 
2. **(3.0, 0.5) to (3.0, 7.0):**  Move vertically upwards, clearing the highest point of Obstacle 2.
3. **(3.0, 7.0) to (5.5, 7.0):** Move horizontally to the right, surpassing Obstacle 2 completely.
4. **(5.5, 7.0) to (4.5, 4.5):** Move diagonally down towards the goal set. 

This path ensures a safe distance from Obstacle 2 while navigating from the start to the goal.

[08/22/2024 09:51:53 AM] The original path attempts to cross obstacle 2 directly.  The path needs adjustments to navigate around this obstacle.

1. **Initial Segment:** Starting at (0.5, 0.5) is fine. To avoid obstacle 2, we should aim to go above it. 

2. **Navigating Upwards:** Let's pick a point directly above the obstacle at (0.5, 7.0). This avoids both obstacles.

3. **Heading Towards the Goal:**  From (0.5, 7.0), we can move horizontally towards the goal, reaching a point like (5.5, 7.0). 

4. **Final Descent:** The final step is to move down into the goal area. The point (4.5, 4.5) is a suitable endpoint.

**Therefore, the revised path is:**

```

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:52:05 AM] The original path attempts to move rightwards at a y-value of 0.5, but Obstacle 2 extends significantly below this y-value, making a direct approach impossible. To avoid this, the path needs to move upwards before moving rightwards. We also have to make sure that the upward movement doesn't intersect with Obstacle 2. We can achieve this by moving the path to the left. Then, the path can proceed rightwards above Obstacle 2 before reaching the goal. 

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set.
    (-1.0, 0.5),   # Move left to avoid Obstacle 2's protrusion.
    (-1.0, 3.0),   # Move upwards to a point clearly above Obstacle 2.

[08/22/2024 09:52:16 AM] The original path attempts to navigate around Obstacle 2 from the left, which leads to collisions. A better strategy would be to navigate above Obstacle 2, ensuring a safe distance to avoid intersection. 

The chosen start point (0.5, 0.5) is fine. 

To avoid Obstacle 2, we can route the path above its highest point. The highest y-coordinate of Obstacle 2 is 6.0. Therefore, we can direct the path to a point with a y-coordinate greater than 6.0.

From there, we can proceed horizontally towards the goal position.  Therefore, we introduce an intermediate waypoint at (6.0, 6.5).

Finally, we can move down to the desired endpoint within the goal set. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   
    (0.5, 6.5),   
    (6.0, 6.5),

]

[08/22/2024 09:52:24 AM] The initial path intersects with Obstacle 2 because it attempts to go above the obstacle in a straight line. However, Obstacle 2 has a vertex that extends upwards, causing the intersection.

To correct this, we can adjust the path to go around Obstacle 2 by routing it between Obstacles 1 and 2. 

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start inside the start set
    (3.0, 0.5),    # Move right, staying below Obstacle 2 
    (3.0, 3.5),    # Move upwards, staying to the left of Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 3.5),    # Move right, clearing Obstacle 2 
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Move upwards to end inside the goal set
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **(0.5, 0.5) -> (3.0, 0.5):**  Move horizontally to the right, staying below all obstacles.
2. **(3.0, 0.5) -> (3.0, 3.5):** Move vertically upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 2's lower-left vertex. 
3. **(3.0, 3.5) -> (4.5, 3.5):** Move horizontally to the right, clearing the rightmost point of Obstacle 2. 
4. **(4.5, 3.5) -> (4.5, 4.5):**  Move vertically upwards to reach the goal set. 
 
This adjusted path avoids all obstacles while successfully connecting the start and goal sets.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:52:31 AM] The initial path attempts to move rightwards and then upwards. However, Obstacle 2 protrudes downwards significantly, blocking the direct path to the goal. To circumvent this, the path needs to first move upwards, clear of Obstacle 2, then proceed rightwards towards the goal.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set.
    (0.5, 3.0),    # Move upwards, clear of the x-range of Obstacle 2.
    (3.0, 3.0),    # Move rightwards, aligning with the goal's x-coordinate.
    (3.0, 4.5),    # Move upwards, entering the goal set.
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Move rightwards, reaching the final destination within the goal set. 
]
```

This revised path avoids both obstacles:

* **Segment 1 & 2:** Moves vertically upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 2's protruding section. 
* **Segment 3:** Moves rightwards in the clear space between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2.
* **Segment 4 & 5:**  Safely navigates to the final destination within the goal set.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.

    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:52:39 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate directly to the goal but encounters Obstacle 2. To circumvent this, a new strategy is required.

1. **Initial Movement:** Starting at (0.5, 0.5), a safe initial movement is to head upwards, avoiding any immediate collision with Obstacle 2. A suitable waypoint for this could be (0.5, 2.0).

2. **Navigating Around Obstacle 2:**  Obstacle 2 extends upwards significantly, while remaining relatively thin horizontally. Therefore, moving to the right and aiming for the space between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 1 seems like a viable option.  A waypoint like (3.5, 2.0) could be chosen.

3. **Approaching the Goal:**  With Obstacle 2 successfully bypassed, the path can now head upwards towards the goal region. Choosing a waypoint like (3.5, 4.5) positions the path for a final approach. 

4. **Reaching the Goal:**  The final step is a simple movement to the right, entering the goal set. The goal point (4.5, 4.5) serves this purpose well.

Therefore, a revised path considering the obstacle positions is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 2.0), 
    (3.5, 2.0), 
    (3.5, 4.5),

[08/22/2024 09:52:54 AM] The initial path attempts to go around the obstacles by taking a route above and to the right. However, the segment connecting the first two waypoints intersects with Obstacle 2. 

To correct this, we need to find a path that navigates around Obstacle 2 while still aiming for the goal. 

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Start Point:** Keep the starting point (0.5, 0.5).
2. **Navigate Below Obstacle 2:** Instead of going above, let's try going below Obstacle 2. A waypoint around (2.5, -1.5) would place us below both obstacles.
3. **Approach Goal:** From this position, we can move towards the goal.  A waypoint around (5.5, -1.5) gets us horizontally aligned with the goal set.
4. **Reach Goal:** Finally, move upwards to enter the goal set. The endpoint (4.5, 4.5) remains valid.

Therefore, a revised path could be:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    
    (2.5, -1.5),   
    (5.5, -1.5),   
    (4.5, 4.5)
]
```

This proposed path needs to be visually verified or checked with a more robust collision detection method to guarantee it doesn't intersect the obstacles.

[08/22/2024 09:53:16 AM] The initial path went too far south, leading to collisions with Obstacle 1.  The path needs to navigate around the obstacles to reach the goal.

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Start:** Keep the starting point (0.5, 0.5) as it lies within the start set. 
2. **Navigate Upwards:** Move directly upwards to a y-coordinate that's above both obstacles. For example, (0.5, 7.0) would be safe.
3. **Navigate Rightwards:**  Move horizontally towards the goal set until reaching an x-coordinate greater than the obstacles, such as (6.0, 7.0). 
4. **Navigate Downwards:** Move downwards towards the goal set, aiming for a point within its boundaries, like (4.5, 4.5).

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 7.0),

[08/22/2024 09:53:22 AM] The primary issue with the initial path was the intersection of the first segment with Obstacle 2. To address this, we need a path that goes around this obstacle.

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Start Point:** We can keep the initial starting point (0.5, 0.5).
2. **Navigate around Obstacle 2:** Instead of going straight up, we can first move to the right, avoiding Obstacle 2 completely. A safe waypoint could be (3.0, 0.5). 
3. **Ascend to Goal Level:** From this point, we can safely move upwards to a point above the obstacles and on level with the goal, such as (3.0, 6.0).
4. **Reach the Goal:** Finally, we move horizontally to the left towards the goal set. A suitable end point within the goal set would be (4.5, 4.5).

Therefore, the adjusted path looks like this:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  
    (3.0, 0.5), 
    (3.0, 6.0), 
    (4.5, 4.5)

[08/22/2024 09:53:29 AM] The initial path segments intersect with Obstacle 2 because it cuts across the space between the start and goal. To correct this, the path needs to navigate around Obstacle 2. 

1. **Starting Point:** The initial starting point (0.5, 0.5) is good as it's already positioned to maneuver around Obstacle 2.

2. **Navigating Upwards:** Instead of moving horizontally first, let's move upwards to a y-coordinate greater than the highest point of Obstacle 2 (y=6.0). A suitable waypoint could be (0.5, 6.5).

3. **Navigating Rightwards:** Now we can move horizontally to the right, clearing Obstacle 2. A good waypoint here could be (6.5, 6.5), ensuring we're well clear of the obstacle.

4. **Descending to the Goal:** Finally, we can descend to the goal area. We can go directly to the center of the goal position with the waypoint (4.5, 4.5).

Therefore, the updated path is: 

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  
    (0.5, 6.5),

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:53:42 AM] The original path attempts to go around the obstacles by moving below them. However, both segments of this maneuver intersect with obstacle 1. The path needs to be adjusted to navigate above obstacle 1 and between obstacles 1 and 2.

Here is a possible approach:

1. **Start Point:** Keep the original starting point (0.5, 0.5).
2. **Navigate Above Obstacle 1:** Move vertically upwards to a point above obstacle 1, for example, (0.5, 2.5). 
3. **Navigate Between Obstacles:** Move horizontally towards the goal, passing through the gap between obstacles 1 and 2. A suitable waypoint could be (3.5, 2.5).
4. **Reach Goal:**  Finally, move downwards to reach the goal area. The end point could be (4.5, 4.5), as in the original path.

Therefore, the corrected path is:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 2.5), (3.5, 2.5), (4.5, 4.5)] 
```

[08/22/2024 09:53:49 AM] The original path crosses obstacle 2 multiple times. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle. 

1. **Starting Point:** Keep the starting point at (0.5, 0.5).

2. **Navigating Obstacle 2:** Obstacle 2 extends upwards significantly and has a complex shape. To simplify the path, it's better to navigate around it by going below its lowest point.

3. **Waypoint 1:** Move downwards to (0.5, -1.0). This puts the path well below Obstacle 2.

4. **Waypoint 2:** Move rightwards, staying clear of Obstacle 1, to a point right of Obstacle 2: (6.0, -1.0).

5. **Waypoint 3:** Move upwards, again avoiding Obstacle 1, to (6.0, 4.5).

6. **Goal Point:**  Finally, move leftwards to reach the goal set at (4.5, 4.5).

[08/22/2024 09:54:21 AM] The original path's segments 2 and 3 collide with Obstacle 1. To circumvent this, the path needs adjustments:

1. **Initial Maneuvering:** Starting at (0.5, 0.5), a clear path exists to move downward, avoiding any immediate obstacle interference.

2. **Circumventing Obstacle 1:** To completely bypass Obstacle 1, the path should extend far enough in the negative y-direction to avoid any intersection with the obstacle's extended boundaries. A safe waypoint could be (0.5, -3.0).

3. **Vertical Alignment with Goal:** From (0.5, -3.0), a straight vertical path to (0.5, 4.5) aligns with the goal position without intersecting any obstacles.

4. **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, a horizontal movement from (0.5, 4.5) directly reaches the goal position at (4.5, 4.5).

Therefore, the adjusted path is as follows:

```
new_path = [

    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:54:27 AM] The original path attempts to navigate around Obstacle 2 by going underneath it. However, this approach fails as it creates intersections with the obstacle. 

To correct this, the path should instead navigate above Obstacle 2.

Here's a possible corrected path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 7.0),   # Move upwards to a point clearly above Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 7.0),   # Move rightwards to align with the goal set 
    (4.5, 4.5)    # Move downwards to end within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Vertical Movement:** The path now first moves significantly upwards (y = 7.0) to a point that is clearly above the highest point of Obstacle 2. 
2. **Horizontal Movement:** From this elevated position, the path moves horizontally towards the goal set. 
3. **Final Descent:** Finally, the path moves downwards to reach the desired endpoint within the goal set.

This adjusted path avoids any intersections with obstacles, ensuring a safe and valid path.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:54:35 AM] The initial path's segment from (0.5, 0.5) to (0.5, 7.0) cuts right through Obstacle 2. To avoid this, we need to route the path around this obstacle.

Looking at the obstacle layout, we can observe:

* **Clearance above Obstacle 2:**  Obstacle 2 doesn't extend too far upwards (its highest y-coordinate is 6.0).

Therefore, we can adjust the path as follows:

1. **Start:** Keep the starting point at (0.5, 0.5).
2. **Navigate above Obstacle 2:**  Instead of going straight up, move upward to a point with a y-coordinate greater than 6.0 (Obstacle 2's highest point), ensuring it's still safely away from the obstacle. Let's choose (0.5, 6.5). 
3. **Proceed Right:**  Now that we are clear of Obstacle 2, we can move rightward towards the goal. A safe waypoint would be (4.5, 6.5), aligning with the goal's x-coordinate.
4. **Descend to Goal:**  Finally, move downward from (4.5, 6.5) to (4.5, 4.5), reaching the goal set.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 6.5), 
    (4.5, 6.5), 
    (4.5, 4.5)

[08/22/2024 09:54:41 AM] The original path intersects with Obstacle 2 because it attempts to go above it in a straight line. To avoid this, we can adjust the path to go around Obstacle 2. 

First, we can start from the initial point (0.5, 0.5).  We need to navigate around Obstacle 2, which extends upwards significantly. To do this, we can first move to the right, clearing the x-coordinate of Obstacle 2 before moving upwards.  

Therefore, a point past the rightmost x-coordinate of Obstacle 2 would be safe.  A suitable waypoint could be (5.5, 0.5). From here, we can safely move upwards to a point above Obstacle 2, such as (5.5, 6.5).

Finally, we can move horizontally to the left to reach the goal set. The final waypoint can be (4.5, 4.5), which is inside the goal set.

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (5.5, 0.5),
    (5.5, 6.5),
    (4.5, 4.5)
