# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:55:54 AM] A viable path could first navigate around the right side of Obstacle 2, then proceed eastward, and finally move upward to reach the goal. Here's a possible waypoint representation:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set.
    (2.0, 0.5),    # Move right, staying clear of Obstacle 2.
    (2.0, 3.0),    # Move upward, maintaining a safe distance from Obstacle 2.
    (3.0, 3.0),    # Continue moving rightward, staying below Obstacle 2.
    (5.5, 3.0),    # Move further right, clear of Obstacle 1. 
    (5.5, 4.5)     # Move upward to end within the goal set.
]
```

**Explanation:**

* The path starts at (0.5, 0.5), well within the start set.
* It first moves right, then upward to circumvent Obstacle 2.
* By maintaining an x-coordinate greater than 2 and less than 4, and a y-coordinate less than 4, the path avoids intersecting Obstacle 2. 
* Once clear of Obstacle 2, the path moves rightward beyond Obstacle 1.
* Finally, it moves upward to reach (5.5, 4.5), which falls within the goal set.

**Important:** This is just one possible path. Other valid paths might exist. The key is to carefully analyze the obstacle positions and plan a path that avoids any intersection.

[08/22/2024 09:56:20 AM] The initial path attempts to go through the middle of Obstacle 2, which is problematic. We need to find a way around this obstacle. 

Looking at the layout:

1. **Starting Point:** We can start from the same point (0.5, 0.5).

2. **Navigating Obstacle 2:**  Obstacle 2 extends further to the right than any part of the goal set.  To avoid it, we need to direct the path upwards before reaching Obstacle 2, then move right towards the goal set.

3. **Reaching the Goal Set:** Once we've cleared Obstacle 2 by moving upward sufficiently, we can proceed horizontally to the right, and finally, adjust downwards to enter the goal set.

Here's a possible revised path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   // Start Point
    (0.5, 3.0),   // Move upward, clearing Obstacle 2's highest point 
    (5.5, 3.0),   // Move right, clear of all obstacles
    (4.5, 4.5)    // Move down into the goal set
] 
```

This path avoids all obstacles and reaches the goal set successfully.

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:56:26 AM] The original path attempts to go through Obstacle 2. To correct this, we need to navigate around this obstacle. 

1. **Starting Point:** Keep the starting point at (0.5, 0.5).
2. **Navigating Obstacle 2:** Obstacle 2 extends upwards significantly, reaching a y-coordinate of 6. We need to route the path around the top of this obstacle.
3. **Reaching the Goal:** Once we clear Obstacle 2, we can proceed towards the goal.

Considering these points, here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   // Start point
    (0.5, 7.0),   // Move upwards to clear Obstacle 2
    (5.5, 7.0),   // Move rightwards towards the goal
    (4.5, 4.5)    // Move down into the goal set 
]
```

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:56:33 AM] The original path attempts to go above obstacle 2, but the segment connecting (0.5, 0.5) to (0.5, 7.0) intersects obstacle 2. 

To fix this, we can route the path around the left side of obstacle 2:

1. **Start:** Keep the starting point at (0.5, 0.5).
2. **Go Left:** Move left to a point that's clear of obstacle 2. For example,  (-2.5, 0.5). 
3. **Go Up:** Move upwards to a point above obstacle 2, ensuring you are also clear of obstacle 1.  For example, (-2.5, 7.0).
4. **Go Right:**  Move rightwards towards the goal, passing above obstacle 2.  For example, (5.5, 7.0).
5. **Reach the Goal:** Finally, move down to a point within the goal set, such as (4.5, 4.5).

Therefore, the corrected path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (-2.5, 0.5), 
    (-2.5, 7.0),
    (5.5, 7.0),
    (4.5, 4.5)
]
``` 

[08/22/2024 09:56:33 AM] Parsed response: [(0.5, 0.5), (-2.5, 0.5), (-2.5, 7.0), (5.5, 7.0), (4.5, 4.5)]
[08/22/2024 09:56:34 AM] Starts in init: True, Ends in goal: True
[08/22/2024 09:56:34 AM] Path is successful
