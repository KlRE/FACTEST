# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:57:38 AM] It seems like Obstacle 2 is defined in a way that makes it non-convex (its edges cross), I'll assume you meant:
Obstacle 2: [[-2.0, 4.0], [0.0, 6.0], [5.0, 1.0], [3.0, -1.0]] 

There's a clear path around the right side of the obstacles:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 0.5),   # Start inside the starting quadrilateral
    (2.0, 0.5),   # Move slightly right 
    (2.0, -1.0),  # Move down, clear of Obstacle 1
    (7.0, -1.0),  # Move right, staying clear of Obstacle 1 
    (7.0, 1.0),   # Move up, clear of Obstacle 1 and 2
    (7.0, 5.0),   # Continue moving up, clear of Obstacle 2
    (5.0, 5.0)    # Move left to end inside the goal quadrilateral

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:57:47 AM] The primary issue with the previous path was that it attempted to navigate through Obstacle 2 rather than around it. 

Here's a revised approach:

1. **Starting Point:** Begin at (1.0, 0.5), which is within the start set.

2. **Navigate Below Obstacle 2:** To avoid Obstacle 2 entirely, we'll route the path below it. This involves several steps:
    * Move down to (1.0, -1.0) to be well clear of Obstacle 2's lowest point.
    * Move right, staying below Obstacle 2, to (3.5, -1.0). 

3. **Navigate Around Obstacle 1:** Obstacle 1 presents a challenge as it blocks the direct path to the goal. We'll navigate around it:
    *  Move further right to (7.0, -1.0), putting us to the right of both obstacles.
    *  Move up to (7.0, 5.0), clearing the top of Obstacle 1.

4. **Reach the Goal:**  With obstacles cleared, move left to (5.0, 5.0), which is inside the goal set.


**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 0.5),
    (1.0, -1.0),
    (3.5, -1.0),
    (7.0, -1.0),

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:57:53 AM] The issue lies in the third segment of the path going from (3.5, -1.0) to (7.0, -1.0). This segment cuts through Obstacle 1. 

To fix this, we can adjust the path to go around Obstacle 1. Since the goal is to reach the goal set which is above and to the right, we can route the path upwards before Obstacle 1, then right towards the goal.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 0.5),    
    (1.0, -1.0),   
    (3.0, -1.0),  # Move right, staying below Obstacle 1
    (3.0, 3.0),  # Move upward, clearing Obstacle 1
    (7.0, 3.0),  # Move right, clearing Obstacle 2 
    (7.0, 5.0),  
    (5.0, 5.0)   
]
```

This path first navigates below Obstacle 1, then goes up to clear it, and finally moves right to reach the goal set while avoiding both obstacles.

[08/22/2024 09:58:20 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate around obstacle 2 from below. However, the feedback highlights intersections with segments connecting (3.0, -1.0) to (3.0, 3.0) and (3.0, 3.0) to (7.0, 3.0).

Let's adjust the strategy:

1. **Navigate above obstacle 2:** Instead of going below, we can route the path above obstacle 2 to avoid the reported intersections.
2. **Maintain a safe distance:**  To ensure obstacle avoidance, the path needs to stay clear of obstacle 2's vertices. 

Considering these points, a revised path could be:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 0.5),   # Start within the start set.
    (1.0, 7.0),   # Move vertically upwards, clear of all obstacles.
    (7.0, 7.0),   # Move horizontally to the right, staying above obstacle 2. 
    (7.0, 5.0),   # Move vertically downwards to align with the goal set.
    (5.0, 5.0)    # Move horizontally to reach the goal point within the goal set.
]
```

This revised path avoids obstacle intersections by taking a route above obstacle 2, ensuring a safe distance from all obstacles.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]

			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]]

    
## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.0, 0.5), (1.0, 7.0), (7.0, 7.0), (7.0, 5.0), (5.0, 5.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    Obstacle Avoidance (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
		Segment 1 between points (1.0, 0.5) and (1.0, 7.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 2: [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]]
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:58:37 AM] The initial path crosses obstacle 2 because the second waypoint is too far north. To correct this, we can make the path go around the south side of obstacle 2. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 0.5),   # Start within the start set
    (3.0, 0.5),   # Move right, staying below obstacle 2
    (3.0, 3.0),   # Move up, staying to the left of obstacle 2
    (5.0, 3.0),   # Move right, clearing obstacle 2
    (5.0, 5.0)    # Move up to reach the goal set 
] 
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Waypoint 2 (3.0, 0.5):**  Instead of moving directly north, the path now moves horizontally to the right, staying below the lower y-coordinate of obstacle 2.
2. **Waypoint 3 (3.0, 3.0):** The path then moves upwards, staying to the left of obstacle 2's rightmost x-coordinate.
3. **Waypoint 4 (5.0, 3.0):**  The path continues moving right, clearing obstacle 2 completely.
4. **Waypoint 5 (5.0, 5.0):** Finally, the path moves upwards to reach the desired endpoint within the goal set.

]

[08/22/2024 09:58:43 AM] The initial path attempts to move horizontally across the space, leading to intersections with Obstacle 2. A more viable approach involves navigating around Obstacle 2 entirely.

Here's a possible path adjustment:

1. **Start:**  (1.0, 0.5) - Remains valid within the start set. 
2. **Downwards:** (1.0, -1.0) - Move downwards, clearing the lower boundary of Obstacle 2.
3. **Rightwards:** (6.0, -1.0) - Move rightwards, staying clear of both obstacles.
4. **Upwards:** (6.0, 5.0) - Move upwards, clearing the upper boundary of Obstacle 2.
5. **Goal:** (5.0, 5.0) - Move leftwards into the goal set.

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [(1.0, 0.5), (1.0, -1.0), (6.0, -1.0), (6.0, 5.0), (5.0, 5.0)]

[08/22/2024 09:58:50 AM] The initial path goes too far south and attempts to traverse horizontally at y = -1, leading to collisions with Obstacle 1. It also tries to move directly upwards at x = 6, again colliding with Obstacle 1. 

To rectify this, the path needs to navigate around Obstacle 1 completely.  

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Start:** Keep the starting point at (1.0, 0.5). 
2. **Navigate Upwards:** Move vertically upwards to a point above the obstacles. For example, (1.0, 3.0). This avoids any horizontal slices through Obstacle 1.
3. **Navigate Rightwards:** Move horizontally rightwards towards the goal, passing above both obstacles. For example, (5.5, 3.0). 
4. **Descend to Goal:** Finally, move downwards to a point within the goal set. For example, (5.0, 4.5).

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 0.5),
    (1.0, 3.0), 
    (5.5, 3.0), 
    (5.0, 4.5)

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:58:56 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate directly to the goal set but encounters obstacles along the way. To correct this, the path needs to maneuver around Obstacle 2 specifically.

1. **Start Point:** Keeping the start point at (1.0, 0.5) is fine.

2. **Navigating Obstacle 2:**  The key is to plot a course that goes "behind" Obstacle 2.  We can achieve this by:

    * **Waypoint 1:** Moving upward to a y-coordinate greater than 6.0 to clear Obstacle 2. Let's choose (1.0, 6.5).
    * **Waypoint 2:** Moving horizontally to the right, clearing the x-coordinate of Obstacle 2. A suitable waypoint could be (5.5, 6.5).

3. **Reaching the Goal:** From (5.5, 6.5), we can move directly downward into the goal set. 

Therefore, the corrected path is:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 0.5),   
    (1.0, 6.5),   
    (5.5, 6.5),  
    (5.0, 4.5)

]

[08/22/2024 09:59:02 AM] The original path intersects with Obstacle 2 because it attempts to move directly upwards from the start set. To avoid this, the path needs to first navigate around Obstacle 2 before heading towards the goal.

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Start:** Begin at the same starting point (1.0, 0.5).
2. **Navigate Right:** Move rightwards, staying clear of Obstacle 2. A safe waypoint could be (3.5, 0.5), ensuring a safe distance from the obstacle's bottom-right vertex.
3. **Move Upwards:**  Proceed upwards, safely past Obstacle 2. A suitable waypoint is (3.5, 6.5), well above the obstacle's top-right vertex.
4. **Reach Goal:** Finally, move leftwards to reach the goal set. The endpoint (5.0, 4.5) remains valid.

Therefore, the corrected path is:

```
new_path = [(1.0, 0.5), (3.5, 0.5), (3.5, 6.5), (5.0, 4.5)]

[08/22/2024 09:59:19 AM] The original path attempts to cross Obstacle 2 directly. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle. 

1. **Starting Point:**  The initial waypoint (1.0, 0.5) is fine as it lies within the start set.

2. **Navigating Obstacle 2:**  Obstacle 2 presents a complex shape to navigate around. A viable option is to move above it:
    *  Move upward from (1.0, 0.5) to a point above the obstacle's highest y-coordinate. Let's choose (1.0, 7.0). 
    *  Move rightward, staying above Obstacle 2, until clear to descend towards the goal. A suitable waypoint is (6.0, 7.0).

3. **Reaching the Goal:** Now clear of obstacles, the path can move directly to a point within the goal set. The point (5.0, 4.5) suffices.

Therefore, the revised path is:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 0.5),

[08/22/2024 09:59:24 AM] The original path crosses obstacle 2 because it attempts to move directly upwards from the start set. To avoid this, the path should first navigate around the left side of obstacle 2 before proceeding to the goal set.

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (-3.0, 0.5),   # Move left, clear of obstacle 2
    (-3.0, 7.0),   # Move upwards, clear of obstacle 2
    (6.0, 7.0),    # Move rightwards 
    (5.0, 4.5)     # Move down to the goal set 
]
```
