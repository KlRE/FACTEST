# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:00:47 AM] A viable path can be visualized by traveling above the obstacles towards the goal.

*   Start at (0.5, 0.5) within the start set.
*   Move upward to (0.5, 6.0) to avoid both obstacles. 
*   Travel rightward to (5.0, 6.0), staying clear of the obstacles.
*   Finally, descend to (4.5, 4.5) within the goal set.

Therefore, a possible path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 6.0), 
    (5.0, 6.0), 
    (4.5, 4.5)

]

[08/22/2024 10:00:52 AM] The initial path crosses obstacle 2 because it attempts to go above the obstacle in a straight line. 

To fix this, the path should be adjusted to navigate around the obstacle. We can achieve this by first moving rightward, then upwards, and finally towards the goal.

Here's a possible updated path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   // Start within the start set
    (3.0, 0.5),   // Move rightward, staying below Obstacle 2
    (3.0, 6.0),   // Move upwards, clear of Obstacle 2
    (5.0, 6.0),   // Move rightward to align with the goal set
    (4.5, 4.5)    // Move down into the goal set 
]
```

This path avoids obstacle 2 by going around it and stays clear of obstacle 1.

[08/22/2024 10:01:04 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate directly to the goal but intersects with Obstacle 2. To correct this, the path needs to maneuver around Obstacle 2. 

1. **Starting Point:** Keep the starting point at (0.5, 0.5).

2. **Navigating Obstacle 2:**  Obstacle 2 extends upwards to y=6 and has a complex shape. To completely avoid it, it's safer to navigate below it.

3. **Waypoint below Obstacle 2:** Add a waypoint at (0.5, -1.0) to move below all obstacles.

4. **Moving Towards the Goal:** From (0.5, -1.0), the path can move horizontally towards the goal without encountering obstacles. Add a waypoint at (5.0, -1.0).

5. **Reaching the Goal:**  Finally, move upwards from (5.0, -1.0) to reach the goal set.

[08/22/2024 10:01:15 AM] The original path's segment from (0.5, -1.0) to (5.0, -1.0) attempts to pass below both obstacles, which won't work.  Instead, we can route the path above all obstacles.  

Let's aim for a waypoint around (2.5, 7.0), which is safely above Obstacle 2.  This allows a straight shot to the goal without intersecting any obstacle. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]]

    
## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.5, 0.5), (2.5, 7.0), (4.5, 4.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    Obstacle Avoidance (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
		Segment 1 between points (0.5, 0.5) and (2.5, 7.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 2: [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]]
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

### Provided Data

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:01:20 AM] The initial path cuts through obstacle 2. To avoid this, we can adjust the path to go around this obstacle. 

1. **Starting Point:** We keep the starting point at (0.5, 0.5).

2. **Avoiding Obstacle 2:**  Obstacle 2 extends upwards to y=6.0 and to the right until roughly x=5.0.  We can navigate around it by first moving right towards the right edge of the start set, then upwards to a point above the obstacle, and finally heading towards the goal.

3. **Reaching the Goal:** From a point above and clear of Obstacle 2, we can move directly to the goal set.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   // Start point
    (1.0, 0.5),   // Move right, staying within the start set
    (1.0, 6.5),   // Move up to a point clearly above Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)    // Move to the center of the goal set 
]
```

]

[08/22/2024 10:01:27 AM] The feedback correctly points out that the  segment from (1.0, 0.5) to (1.0, 6.5) cuts through Obstacle 2.  We need to adjust the path to navigate around this obstacle. 

Let's route the path to go around the left side of Obstacle 2:

1. **From the start:** Keep the first waypoint (0.5, 0.5).
2. **Navigate left:**  Introduce a waypoint to the left of Obstacle 2, for example,  (-2.5, 0.5).
3. **Move upwards:** Go above Obstacle 2 with a waypoint at (-2.5, 6.5).
4. **Approach the goal:** Add a waypoint to approach the goal from the left, such as (4.5, 6.5).
5. **Reach the goal:**  Keep the final waypoint (4.5, 4.5).

Here's the revised path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (-2.5, 0.5), 
    (-2.5, 6.5), 
    (4.5, 6.5),
    (4.5, 4.5)
]
