# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

]

[08/22/2024 09:56:38 AM] A viable path can be visualized by traveling between the first and second obstacles provided. The path will involve starting within the start quadrilateral and moving directly right, passing below the first obstacle. It will then proceed upwards, navigating between the space provided by the first and second obstacle. Finally, the path will culminate upon reaching a point within the goal quadrilateral. 

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Starting point within the start quadrilateral
    (3.0, 0.5),  # Moving rightwards below Obstacle 1
    (3.0, 3.0),  # Moving upwards between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2

[08/22/2024 09:56:45 AM] The original path crosses obstacle 2 multiple times. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle.

1. **Starting Point:** (0.5, 0.5) is fine.
2. **Navigating Obstacle 2:** Obstacle 2 extends upwards significantly and has a complex shape making it difficult to pass above. It's easier to go below it: 
    * Move down to  (0.5, -1.0) to ensure a safe distance below the lowest point of obstacle 2.
    * Move right, staying below obstacle 2 to (5.5, -1.0). This ensures a clear path to the goal.
3. **Reaching the Goal:** From (5.5, -1.0), move directly upwards to (5.5, 4.5) which lies within the goal set.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),

[08/22/2024 09:56:50 AM] The initial path went too far south and crossed through Obstacle 1.  We need a path that goes north to avoid the obstacles and reach the goal.

2. **Go North:** (0.5, 2.5) -  Move north, staying clear of Obstacle 2. 
3. **Go East:** (5.5, 2.5) -  Move east, staying well below Obstacle 2.

[08/22/2024 09:57:17 AM] The previous path attempt failed to navigate around Obstacle 2.  To correct this, the path needs to route around this obstacle.

1. **Starting Point:** (0.5, 0.5) is a valid starting point within the start set.

2. **Navigating Obstacle 2:** Obstacle 2 presents a more complex shape.  To go around it, we can first move to the right, staying below its lower boundary. Then, we can proceed upward, staying to the right of its rightmost edge.

3. **Reaching the Goal Set:** Once we clear Obstacle 2, we can safely move left and then down to reach the goal set.

Here is a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start
    (3.0, -1.0),   # Move right, staying below Obstacle 2
    (5.5, -1.0),   # Continue right
    (5.5, 4.5),    # Move upward, clearing Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Move left to the goal set
]
```

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]]

    
## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.5, 0.5), (3.0, -1.0), (5.5, -1.0), (5.5, 4.5), (4.5, 4.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    Obstacle Avoidance (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
		Segment 1 between points (0.5, 0.5) and (3.0, -1.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 2: [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]]
		Segment 2 between points (3.0, -1.0) and (5.5, -1.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]]
		Segment 3 between points (5.5, -1.0) and (5.5, 4.5) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]]
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:57:24 AM] The original path fails to avoid obstacles, particularly Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2. 

1. **Segment 1 Issue:** The first segment crosses Obstacle 2. To fix this, we can route the path around the obstacle.

2. **Navigating Obstacle 1:** To completely avoid Obstacle 1, the path needs to go below it (y < -2.0) or above it (staying above y = 0). 

3. **Segment 2 and 3 Issues:** Both segments intersect Obstacle 1. We need to reroute the path to avoid this.

Considering these points, here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),      // Start within the start set
    (0.5, -3.0),     // Move down, clear of Obstacle 2, to a point well below Obstacle 1 
    (5.5, -3.0),     // Move right, staying clear below Obstacle 1
    (5.5, 4.5),     // Move up to the level of the goal set
    (4.5, 4.5)      // Move left to end within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

* **Waypoint 2:** Moves significantly downward to ensure a safe distance from both Obstacle 2 and the bottom of Obstacle 1. 
* **Waypoint 3:** Moves right, maintaining a safe distance below Obstacle 1.
* **Waypoint 4 and 5:** Navigate directly to the goal set from a safe position. 

This revised path ensures obstacle avoidance by strategically navigating around the obstacles.

[08/22/2024 09:57:29 AM] The feedback indicated that the segment connecting (5.5, -3.0) and (5.5, 4.5) cuts through Obstacle 1. To rectify this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle. 

A viable solution involves extending the detour further down, moving around Obstacle 1 before heading towards the goal.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  
    (0.5, -3.0), 
    (7.0, -3.0),  # Move further right, clear of Obstacle 1
