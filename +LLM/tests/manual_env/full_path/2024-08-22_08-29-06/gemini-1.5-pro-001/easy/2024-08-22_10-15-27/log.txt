# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]

    
## Instructions

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:15:37 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate directly to the goal set but intersects with Obstacle 2. To rectify this, the path needs to be adjusted to circumvent this obstacle. 

1. **Initial Segment:** The first segment from (0.5, 0.5) to (0.5, 3.0) cuts through Obstacle 2.  We need to reroute this segment.

2. **Circumventing Obstacle 2:**  Obstacle 2 occupies a space between x-coordinates -2.0 and 3.0. To avoid it, we can route the path above this obstacle (y-coordinate greater than 4.0). 

3.  **Reaching the Goal:** From a point above Obstacle 2, we can plot a direct route to the goal set.

Therefore, a corrected path might look like this:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    // Starting point
    (0.5, 4.5),    // Move upwards to clear Obstacle 2
    (5.0, 4.5)     // Move rightwards to the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:15:43 AM] The initial path crosses obstacle 2 because it goes vertically straight through its center. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle. 

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Start:** Keep the starting point at (0.5, 0.5).
2. **Move Right:** Navigate to the right, moving beyond the right edge of Obstacle 2 before going up. Let's set a waypoint at (3.5, 0.5).
3. **Move Up:** Now safely above Obstacle 1 and to the right of Obstacle 2, move upwards towards the goal. Let's set a waypoint at (3.5, 4.5).
4. **Reach Goal:** Finally, move left to enter the goal set. The endpoint can be (4.5, 4.5).

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:15:50 AM] The original path has collisions because it tries to cross directly through the obstacles. To fix this, the path needs to be adjusted to move around the obstacles.

Looking at the obstacles, we can see that:
* Obstacle 1 blocks the direct path to the right at a low y-coordinate.
* Obstacle 2 blocks the direct path to the right at a high y-coordinate.

There's a space between obstacles 1 and 2 where the path can pass. 

Here's a possible solution for a new path:

1. **Start:** (0.5, 0.5) - Same as the original path.
2. **Move Up:** (0.5, 3.5) -  Move up to a y-coordinate that is above Obstacle 1 and below Obstacle 2.
3. **Move Right:** (4.5, 3.5) - Move right, staying within the space between the obstacles. 
4. **Move Down:** (4.5, 4.5) - Move down to reach the goal set.

**Therefore, the new path is:**

```python
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 3.5), 
    (4.5, 3.5), 
    (4.5, 4.5)

[08/22/2024 10:16:18 AM] The initial path attempts to move directly from the start to the goal, resulting in collisions with Obstacle 2. To rectify this, the path needs to navigate around Obstacle 2. 

One approach is to skirt the lower-left corner of Obstacle 2. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set.
    (0.5, 1.5),    # Move upwards to avoid the lower horizontal boundary of Obstacle 2.
    (-1.0, 1.5),   # Move leftwards, clearing the left boundary of Obstacle 2.
    (-1.0, 3.5),   # Move upwards, passing Obstacle 2 vertically.
    (4.5, 3.5),    # Move rightwards towards the goal set.
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Reach a point within the goal set.
]
```

This revised path avoids both obstacles:

1. **Segment 1 & 2:** Moves vertically, clear of both obstacles.
2. **Segment 3:** Moves leftwards into an open space, still clear of obstacles.
3. **Segment 4:** Moves upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 2's left side. 
4. **Segment 5 & 6:** Moves rightwards and upwards directly to the goal, encountering no obstacles.

[08/22/2024 10:16:28 AM] The feedback indicated that segments 3 and 4 of the initial path intersected with Obstacle 2.  Looking at the coordinates, it's clear that moving directly from (-1.0, 1.5) to (-1.0, 3.5) cuts through the middle of Obstacle 2.  Similarly, going from (-1.0, 3.5) directly to (4.5, 3.5) also cuts through Obstacle 2.

To fix this, the path needs to navigate around Obstacle 2.  Since the obstacle is positioned diagonally, we can adjust the path to go around it either by going above or below.

For this correction, let's go below Obstacle 2:

1.  **From (-1.0, 1.5):** Instead of moving directly up to (1.0, 3.5),  move horizontally to the right, clearing the rightmost x-coordinate of Obstacle 2 which is at x = 3.0. So the next waypoint will be (3.5, 1.5).
2.  **From (3.5, 1.5):**  Now we can safely move vertically down, clearing the lowest y-coordinate of Obstacle 2 which is at y = 2.0. Let's go to (3.5, 1.5).
3.  **From (3.5, 1.5):** Finally, move horizontally to the left to approach the goal position.  We can go to (4.5, 1.5).

This avoids Obstacle 2 entirely.  

Therefore, the corrected path is:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 1.5), (-1.0, 1.5), (3.5, 1.5), (3.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), (4.5, 4.5)]
```
