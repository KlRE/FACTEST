# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:12:42 AM] Here is a possible path considering the provided obstacles and start/goal regions:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 0.5),    # Start at the middle of the right edge of the start zone.
    (1.0, 3.0),    # Move straight up to a point above the obstacles.
    (5.0, 3.0),    # Move horizontally, clear of obstacles, towards the goal.
    (5.0, 4.5)     # Move straight down to the center of the goal zone.
]
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting Point:** The path begins at (1.0, 0.5), safely within the start quadrilateral.
* **Maneuvering Around Obstacles:**  
    * The path first moves vertically upward to (1.0, 3.0), clearing Obstacle 1 and positioning itself above Obstacle 2.
    * Then, it moves horizontally to (5.0, 3.0), bypassing both obstacles entirely.
* **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, the path moves straight down to (5.0, 4.5), ending within the goal quadrilateral. 

**Important:** This is a visual inspection solution. Using an algorithm to verify non-intersection with the obstacles is crucial for robust path planning.

### Example Response

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:12:47 AM] The original path attempts to move directly from the start set to the goal set. However, this is impeded by Obstacle 2 which spans a large portion of the y-axis. 

To circumvent this, the path needs to navigate around Obstacle 2. One way to do this is by initially moving to the right, clearing Obstacle 1, then proceeding upwards to avoid Obstacle 2, and finally moving towards the goal.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 0.5),   # Start within the start set
    (2.5, 0.5),   # Move right, clearing Obstacle 1 
    (2.5, 4.5),   # Move upwards, clearing Obstacle 2
    (5.0, 4.5)    # Move right to the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:12:56 AM] The original path attempts to navigate between the two obstacles but fails to stay clear of obstacle 1.

2. **Navigate below obstacle 1:** Move to a point with a y-coordinate less than 0, for example (1.0, -0.5).
3. **Move towards the goal:**  Proceed horizontally towards the goal, for example to (4.5, -0.5).
4. **Reach the goal:**  Finally, move upwards to reach the goal set, for example at (4.5, 4.5).
