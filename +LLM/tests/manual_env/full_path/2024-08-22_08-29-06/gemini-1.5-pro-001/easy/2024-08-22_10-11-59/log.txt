# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:12:05 AM] The provided environment has a bottleneck-like structure created by the two obstacles. 

1. **Starting Point:** We can choose the top-left corner of the start set (1.0, 1.0) as our starting waypoint. 

2. **Navigating the Bottleneck:**
    * To avoid Obstacle 1, we need to steer clear of its top-right corner (4.0, 1.0).  
    * Simultaneously, we need to navigate around the bottom-left corner of Obstacle 2 ( -2.0, 2.0). 

3. **Reaching the Goal:** Once we clear the bottleneck, there's a straight path to the goal set. We can aim for the bottom-left corner of the goal set (4.0, 4.0).

Therefore, a potential path could be:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start
    (1.0, 3.0),    # Move up, clearing Obstacle 1
    (0.0, 3.0),    # Move left, clearing the bottleneck 
    (4.0, 4.0)     # Move straight to the goal 
]
```

4.  **Approach Goal:** Move upwards towards the goal. A suitable waypoint could be (3.5, 4.5).
5.  **Reach Goal:**  Move horizontally to reach the goal set at (4.5, 4.5).

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:12:22 AM] The initial path goes right through Obstacle 1. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle. There are two main options: go above or below it. 

- **Above Obstacle 1:** This approach is constrained by Obstacle 2.  A path above Obstacle 1 would need to navigate a relatively narrow passage between Obstacles 1 and 2. 

- **Below Obstacle 1:** This option seems more straightforward. The path can move below Obstacle 1 and then proceed towards the goal without encountering other obstacles.

Therefore, adjusting the path to go below Obstacle 1:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),   # Start in the start set
    (1.0, -0.5),  # Move down, clearing Obstacle 1
    (5.0, -0.5),  # Move right, staying clear of Obstacle 1 
    (5.0, 4.5)    # Move up to end in the goal set
