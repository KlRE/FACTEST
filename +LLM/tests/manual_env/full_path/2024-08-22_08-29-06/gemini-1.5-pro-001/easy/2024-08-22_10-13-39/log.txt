# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [

]

[08/22/2024 10:13:43 AM] The path can be planned to first move to the right, above obstacle 1. Then, the path can move upwards, between obstacle 1 and 2. Finally, the path can move to the right to reach the goal set.

    (2.0, 1.5),   # Move right, staying below obstacle 2 
    (2.0, 3.0),   # Move upward, passing between obstacles 1 and 2
    (4.5, 3.0),   # Move right towards the goal set

[08/22/2024 10:13:54 AM] The initial path goes through obstacle 2. To avoid this, we can adjust the path to go around obstacle 2. 

Instead of going straight up and encountering obstacle 2, we can first navigate to the right side of obstacle 1. From there, we can move upwards, clear of both obstacles, and then proceed towards the goal.

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start within the start set.
    (4.0, 0.5),   # Move to the right, clearing obstacle 1.
    (4.0, 3.0),   # Move upwards, staying clear of obstacle 2. 
    (4.5, 3.0),   # Move right towards the goal set.
    (4.5, 4.5)    # Arrive at a point within the goal set.

[08/22/2024 10:14:15 AM] The initial path goes through obstacle 1. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle. One way to do this is to go below the obstacle. 

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start within the start set
    (0.5, -0.5), # Move down to clear the lower bound of Obstacle 1
    (4.5, -0.5), # Move right to clear the right bound of Obstacle 1
    (4.5, 4.5)   # Move up into the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(0.5, 0.5):** Starts within the start set.
2. **(0.5, -0.5):** Moves straight down, ensuring a safe distance from Obstacle 1.
3. **(4.5, -0.5):** Moves right, staying below Obstacle 1 and avoiding Obstacle 2.
4. **(4.5, 4.5):** Moves straight up into the goal set.
