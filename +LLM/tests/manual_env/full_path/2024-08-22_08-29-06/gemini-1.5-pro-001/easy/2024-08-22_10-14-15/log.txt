# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]

    
## Instructions

    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:14:20 AM] The provided environment has a large open space between the start and goal areas. Obstacle 1 blocks a direct path at the bottom, and Obstacle 2 blocks a direct path at the top. 

We can design a path that first moves above Obstacle 1, then navigates around the left side of Obstacle 2 to reach the goal.

Here's a possible path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start quadrilateral
    (0.5, 2.0),    # Move upwards to clear Obstacle 1 
    (-1.0, 2.0),   # Move left to clear Obstacle 2 
    (-1.0, 5.0),   # Move upwards to align with the goal
    (4.5, 5.0)    # Move rightwards to the center of the goal quadrilateral
] 
```

[08/22/2024 10:14:26 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate around Obstacle 2 by going left, but it crosses through the obstacle. To correct this, the path needs to be adjusted to navigate around Obstacle 2 on the right side.

1. **Starting Point:** (0.5, 0.5) remains valid.
2. **Navigating Right:**  Instead of going left, the path should move right to avoid Obstacle 2. A waypoint at (2.0, 0.5) achieves this.
3. **Moving Upwards:**  From (2.0, 0.5), the path needs to go up to reach the goal. A waypoint at (2.0, 5.0) positions the path above Obstacle 2. 
4. **Reaching the Goal:**  Finally, the path can move horizontally to the right and reach the goal at (4.5, 5.0).

[08/22/2024 10:14:34 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate directly to the goal but collides with obstacles. To address this, the path needs adjustments:

1. **Initial Movement:** Starting at (0.5, 0.5), the path needs to avoid Obstacle 1. Moving directly upwards to a y-coordinate greater than 1 will clear the obstacle.

2. **Navigating Obstacle 2:** With Obstacle 1 cleared, the path needs to navigate around Obstacle 2. Since Obstacle 2's lowest y-coordinate is 2,  moving upwards to a value greater than 2 will ensure clearance.

3. **Reaching the Goal:** Now above both obstacles, the path can move horizontally to a point aligned with the goal set, and then vertically downwards to reach the goal.

Considering these adjustments, a possible path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   // Start Point
    (0.5, 1.5),   // Move up to clear Obstacle 1

[08/22/2024 10:14:39 AM] The issue is that the path cuts through Obstacle 2. To fix this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle. 

Here's how to adjust the path:

1. **Start Point:** Keep the start point at (0.5, 0.5).
2. **Navigate Below Obstacle 2:**  
   - Instead of going up immediately, move to the right, staying below Obstacle 2. A good waypoint would be (2.5, 0.5). 
3. **Move Up:** Now, safely move upwards to a point above Obstacle 2. A suitable waypoint is (2.5, 4.5).
4. **Reach the Goal:** Finally, move horizontally to reach the goal set at (4.5, 4.5).

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]

    
## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.5, 0.5), (2.5, 0.5), (2.5, 4.5), (4.5, 4.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    Obstacle Avoidance (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
		Segment 1 between points (0.5, 0.5) and (2.5, 0.5) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]
		Segment 2 between points (2.5, 0.5) and (2.5, 4.5) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:14:45 AM] The initial path attempts to go directly to the goal but intersects with both obstacles.  We need to adjust the path to navigate around these obstacles.

- **Moving Right, then Up:**  The first segment of the path could travel right, staying below obstacle 1. 
- **Navigating Between Obstacles:** Once past obstacle 1, the path can move upwards, carefully navigating the space between the right edge of obstacle 1 and the left edge of obstacle 2. 
- **Final Approach to Goal:** After clearing the obstacles, the path can then proceed left towards the goal.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Starting point within the start set
    (4.5, 0.5),    # Move right, staying below obstacle 1 
    (4.5, 2.5),    # Move up, carefully passing between obstacles 1 and 2
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Move to the center of the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:15:22 AM] The initial path went right through Obstacle 1. To avoid this, we need to route the path around this obstacle.  

1. **Initial Path Issue:** The segment from (0.5, 0.5) to (4.5, 0.5) cuts directly through Obstacle 1.

2. **Going South:** Since Obstacle 1  stretches across the x-axis from 2.0 to 4.0,  we can't go straight to the right. Let's try going south first.

3. **Navigating Obstacles:**  We can move below Obstacle 1 and then head towards the goal.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point
    (0.5, -0.5),   # Move south to clear Obstacle 1
    (4.5, -0.5),   # Move east, staying below Obstacle 1
    (4.5, 4.5)    # Move north to the goal point
]
