# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

[08/22/2024 10:13:13 AM] A viable path can be visualized by moving above the obstacles:

1. **Start:** Choose the top-center point of the start set (0.5, 1.0) 
2. **Waypoint 1:**  Move upward to (0.5, 4.5) to clear the obstacles.
3. **Waypoint 2:** Move rightward to (4.5, 4.5), directly above the goal set. 
4. **End:** Move downward to the center of the goal set (4.5, 4.5).

Therefore, the path is:

```

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:13:20 AM] The initial path crosses obstacle 2 because it attempts to go straight up through the obstacles. I need to adjust the path to navigate around obstacle 2. 

One approach is to go around obstacle 2 on the left. Here's a possible new path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 1.0),    # Start in the start set
    (0.5, 2.0),    # Move up, staying clear of obstacle 1
    (-1.0, 2.0),   # Move left, clearing obstacle 2
    (-1.0, 4.5),   # Move up, clearing obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)    # Move right to the goal set
]
```

Here's the thought process:

1. **Start Point:** Same as the original path, inside the start set.
2. **Waypoint 2 (0.5, 2.0):** Move up slightly to avoid the bottom corner of obstacle 2.
3. **Waypoint 3 (-1.0, 2.0):** Move left, getting clear of the left edge of obstacle 2.
4. **Waypoint 4 (-1.0, 4.5):**  Move up, passing above the top edge of obstacle 2.
5. **End Point (4.5, 4.5):** Move right directly to a point inside the goal set. 

This new path avoids all obstacles by navigating around them.

]

[08/22/2024 10:13:26 AM] The original path tries to navigate above obstacle 2, but the waypoints are too close or inside the obstacle.  We need to adjust the path to go below obstacle 2.

1. **Start:** Keep the starting point (0.5, 1.0) as it is inside the start set.
2. **Navigate below Obstacle 2:** Instead of moving up, we'll move down below obstacle 2. Since obstacle 2's lowest y-coordinate is 2.0, we should aim for a y-value less than 2.
3. **Clear of Obstacles:**  A waypoint around (0.5, 0.5) would be clear of both obstacles.
4. **Towards the Goal:** From (0.5, 0.5), we can move directly towards the goal without intersecting any obstacles.

Here's the updated path:

]

[08/22/2024 10:13:33 AM] The original path cuts through Obstacle 2 because it tries to take a direct route to the goal. To avoid this, we need to navigate around this obstacle. 

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Start:** We keep the first waypoint (0.5, 1.0).
2. **Navigate Downwards:** Instead of going directly towards the goal, we can first move downwards to a point below Obstacle 2. A suitable waypoint could be (0.5, 1.5).
3. **Navigate Rightwards:** Now that we're below Obstacle 2, we can safely move to the right. We can aim for a waypoint like (4.5, 1.5), which is to the right of Obstacle 2 and vertically aligned with the goal set. 
4. **Navigate Upwards:** Finally, we move upwards to reach the goal set. We keep the final waypoint (4.5, 4.5).

Therefore, the new path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 1.0),  
    (0.5, 1.5),  
    (4.5, 1.5), 
    (4.5, 4.5)   
]
```

This path avoids both obstacles and successfully reaches the goal set.
