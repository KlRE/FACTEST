# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:11:47 AM] By inspection, a possible path is:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 0.5),   # Start at the middle of the right edge of the start set
    (1.0, 3.0),   # Move straight up, staying clear of Obstacle 1
    (5.0, 3.0),   # Move right, staying clear of Obstacle 2 
    (4.5, 4.5)    # Move diagonally to the center of the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(1.0, 0.5):** Starts within the start quadrilateral.
2. **(1.0, 3.0):**  Moves vertically upwards, avoiding Obstacle 1.
3. **(5.0, 3.0):** Moves horizontally right, maintaining a safe distance from Obstacle 2. 
4. **(4.5, 4.5):**  Finally, moves diagonally to reach the center of the goal quadrilateral. 

This path ensures that all the waypoints and the segments connecting them are clear of any obstacles.

### Example Response

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:11:54 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate directly to the goal set. However, both segments cross obstacle 2. To correct this, we need to find a way around this obstacle. 

Observing the environment, we see that obstacle 2 is positioned to the left of the goal, spanning from y-coordinate 2.0 to 4.0. 

Therefore, we can adjust the path by:

1. **Moving above obstacle 2:** Instead of going directly to y = 3.0, we can navigate to a point above obstacle 2, such as y = 4.5.
2. **Moving horizontally towards the goal:**  From this elevated position, we can then move horizontally towards the goal set. 

This strategy ensures we avoid intersecting with obstacle 2 entirely.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.0, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (1.0, 4.5),    # Move above obstacle 2 
    (5.0, 4.5),    # Move horizontally to the goal set
    (4.5, 4.5)     # End within the goal set
]
