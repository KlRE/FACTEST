# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.75, 0.75], [0.25, 0.75], [0.25, 0.25], [0.75, 0.25]]

[08/22/2024 11:56:16 AM] The previous path went too far to the right and got stuck behind obstacles 5 and 6. To correct this, we need to adjust the path so it goes to the left of obstacles 5 and 6. 

Here's the new path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start within the start set.
    (0.5, 15.5),  # Move upwards, staying clear of obstacles. 
    (3.5, 15.5),  # Move right, staying above all obstacles.
    (3.5, 4.5),   # Move downwards, passing to the left of obstacles 5 and 6.
    (4.5, 4.5)    # Move right, reaching the goal set. 
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Initial Upward Movement:** The first two waypoints remain the same, ensuring a clear path above the start position and any potential obstacles in the lower region.
2. **Strategic Rightward Shift:**  Instead of moving further right, we move to (3.5, 15.5). This positions us directly above obstacle 3 and to the left of obstacles 5 and 6.
3. **Downward Approach:** From (3.5, 15.5), we descend to (3.5, 4.5), safely navigating past the left side of obstacles 5 and 6.
4. **Final Approach to Goal:** The final waypoint (4.5, 4.5) brings us directly into the goal set, successfully completing the path.

### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:56:30 AM] The initial path has several intersections with the obstacles. To correct this, the path needs adjustments:

1. **Segment 2  (5.5, 0.5) - (5.5, 15.5):** This segment attempts to move vertically along the x=5.5 line, but it intersects with Obstacles 4, 5, and 6. To avoid them, the path needs to shift to the left, staying clear of obstacle 4's right edge at x=4. 

2. **Segment 4 (3.5, 15.5) - (3.5, 4.5):** This segment attempts a vertical movement again, but this time at x=3.5, causing an intersection with Obstacle 3. It's necessary to navigate around this obstacle, either by going to its left or right. 

3. **Segment 5 (3.5, 4.5) - (4.5, 4.5):** This segment is short and aims to enter the goal set horizontally. However, it intersects with Obstacle 3. Since the goal is just to the right, a minor adjustment to stay clear of Obstacle 3's edge should suffice.

Considering these points, here's a possible corrected path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),      // Start Point
    (3.0, 0.5),      // Move horizontally, staying clear of Obstacle 4
    (3.0, 15.5),     // Move vertically, clear of all obstacles 
    (3.0, 4.5),      // Move vertically down, clear of Obstacle 3
    (4.5, 4.5)       // Move horizontally into the Goal Set
]
```

This revised path avoids all obstacles by navigating around them and ensures each segment stays clear of any intersections.

[08/22/2024 11:56:37 AM] The initial path went right through obstacle 3. To avoid this, we can route the path above obstacle 3 and then towards the goal.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (3.0, 0.5),    # Move right
    (3.0, 15.5),   # Move up, clearing all obstacles 
    (4.5, 15.5),   # Move right, staying above obstacles
    (4.5, 4.5)    # Move down into the goal set
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Initial Segment:**  The path starts the same way as before to the right.
2. **Vertical Movement:** Instead of stopping at y=15.5, the path continues upward to a point clearly above all obstacles.
3. **Horizontal Movement:** From this high point, the path moves horizontally to the right until it's directly above the goal position.
4. **Final Descent:** Finally, the path moves straight down into the goal set.

This new path avoids all obstacles while adhering to the start and end set requirements.

[08/22/2024 11:56:45 AM] The initial path has collisions because it tries to go above Obstacle 3 and below Obstacle 6, which are too close together. Instead, the path needs to go between Obstacles 3 and 5.

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (3.0, 0.5),    # Move right, staying below Obstacle 3 
    (3.0, 9.5),    # Move up, going between Obstacles 3 and 5
    (4.5, 9.5),    # Move right, staying above Obstacle 5
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Move down into the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(0.5, 0.5) -> (3.0, 0.5):** This segment moves horizontally to the right, staying well below Obstacle 3.
2. **(3.0, 0.5) -> (3.0, 9.5):**  This segment moves vertically upward, passing safely between Obstacles 3 and 5. 
3. **(3.0, 9.5) -> (4.5, 9.5):** This segment moves horizontally to the right, staying clear above Obstacle 5.
4. **(4.5, 9.5) -> (4.5, 4.5):** This final segment moves vertically downward, reaching the goal set without colliding with any obstacles.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:56:51 AM] The initial path goes through Obstacle 3. To fix this, we can adjust the path to go around this obstacle. 

1. **Start:** We can keep the starting point (0.5, 0.5).

2. **Going Up:** Instead of moving right immediately, we should move up to avoid Obstacle 3. Let's go to (0.5, 14.5) to clear the obstacle entirely.

3. **Moving Right:** Now we can safely move right towards the goal. A point like (4.5, 14.5) puts us directly above the goal area.

4. **Descending:** Finally, move down to a point within the goal set, like (4.5, 4.5).

Here's the corrected path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 14.5), 
    (4.5, 14.5), 
    (4.5, 4.5)

[08/22/2024 11:57:15 AM] The current path goes right through obstacle 6. To avoid this, we need to route the path around it.

[08/22/2024 11:57:23 AM] The issue is with the segment connecting (15.5, 4.5) and (4.5, 4.5) as it cuts through Obstacle 5. To rectify this, we need to route the path around this obstacle. 

Since the path is coming from the right side of the obstacles, it would be more efficient to go above Obstacle 5. 

Therefore, we can adjust the path as follows:

1.  Instead of going directly to (4.5, 4.5), first, move upwards to a point above Obstacle 5, ensuring to stay clear of its top-left corner (5.0, 10.0). A safe waypoint could be (15.5, 11.0).
2.  From (15.5, 11.0), move leftwards, clearing the obstacle, and reaching a point above the goal set. A suitable waypoint is (4.5, 11.0).
3.  Finally, move downwards from (4.5, 11.0) to the goal position (4.5, 4.5). 

Here is the corrected path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 14.5), 
    (15.5, 14.5), 
    (15.5, 11.0), # move upwards to clear Obstacle 5
    (4.5, 11.0),  # move leftwards above Obstacle 5
    (4.5, 4.5)   # move downwards to the goal
]
```

This new path successfully avoids all obstacles and reaches the goal position.

[08/22/2024 11:57:31 AM] The feedback indicates that the path intersects with Obstacle 6 in two segments. To avoid this, we need to adjust the path to go around this obstacle. 

Here's a possible thought process and the adjusted path:

1. **Analyze the problem:** The current path tries to cut horizontally across the map, hitting Obstacle 6. 
2. **Identify a safer route:** We can navigate around Obstacle 6 by going below it.
3. **Adjust the waypoints:**
    - Keep the first three waypoints the same: `(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 14.5), (15.5, 14.5)`.
    - Instead of going directly to `(15.5, 11.0)`, which intersects Obstacle 6,  move further to the right to `(15.5, 3.5)` to completely bypass the obstacle.
    - From there, move left towards the goal, adding a waypoint at `(4.5, 3.5)`.
    - Finally, move up to reach the goal at `(4.5, 4.5)`.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.75, 0.75], [0.25, 0.75], [0.25, 0.25], [0.75, 0.25]]

[08/22/2024 11:57:41 AM] The original path attempts to navigate directly from the start to the goal set by going above obstacles 3 and 4. However, this leads to collisions. 

To avoid this, the new path will take advantage of the space between obstacles 3 and 5, then between obstacles 5 and 6. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),     // Start within the start set
    (0.5, 14.5),    // Move upwards, staying clear of obstacle 2
    (4.5, 14.5),    // Move rightwards, passing above obstacle 6
    (4.5, 9.5),     // Move downwards, navigating between obstacles 5 and 6
    (4.5, 3.5),     // Continue downwards, now between obstacles 4 and 5
    (4.5, 4.5)      // Finally, move rightwards into the goal set
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles while successfully reaching the goal set.

[08/22/2024 11:57:49 AM] The initial path was trying to navigate too close to the obstacles and got stuck. The main issue was the path going to (4.5, 14.5) and then straight down. This caused collisions with Obstacles 6 and 4. 

Here's a revised approach:

1. **Start:** Keep the starting point at (0.5, 0.5).
2. **Go Up:**  Instead of going all the way to y=14.5, let's aim for a point above Obstacle 6, say (0.5, 11.5).
3. **Navigate Right:** Move rightwards, staying clear of Obstacle 6, towards a point like (3.5, 11.5).
4. **Descend:**  Carefully descend downwards, staying to the left of Obstacles 5 and 4. A good target would be (3.5, 3.5).
5. **Reach Goal:** Finally, move rightwards to the goal position at (4.5, 4.5).

**New Path:**

```

]

[08/22/2024 11:58:33 AM] The path goes too far to the right, causing collisions with obstacles 5 and 6. The path needs to stay further to the left to avoid these. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 15.5),  # Move upwards, staying clear of obstacles
    (3.5, 15.5),  # Move rightwards, staying above all obstacles
    (3.5, 4.5),   # Move downwards, passing to the left of obstacle 5 and 6
    (4.5, 4.5)    # Move rightwards to end within the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Stay Left:** Instead of going all the way to x=5.5, the path now aims for x=3.5, which is safely to the left of obstacles 5 and 6.
2. **Clearance Above Obstacles:** By staying at y=15.5 for a longer duration, the path avoids any risk of colliding with the top corners of obstacles 5 and 6. 
3. **Direct Descent:** Once past the obstacles, the path can safely descend directly to the goal at y=4.5.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

[08/22/2024 11:58:43 AM] The previous path intersects with Obstacle 3 because it tries to move directly to (3.5, 4.5) after going around Obstacle 2. To avoid this, the path needs to move further to the right before descending.

Here's how we can adjust the path:

1.  **Original Path:** (0.5, 0.5) -> (0.5, 15.5) -> (3.5, 15.5) -> (3.5, 4.5) -> (4.5, 4.5)
2.  **Problem:** The segment (3.5, 15.5) -> (3.5, 4.5) intersects Obstacle 3.
3.  **Solution:** Instead of moving directly down from (3.5, 15.5), move right to clear Obstacle 3, then descend.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

**new\_path = \[(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 15.5), (5.5, 15.5), (5.5, 4.5), (4.5, 4.5)\]**

**Explanation:**

*   **(0.5, 0.5) -> (0.5, 15.5):** Move vertically upwards to avoid obstacles 1 and 2.
*   **(0.5, 15.5) -> (5.5, 15.5):**  Move horizontally to the right, clearing obstacles 3, 5, and 6.
*   **(5.5, 15.5) -> (5.5, 4.5):** Move vertically downwards to align with the goal set.
*   **(5.5, 4.5) -> (4.5, 4.5):** Move horizontally to the left to reach the goal set.

This adjusted path avoids all obstacles and reaches the goal set safely.

[08/22/2024 11:59:15 AM] The original path collides with Obstacle 3 because it attempts to move directly downwards while Obstacle 3 occupies the space between y-coordinates 1.0 and 14.0 in that region.

To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around Obstacle 3. 

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 15.5),   # Move upwards, same as the original path
    (3.5, 15.5),   # Move rightwards, same as the original path 
    (3.5, 0.5),    # Move downwards, bypassing Obstacle 3 by staying to the left
    (4.5, 0.5),    # Move rightwards to align with the goal set
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Move upwards to reach the goal set
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1.  **Staying Left of Obstacle 3:** Instead of moving directly downwards from (3.5, 15.5), the new path moves downwards to (3.5, 0.5), staying to the left of Obstacle 3 and avoiding any collision. 
2.  **Approaching the Goal:** From (3.5, 0.5), the path moves rightwards to (4.5, 0.5) and then upwards to (4.5, 4.5), successfully reaching the goal set.

This new path avoids all obstacles and successfully connects the start and goal sets.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate

]

[08/22/2024 11:59:21 AM] The original path collides with obstacles 3 and 4.  To fix this, the path needs to be adjusted to route around these obstacles.

Instead of going straight up and then over, the path can first move right, avoiding obstacle 3, then up to clear obstacle 6, then left to avoid obstacle 5, and finally down to the goal. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (3.5, 0.5),    # Move right, staying clear of obstacle 3
    (3.5, 15.5),   # Move up, clearing obstacle 6 
    (0.5, 15.5),   # Move left, avoiding obstacle 5
    (0.5, 4.5),    # Move down to align with the goal set
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Move right to reach the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:59:27 AM] The initial path had two problematic segments. The segment from (3.5, 0.5) to (3.5, 15.5) crossed obstacle 3 and the segment from (0.5, 4.5) to (4.5, 4.5) also crossed obstacle 3.

To avoid obstacle 3, the path needs to navigate around it. One way to do this is to move to the right side of obstacle 3, which is unobstructed. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (3.5, 0.5),    # Move right, staying clear of obstacle 3
    (3.5, 1.5),    # Move slightly up, staying clear of obstacle 3
    (4.5, 1.5),    # Move right, staying clear of obstacle 3
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Move up to reach the goal set
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles and successfully connects the start and goal sets.

[08/22/2024 11:59:35 AM] The original path was trying to go right first and then up, leading to collisions with obstacles 3 and 4.  To avoid this, a better strategy is to move up first and then navigate rightwards.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

1. **Start:** (0.5, 0.5) - We keep the same starting point within the start set.

2. **Move Up:** (0.5, 3.5) -  This moves us safely above obstacle 3.

3. **Move Right:** (3.5, 3.5) - We can safely move right, staying clear of obstacles 3 and 4.

4. **Move Right and Slightly Up:** (4.5, 3.75) - This positions us within the goal set while avoiding obstacle 4.

5. **End:** (4.5, 4.5) - We arrive at the center of the goal set.

Therefore, the updated path is:

```

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:59:40 AM] The initial path failed to avoid obstacles primarily because it tried to move horizontally across the space before navigating around the obstacle cluster. 

To correct this, the path should first move vertically upwards, clearing obstacles 1 and 2. Then, it can safely proceed rightwards, staying clear of obstacle 3. A slight vertical adjustment will be needed to avoid obstacle 4 before finally reaching the goal.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 3.0),   # Move vertically upward, clearing obstacles 1 and 2
    (3.0, 3.0),   # Move rightwards, staying clear of obstacle 3
    (3.0, 3.5),   # Adjust slightly upwards to avoid obstacle 4
    (4.5, 3.5),   # Move rightwards towards the goal set
    (4.5, 4.5)   # Arrive at a point within the goal set
]
```

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:59:48 AM] The initial path attempts to move directly to the right from the starting point and then upwards to reach the goal. This causes collisions with Obstacles 3 and 4. 

To correct the path, let's analyze the environment:

1. **Obstacles 3 & 4:** These obstacles form a narrow corridor leading to the goal set. The initial path attempts to pass through this corridor too early and gets blocked.

2. **Vertical Clearance:** There's ample space above Obstacle 6 and below Obstacles 1 and 2. We can utilize this space to maneuver around Obstacles 3 and 4. 

Therefore, the new path should first navigate around Obstacles 3 and 4, either from above or below, before approaching the goal set.

Here's one possible solution:

**new_path =** 
```
[
  (0.5, 0.5),      # Start point
  (0.5, 6.0),      # Move upwards, clearing Obstacle 3
  (6.0, 6.0),      # Move rightwards, clearing Obstacle 4 
  (6.0, 4.5),      # Move downwards, aligning with the goal set
  (4.5, 4.5)       # Move leftwards into the goal set
] 
```

This path:

* **Starts** within the start set.
* **Avoids** all obstacles by maneuvering around Obstacles 3 and 4.
* **Ends** within the goal set.

[08/22/2024 12:00:26 PM] The original path attempts to move directly to the right from the starting position.  However, Obstacles 3 and 4 form a barrier in that direction. To circumvent this, we can adjust the path to first move upwards, then navigate to the right, going around Obstacle 3, before finally heading towards the goal.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start in the start set
    (0.5, 3.0),    # Move upwards to avoid the initial collision with Obstacle 3
    (0.5, 14.5),   # Continue upwards, clearing the top of Obstacle 3 
    (3.0, 14.5),   # Move rightwards, staying clear of Obstacle 3
    (3.0, 5.0),    # Move downwards, navigating between Obstacles 3 and 4
    (4.5, 5.0),    # Move rightwards towards the goal set
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Finally, move downwards to end within the goal set
