# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.75, 0.75], [0.25, 0.75], [0.25, 0.25], [0.75, 0.25]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.0, 0.0], [-2.0, 0.0], [-2.0, -2.0], [15.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.0, 15.0], [-2.0, 15.0], [-2.0, -0.0], [0.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[4.0, 14.0], [1.0, 14.0], [1.0, 1.0], [4.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 4: [[14.0, 4.0], [4.0, 4.0], [4.0, 1.0], [14.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 5: [[14.0, 10.0], [5.0, 10.0], [5.0, 4.0], [14.0, 4.0]]
			Obstacle 6: [[14.0, 14.0], [4.0, 14.0], [4.0, 11.0], [14.0, 11.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:40:29 AM] The provided environment features a channel-like path from the start to the goal, primarily constrained by obstacles 3 and 4. The strategy will be to navigate through this channel.

Here's a possible path:

```python
new_path = [
    (0.5,  0.5),   # Start at the center of the start zone
    (0.5,  1.5),   # Move up, clearing the corner of obstacle 3 
    (4.5,  1.5),   # Move right, staying within the channel 
    (4.5,  4.5)    # Move up into the goal zone 
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(0.5, 0.5):**  Starting in the middle of the start set.
2. **(0.5, 1.5):** Moving up slightly to avoid the corner of obstacle 3.
3. **(4.5, 1.5):**  Moving horizontally within the channel formed by obstacles 3 and 4. 
4. **(4.5, 4.5):**  Moving up into the center of the goal set. 

**Important Note:** This path avoids getting too close to the edges of the obstacles to account for potential uncertainties or slight variations in the environment.

[08/22/2024 11:40:38 AM] A viable path can be visualized by navigating above the obstacles 3 and 6, then maneuvering through the space between obstacles 5 and 6. 

new_path = [
    (0.5,  0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 14.5),    # Move upwards, staying clear above obstacle 3 
    (5.5, 14.5),    # Move rightwards, passing above obstacle 6
    (5.5,  9.5),    # Move downwards, navigating between obstacles 5 and 6
    (4.5,  4.5)     # Reach the goal within the goal set

[08/22/2024 11:41:19 AM] The initial path goes right through obstacles 3 and 4. To fix this, we can route the path above obstacle 6 and approach the goal from the top. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 15.0),  # Move upwards, clearing all obstacles
    (5.0, 15.0),  # Move rightwards, staying above obstacles 
    (5.0, 4.5)   # Move downwards to end within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(0.5, 0.5) -> (0.5, 15.0):** This segment moves the path vertically upwards, ensuring a safe distance from all obstacles.
2. **(0.5, 15.0) -> (5.0, 15.0):** This segment moves the path horizontally to the right, staying above all obstacles. 
3. **(5.0, 15.0) -> (5.0, 4.5):** This segment moves the path vertically downwards, directly into the goal set. 

This new path avoids all obstacles and successfully connects the start and goal sets.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements

    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.75, 0.75], [0.25, 0.75], [0.25, 0.25], [0.75, 0.25]]

[08/22/2024 11:41:24 AM] The initial path went straight upwards and then aimed for the goal. This resulted in a collision with obstacles 5 and 6. To avoid this, we can route the path to the right before moving upwards. 

Here's the updated path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start within the start set
    (3.5, 0.5),   # Move to the right, staying clear of the obstacles 
    (3.5, 15.0),  # Move upwards, clear of all obstacles
    (5.0, 15.0),  # Move right to align with the goal
    (5.0, 4.5)   # Move down into the goal set
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles by first moving to the right, then upwards, and finally towards the goal.

[08/22/2024 11:41:29 AM] The initial path has collisions because it goes directly south to north, intersecting with obstacles concentrated in the center of the environment. A better strategy is to navigate around these obstacles.

[08/22/2024 11:41:39 AM] The initial path was a good attempt, but it intersected with several obstacles. Let's analyze the environment and adjust the path:

1. **Segment 2 & 3:** The path tries to move directly upwards from (3.5, 0.5) to (3.5, 3.5). However, this line directly cuts through obstacle 3. We need to find a way around this obstacle. 

2. **Navigating around Obstacle 3:** We can go either left or right around obstacle 3. Going left seems easier since the path is already close to the left edge of the obstacle. We can add a waypoint at (0.5, 3.5) to navigate around obstacle 3.

3. **Segment 5:** This segment attempts to connect to the goal set from (15.0, 5.0). However, obstacle 5 sits directly between these points. 

4. **Reaching the Goal:** To avoid obstacle 5, we can reroute the path to go above it. Since we're already above obstacle 5 after navigating around obstacle 3, we can add waypoints to move directly to the goal set.

Therefore, the updated path should look like this:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start point
    (3.5, 0.5),  # Move right
    (3.5, 0.9),  # Move up close to obstacle 3
    (0.5, 0.9),  # Move left, clearing obstacle 3
    (0.5, 3.5),  # Move up, passing above obstacle 3
    (5.0, 3.5),  # Move right, towards the goal
    (5.0, 4.5)   # Move down, into the goal set
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles and successfully connects the start and goal sets.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data

### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:41:45 AM] The original path attempts to cross the obstacles horizontally. Analyzing the spatial relationships between the obstacles reveals a vertical corridor wide enough for the path to traverse.

1. **Starting Point:** (0.5, 0.5) - remains unchanged. 
2. **Navigating Vertically:** To reach the vertical corridor, the path needs to first move upwards, bypassing Obstacle 3. We can add waypoints (0.5, 2.5) to achieve this.
3. **Traversing the Corridor:**  From (0.5, 2.5), the path can safely move rightwards to (5.0, 2.5) staying clear of all obstacles.
4. **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, the path can move upwards from (5.0, 2.5) to (5.0, 4.5), successfully reaching the goal set.

**Therefore, a revised path that avoids all obstacles is:**

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 2.5), (5.0, 2.5), (5.0, 4.5)]
```

[08/22/2024 11:41:52 AM] The initial path goes directly towards the goal but intersects with obstacles 3, 4, and 5. To fix this, the path needs to navigate around these obstacles.

1. **Starting Point:** The initial starting point (0.5, 0.5) is fine.

2. **Navigating Obstacles:** 
    * Obstacles 3 and 4 form a narrow corridor. To avoid them, the path needs to move upwards before reaching obstacle 3 and then rightwards above obstacle 3.
    *  Obstacle 5 is to the right of obstacle 4, so the path needs to continue upwards above obstacle 5 before heading towards the goal.

3. **Reaching the Goal:** Once above obstacle 5, the path can safely move rightwards towards the goal.

Here's a possible revised path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),     // Start
    (0.5, 14.5),    // Move up above obstacles 3, 4, and 6
    (5.5, 14.5),    // Move right above obstacle 5
    (5.5, 4.5)     // Move down to the goal 
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles and successfully connects the start and goal sets.

First, the path needs to navigate around obstacles 3 and 4. Moving to (0.5, 14.5) still works to avoid these obstacles. Then, to avoid obstacles 5 and 6, the path can move right to a point with an x-coordinate greater than 14. Let's try (14.5, 14.5).

    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:42:16 AM] The current path goes too far to the right, causing it to intersect with obstacles 5 and 6. To avoid this, we can adjust the path to go upwards, then navigate between obstacles 3 and 6, before heading towards the goal. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 14.5),   # Move upwards, staying clear of obstacle 2
    (3.5, 14.5),   # Move right, staying clear of obstacle 6
    (3.5, 4.5),    # Move downwards, staying clear of obstacles 3 and 5

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:42:23 AM] The original path attempted to go above obstacles 3 and 6, but intersected with obstacle 3. To correct this, the path needs to move further to the right before descending to the goal.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),        # Start in the start set
    (0.5, 14.5),       # Move upwards, staying clear of obstacles 
    (14.5, 14.5),      # Move rightwards, clear of obstacle 6
    (14.5, 4.5),       # Move downwards, clear of obstacles 5 and 4
    (4.5, 4.5)         # Move leftwards to the goal 
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Move further right:** Instead of navigating close to obstacle 3, the path now goes all the way to the right edge (x=14.5) to completely avoid any potential conflicts. 
2. **Descend safely:** From the top right, the path descends along x=14.5, staying clear of obstacles 5 and 4.
3. **Final approach:** The path finally moves leftwards towards the goal position. 

This adjusted path ensures a safe and collision-free trajectory from the start to the goal set.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:42:32 AM] The issue is that the fourth segment cuts directly through obstacle 5. To fix this, we should route the path above obstacle 5.

Here's the updated path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),        # Start in the start set
    (0.5, 14.5),       # Move upwards, same as before
    (14.5, 14.5),      # Move rightwards, same as before 
    (14.5, 10.5),      # Move downwards to be above obstacle 5 
    (4.5, 10.5),       # Move leftwards to be above the goal
    (4.5, 4.5)        # Move downwards to the goal 
]
```

Here's the thought process:

1. **Identify the problem:** The feedback indicated that the segment between (14.5, 4.5) and (4.5, 4.5) intersects with obstacle 5.
2. **Analyze the environment:**  Obstacle 5 occupies the space between y-coordinates 4 and 10. 
3. **Find a solution:** To avoid obstacle 5, the path needs to go above it (y > 10). 
4. **Adjust the path:**
    -  Add a waypoint at (14.5, 10.5) to route the path above obstacle 5. 
    - Add a waypoint at (4.5, 10.5) to move leftwards and align with the goal.
    - Keep the final waypoint at (4.5, 4.5) to reach the goal.
