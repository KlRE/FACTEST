# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.75, 0.75], [0.25, 0.75], [0.25, 0.25], [0.75, 0.25]]

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.0, 0.0], [-2.0, 0.0], [-2.0, -2.0], [15.0, -2.0]]

]

[08/22/2024 11:30:06 AM] The original path went too far to the right and encountered obstacles. Instead, we can navigate a path directly to the goal set by staying to the left of obstacles 3, 4, 5, and 6.

Here's the updated path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 3.5),    # Move upwards, staying left of obstacles 3 and 4
    (3.5, 3.5),    # Move right, staying below obstacle 5
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Move directly into the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(0.5, 0.5) to (0.5, 3.5):**  This movement goes straight up, staying clear to the left of obstacles 3 and 4. 
2. **(0.5, 3.5) to (3.5, 3.5):** This moves rightward, staying below the bottom edge of obstacle 5. 
3. **(3.5, 3.5) to (4.5, 4.5):**  This final movement goes directly right and slightly up into the center of the goal set.

[08/22/2024 11:30:11 AM] The initial path goes directly through obstacles 3 and 4. To fix this, the path needs to be adjusted to navigate around these obstacles. 

There's a clear path upwards that is not blocked by any obstacles. The path can first proceed upwards to a y-coordinate greater than the obstacles, then move towards the goal. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 15.0),   # Move upwards, exceeding the y-coordinate of the highest obstacle
    (5.0, 15.0),   # Move rightwards, aligning with the goal's x-coordinate

        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:30:17 AM] The initial path went straight from (5.0, 15.0) to (5.0, 4.5), directly through obstacles 5 and 6. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around these obstacles. 

Looking at the obstacle coordinates, we can see that obstacle 5 occupies the x-range of 5.0 to 14.0 and the y-range of 4.0 to 10.0. Obstacle 6 occupies the x-range of 4.0 to 14.0 and the y-range of 11.0 to 14.0. 

Therefore, we can navigate around these obstacles by moving to an x-coordinate less than 4.0 before descending.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 15.0), 
    (3.5, 15.0),  # Move left to x = 3.5, clearing obstacle 6
    (3.5, 4.5)   # Now descend safely to the goal area
]
```

    End set: Incorrect, The path does not end inside the goal set [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]].

[08/22/2024 11:30:22 AM] The previous path went too far to the right and got stuck behind obstacle 3. It also didn't reach the goal set.

To correct this, the path needs to stay closer to the obstacle 2 to avoid obstacle 3 altogether. Then, it can move towards the goal set safely.

Here's a possible corrected path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 13.0),  # Move upwards, staying clear of obstacle 2
    (5.5, 13.0),  # Move right, staying clear of obstacle 6

[08/22/2024 11:30:28 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate above obstacles 3 and 6. However, the chosen y-coordinate (y = 13) leads to collisions. To rectify this, we'll adjust the path to navigate between obstacles, ensuring a safe distance.

1. **Starting Point:** We'll maintain the initial starting point (0.5, 0.5).

2. **Navigating Obstacles:**  Instead of going above obstacles 3 and 6, we'll direct the path between obstacles 3 and 4. To do this, we'll introduce a waypoint to the right of obstacle 3 at (4.5, 8). 

3. **Reaching the Goal:** From (4.5, 8), we can directly move down to the goal position (4.5, 4.5).

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

[08/22/2024 11:30:33 AM] The original path intersects with Obstacle 3 because it attempts to go directly to the goal through a blocked area.  We need to find a way around this obstacle.

1. **Navigate above Obstacle 3:** Instead of going directly towards the goal, the path needs to initially head upwards to bypass Obstacle 3, which extends upwards to y=14.

2. **Clearance from Obstacle 3:** To ensure the path avoids Obstacle 3, we need to route it above the obstacle's top edge (y=14).

3. **Approach the Goal:** Once clear of Obstacle 3, the path can then proceed towards the goal.

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Starting point

## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.75, 0.75], [0.25, 0.75], [0.25, 0.25], [0.75, 0.25]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.0, 0.0], [-2.0, 0.0], [-2.0, -2.0], [15.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.0, 15.0], [-2.0, 15.0], [-2.0, -0.0], [0.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[4.0, 14.0], [1.0, 14.0], [1.0, 1.0], [4.0, 1.0]]

			Obstacle 5: [[14.0, 10.0], [5.0, 10.0], [5.0, 4.0], [14.0, 4.0]]
			Obstacle 6: [[14.0, 14.0], [4.0, 14.0], [4.0, 11.0], [14.0, 11.0]]

    
## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 14.5), (4.5, 14.5), (4.5, 4.5)]

## Feedback

		Segment 3 between points (4.5, 14.5) and (4.5, 4.5) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 6: [[14.0, 14.0], [4.0, 14.0], [4.0, 11.0], [14.0, 11.0]]
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.

    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:30:41 AM] The initial path was trying to move directly upwards and then rightwards. However, Obstacle 6 is blocking the direct path downwards. To avoid this, the path needs to move further right before going down.

Here's how the path can be adjusted:

1. **Start:** Same as before, start inside the start set at (0.5, 0.5).
2. **Move Upwards:** Move upwards to clear the obstacles, reaching (0.5, 14.5).
3. **Move Right:** Move rightwards, going past Obstacle 6, reaching (14.5, 14.5). 
4. **Move Downwards:** Now clear of Obstacle 6, move downwards towards the goal, reaching (14.5, 4.5).
5. **Move Left:** Finally, move left towards the goal, ending at (4.5, 4.5).

**New Path:**
```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 14.5), 
    (14.5, 14.5),
    (14.5, 4.5),
    (4.5, 4.5)
]

[08/22/2024 11:31:20 AM] The issue is that the current path cuts directly through obstacle 5. To fix this, we need to route the path around it. One way to do this is to go "south" of obstacle 5.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start in the start set
    (0.5, 14.5),   # Move up clearing obstacles
    (14.5, 14.5),  # Move right, still clearing obstacles 
    (14.5, 3.5),  # Move down, staying clear of obstacle 5
    (4.5, 3.5),   # Move left, towards the goal 
    (4.5, 4.5)    # Finish in the goal set 
]
```

Here's why this works:

1. **Starting Point:** We begin within the start set.
2. **Up and Over:**  The first two waypoints move the path up and to the right, completely avoiding obstacles 1, 2, 3, and 6.
3. **Going South:** Instead of going directly left at y=4.5 and intersecting obstacle 5, we move down to y=3.5. This keeps the path clear of obstacle 5's lower boundary.
4. **Approaching the Goal:** We are now free to move left and directly into the goal set. 

This new path successfully navigates the obstacles and reaches the goal!

[08/22/2024 11:31:25 AM] The original path's segments 4 and 5 are intersecting with obstacle 4. To avoid this, we can adjust the path to go around obstacle 4. 

1. **Going Above:** Instead of going through the middle, the path can be adjusted to move above obstacle 4.

2. **Adjusting Waypoints:** This requires adding a waypoint to navigate around the obstacle.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 14.5), (14.5, 14.5), (14.5, 5.5), (4.5, 5.5), (4.5, 4.5)]
```

This path first moves to a point above obstacle 4, and then proceeds towards the goal. This avoids any intersection with obstacle 4.

    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:31:32 AM] The feedback correctly points out that the path segment from (14.5, 5.5) to (4.5, 5.5) cuts through obstacle 5. To rectify this, we need to route the path around this obstacle. 

Since the path is already clear to (14.5, 5.5), let's add a waypoint further down to go around obstacle 5. We can achieve this by moving to (14.5, 3.5), safely below obstacle 5. From there, we can proceed horizontally to (4.5, 3.5), bypassing obstacle 5 entirely.  Finally, we move upwards to (4.5, 4.5) to reach the goal set.

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 14.5), 
    (14.5, 14.5), 
    (14.5, 5.5), 
    (14.5, 3.5),  # Move down to clear obstacle 5
    (4.5, 3.5),   # Move horizontally towards the goal
    (4.5, 4.5)    # Move up into the goal set
]
```

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

[08/22/2024 11:31:39 AM] The original path attempts to navigate above obstacles 3, 4, and 5, then move left towards the goal. However, segment 5 crosses obstacle 4. 

To avoid this, we can adjust the path to go below obstacle 4 instead of above. This can be achieved by adding a waypoint to the right of obstacles 4 and 5 before moving up towards the goal.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 14.5), 
    (14.5, 14.5), 
    (14.5, 5.5),

    (4.5, 0.5),   # Move left towards the goal
    (4.5, 4.5) 
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles and successfully reaches the goal.

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

]

[08/22/2024 11:31:46 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 4.  Instead of going straight up to (4.5, 4.5), the path needs to navigate around the obstacle.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),        # Start in the start set
    (0.5, 14.5),       # Move upwards 
    (14.5, 14.5),      # Move right
    (14.5, 5.5),      # Move down 
    (14.5, 0.5),      # Move down again
    (3.5, 0.5),        # Move left, staying below Obstacle 4
    (3.5, 4.5)         # Move up to the goal set
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Stay Low:** Instead of moving directly to (4.5, 4.5), the path now moves leftwards along the bottom edge of Obstacle 4 by going to (3.5, 0.5). 
2. **Vertical Approach:** From (3.5, 0.5), the path goes straight up to (3.5, 4.5), reaching the goal set without crossing any obstacles. 

This adjusted path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

[08/22/2024 11:31:50 AM] The previous path went too far down and tried to move upwards to the goal, leading to a collision. 

The new path will instead aim to go around the obstacles entirely by moving above them and approaching the goal from the top.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.75, 0.75], [0.25, 0.75], [0.25, 0.25], [0.75, 0.25]]

			Obstacle 5: [[14.0, 10.0], [5.0, 10.0], [5.0, 4.0], [14.0, 4.0]]
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.

[08/22/2024 11:32:29 AM] The initial path went directly over Obstacle 5. To correct this, the path should be adjusted to navigate around this obstacle. 

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Maintain the first three waypoints:** The first three segments are valid and don't intersect any obstacles. 
2. **Navigate below Obstacle 5:**  Instead of going directly to (14.5, 4.5), move to a point below Obstacle 5, such as (14.5, 2.5).
3. **Move towards the goal:** Finally, proceed to the goal position at (4.5, 4.5).

Therefore, a corrected path could be:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 14.5), 
    (14.5, 14.5), 
    (14.5, 2.5),  # Go below Obstacle 5

[08/22/2024 11:32:40 AM] The original path goes too far to the right, causing the collision with obstacles 4 and 5. We should try going around the left side of the obstacles instead.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start in the start set
    (0.5, 3.5),   # Move upwards to avoid obstacle 3 
    (3.5, 3.5),   # Move rightwards, staying clear of obstacle 3
    (3.5, 14.5),  # Move upwards, avoiding obstacles 4 and 5
    (14.5, 14.5), # Move rightwards
    (14.5, 2.5),  # Move downwards
    (4.5, 4.5)    # Move to the goal within the goal set
]
```

Here's the thought process:

1. **Start:** We begin at (0.5, 0.5), safely within the start set.
2. **Go Up:** Move upwards to (0.5, 3.5), giving a safe distance from obstacle 3.
3. **Head Right:**  Move right to (3.5, 3.5), staying clear of obstacle 3's right edge.
4. **Go Up Again:** Move upwards to (3.5, 14.5), safely navigating around obstacles 4 and 5. 
5. **Right to the Edge:** Move right to (14.5, 14.5), staying clear of obstacle 6.
6. **Down to the Goal:** Move down to (14.5, 2.5), then directly left to the goal at (4.5, 4.5).

This path avoids all obstacles by maintaining a safe distance and navigating around their edges.

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[08/22/2024 11:32:48 AM] The initial path has several intersections with obstacles. Let's analyze and correct them:

1. **Segment 2 ((0.5, 3.5) - (3.5, 3.5)) & Segment 3 ((3.5, 3.5) - (3.5, 14.5))**: These segments directly cut through Obstacle 3. To avoid this, we can route the path above Obstacle 3. 
2. **Segment 6 ((14.5, 2.5) - (4.5, 4.5))**: This segment intersects both Obstacle 4 and Obstacle 5. We need to find a way around these obstacles to reach the goal.

Considering these points, a modified path could be:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start point
    (0.5, 14.5),  # Move above all obstacles 
    (14.5, 14.5), # Move right, staying above obstacles
    (14.5, 4.5),  # Move down, clear of Obstacle 5 
    (4.5, 4.5)    # Reach the goal
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles:

* It starts within the start set.
* It navigates above Obstacle 3, avoiding the initial intersections.
* By staying at a high y-coordinate, it avoids Obstacles 4 and 5.
* Finally, it moves down to the goal set without crossing any obstacles.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.75, 0.75], [0.25, 0.75], [0.25, 0.25], [0.75, 0.25]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.0, 0.0], [-2.0, 0.0], [-2.0, -2.0], [15.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.0, 15.0], [-2.0, 15.0], [-2.0, -0.0], [0.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[4.0, 14.0], [1.0, 14.0], [1.0, 1.0], [4.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 4: [[14.0, 4.0], [4.0, 4.0], [4.0, 1.0], [14.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 5: [[14.0, 10.0], [5.0, 10.0], [5.0, 4.0], [14.0, 4.0]]
			Obstacle 6: [[14.0, 14.0], [4.0, 14.0], [4.0, 11.0], [14.0, 11.0]]

    
## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 14.5), (14.5, 14.5), (14.5, 4.5), (4.5, 4.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    Obstacle Avoidance (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
		Segment 4 between points (14.5, 4.5) and (4.5, 4.5) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 5: [[14.0, 10.0], [5.0, 10.0], [5.0, 4.0], [14.0, 4.0]]
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:32:53 AM] The previous path was intersecting with Obstacle 5 because it was attempting to move directly horizontally. 
To fix this, the path needs to navigate above Obstacle 5. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),        # Start in the start set
    (0.5, 14.5),       # Move upwards, same as before 
    (14.5, 14.5),      # Move right, same as before
    (14.5, 10.5),      # Move down to clear Obstacle 5, adding 0.5 to the y-coordinate of the obstacle's top edge 
    (4.5, 10.5),       # Move left, clearing Obstacle 5
    (4.5, 4.5)        # Move down to the goal
] 
```

This path avoids Obstacle 5 by going around its top edge, ensuring no intersection.
