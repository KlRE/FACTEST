# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.75, 0.75], [0.25, 0.75], [0.25, 0.25], [0.75, 0.25]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.0, 0.0], [-2.0, 0.0], [-2.0, -2.0], [15.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.0, 15.0], [-2.0, 15.0], [-2.0, -0.0], [0.0, -0.0]]

[08/22/2024 11:37:19 AM] It's great to see you're thinking about motion planning! Visualizing the environment is key to solving this. Let's break down a possible path:

**Analysis:**

* **Starting Point:** We can start near the middle of the start set at (0.5, 0.5).
* **Initial Maneuver:**  Notice there's space between Obstacles 2 and 3. We need to head north to get there.
* **Navigating the Obstacles:**  
    * We'll have to navigate around Obstacle 3 to the right.  
    * Obstacles 5 and 6 form a corridor we can travel through.
* **Final Approach:**  Once we're past Obstacle 6, it's a clear shot to the goal.

**Proposed Path (`new_path`):**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start
    (0.5, 1.5),    # Move up, avoiding Obstacle 2
    (3.5, 1.5),    # Move right, staying below Obstacle 3
    (3.5, 7.0),    # Move up, entering the corridor 
    (8.0, 7.0),    # Move right, staying within the corridor
    (8.0, 4.5),    # Move down, clearing Obstacle 6
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Move right, reaching the goal set 
]
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Visualization:** It's crucial to draw the start, goal, and obstacles to scale on a grid to verify this path.
* **Clearance:**  The path I provided assumes some clearance from the obstacles. Adjust the waypoints slightly if you need more buffer.
* **Optimality:** This path is not necessarily the shortest or fastest.  Motion planning algorithms are designed to find more optimal solutions. 

Let me know if you want to explore other path options or have any more motion planning scenarios!

## Example

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:37:28 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate directly towards the goal, but runs into multiple obstacles. 

1. **Navigating Obstacle 3:** The path needs to completely avoid Obstacle 3. It's most efficient to move above it.
2. **Clearance for Obstacle 5:**  The path also needs to steer clear of Obstacle 5. 

Considering these factors, here's a possible revised path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),     // Start within the start set
    (0.5, 2.0),     // Move upwards, clearing Obstacle 3
    (3.0, 2.0),     // Move rightwards, staying below Obstacle 3
    (3.0, 8.0),     // Move upwards, clearing Obstacle 3 and 5
    (8.0, 8.0),     // Move rightwards, staying above Obstacle 5
    (8.0, 4.5),     // Move downwards towards the goal set
    (4.5, 4.5)      // End within the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

* **Initial Upward Movement:** The path first moves upwards to `(0.5, 2.0)` to clear the top left corner of Obstacle 3.
* **Lateral Movement and Obstacle 5 Clearance:** The path then moves rightwards to `(3.0, 2.0)`, staying below Obstacle 3. To avoid Obstacle 5, it moves significantly upwards to  `(3.0, 8.0)`, providing a safe margin.
* **Final Approach:** From there, the path can safely move rightwards to `(8.0, 8.0)`, then downwards towards the goal, bypassing Obstacle 5.

]

[08/22/2024 11:37:36 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate directly to the goal but encounters multiple obstacle collisions. To rectify this, a new strategy is required.

1. **Initial Path Analysis:** The provided path collides with obstacles primarily due to its directness.  It needs to navigate around obstacles 3 and 5. 

2. **Identifying Safe Zones:** There's a clear vertical corridor between obstacles 3 and 5. The path should leverage this corridor.

3. **Waypoint Adjustment:**

    - From the start point (0.5, 0.5), move vertically upwards to a y-coordinate above obstacle 3 (e.g., y = 14.5). 
    - Then, proceed horizontally to the right, aligning with the x-coordinate of the goal region (e.g., x = 4.5).
    - Finally, move vertically downwards to reach a point within the goal set (4.5, 4.5).

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   // Start Point
    (0.5, 14.5),  // Move above Obstacle 3
    (4.5, 14.5),  // Move horizontally to align with the goal
    (4.5, 4.5)   // Move down into the goal set

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.75, 0.75], [0.25, 0.75], [0.25, 0.25], [0.75, 0.25]]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[08/22/2024 11:37:40 AM] The initial path went right through Obstacle 6. To avoid this, we can route the path around the left side of the obstacle. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start in the start set
    (0.5, 14.5),  # Move upwards, staying clear of obstacles
    (3.5, 14.5),  # Move rightwards, staying above obstacle 6
    (3.5, 4.5),    # Move downwards, clear of all obstacles

[08/22/2024 11:37:50 AM] The initial path went right through obstacle 3. To correct this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle. 

Since the initial path already goes above obstacle 3 with the point (2.0, 14.5), we can adjust the path to move directly from the start point to this point above the obstacles. Then, we can proceed to the end goal.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   // Starting point
    (2.0, 14.5),  // Move above all obstacles 
    (4.5, 14.5),  // Move horizontally towards the goal
    (4.5, 4.5)   // Move down to the center of the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:38:22 AM] The original path fails because it intersects with obstacles 3 and 6. 

To address this, we can adjust the path as follows:

1. **Navigate above obstacle 3**: Instead of going directly from the start point towards the goal, we can first move upwards, clearing obstacle 3, before proceeding rightwards. 
2. **Navigate around obstacle 6**: After clearing obstacle 3, we can continue rightwards, staying above obstacle 6,  before finally descending to the goal. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),       // Start point
    (0.5, 15.0),      // Move upwards, clearing obstacle 3
    (4.5, 15.0),      // Move rightwards, staying clear of obstacle 6
    (4.5, 4.5)       // Move downwards to the goal point 
]
```

This new path avoids all obstacles while successfully connecting the start and goal regions.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.

[08/22/2024 11:38:28 AM] The previous path attempt failed because it tried to cross directly through the space between obstacles 5 and 6. To fix this, the path needs to navigate around these obstacles. One approach is to route the path above obstacle 6. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set.
    (0.5, 15.0),   # Move vertically upward, staying clear of obstacle 2.
    (5.5, 15.0),   # Move horizontally to the right, staying above obstacle 6. 
    (5.5, 4.5),    # Move vertically downward to align with the goal set.
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Move horizontally to the left to reach the goal set.
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles:

* It starts within the start set.
* It moves vertically above obstacle 2.
* It stays above obstacle 6 by moving to x = 5.5 before descending.
* Finally, it reaches the goal set without intersecting any obstacles.

    (4.5, 4.5)         # Arrive at the center of the goal area 
]

This path first goes around the obstacle field to the right, then drops down south of Obstacle 5, and finally moves left to the goal. This avoids crossing any obstacles.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.75, 0.75], [0.25, 0.75], [0.25, 0.25], [0.75, 0.25]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.0, 0.0], [-2.0, 0.0], [-2.0, -2.0], [15.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.0, 15.0], [-2.0, 15.0], [-2.0, -0.0], [0.0, -0.0]]

		Segment 4 between points (15.0, 3.5) and (4.5, 3.5) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 4: [[14.0, 4.0], [4.0, 4.0], [4.0, 1.0], [14.0, 1.0]]
		Segment 5 between points (4.5, 3.5) and (4.5, 4.5) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 4: [[14.0, 4.0], [4.0, 4.0], [4.0, 1.0], [14.0, 1.0]]
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:38:48 AM] The original path collides with Obstacle 4 because it attempts to move directly from right to left at a y-coordinate of 3.5. To avoid this, we need to route the path around the top of Obstacle 4.  We can achieve this by adding a waypoint above Obstacle 4 before heading towards the goal.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),      # Start in the start set
    (0.5, 15.0),     # Move upwards, same as before
    (15.0, 15.0),    # Move right, same as before
    (15.0, 5.0),     # Move downwards, going above Obstacle 4 
    (4.5, 5.0),      # Move left towards the goal
    (4.5, 4.5)       # Move down into the goal set 
]
``` 
 
This new path avoids all obstacles:

* It starts within the start set.
* It navigates to a point above Obstacle 4. 
* It then proceeds leftward, clearing the obstacle.
* Finally, it descends into the goal set.

[08/22/2024 11:38:56 AM] The issue is with the segment connecting (15.0, 5.0) to (4.5, 5.0) as it attempts to cut through Obstacle 5. We need to route the path around this obstacle. 

Here's how we can adjust the path:

1. **From the previous waypoint (15.0, 15.0):** Instead of going directly to (15.0, 5.0), we can move downwards to (15.0, 3.0), staying clear of Obstacle 5.
2. **Navigate to the goal:** From (15.0, 3.0), we can move leftwards to (4.5, 3.0) and finally upwards to (4.5, 4.5) to reach the goal set. 

This avoids all obstacles while still maintaining a valid path.

Here's the corrected path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 15.0), 
    (15.0, 15.0), 
    (15.0, 3.0), # Move down, clearing Obstacle 5

[08/22/2024 11:39:24 AM] The original path's segments 4 and 5 are intersecting obstacles, so we need to adjust those. 

- The path currently goes from (15.0, 15.0) to (15.0, 3.0) to (4.5, 3.0). This takes it directly through obstacles 5 and 4. 
- Instead, we can route it around the bottom of obstacle 4. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 15.0), 
    (15.0, 15.0),

    (4.5, 0.0),   # Move towards the goal
    (4.5, 4.5)    # End in the goal set 
]
```

This new path avoids all obstacles:

1. **(0.5, 0.5) to (0.5, 15.0)**: Moves straight up, clear of any obstacles.
2. **(0.5, 15.0) to (15.0, 15.0)**: Moves straight right, clear above all obstacles.
3. **(15.0, 15.0) to (15.0, 0.0)**: Moves straight down, clear to the right of all obstacles.
4. **(15.0, 0.0) to (4.5, 0.0)**: Moves straight left, clear below all obstacles.

[08/22/2024 11:39:29 AM] The initial path went too far to the right, leading to collisions with obstacles. It's better to navigate above the obstacles and then approach the goal.

Here's a revised path:

1. **Start:** (0.5, 0.5) - Same as before, within the start set.
2. **Up and Clear:** (0.5, 15.5) - Move directly upwards, staying clear of Obstacles 2 and 3. Adding 0.5 to the y-coordinate ensures staying clear of the obstacles.
3. **Navigate Right:** (4.5, 15.5) -  Move horizontally, staying above Obstacles 5 and 6.
4. **Descend to Goal:** (4.5, 4.5) - Move directly downwards into the goal set.

**New Path:**
```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 15.5), (4.5, 15.5), (4.5, 4.5)]

[08/22/2024 11:39:35 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 6. To do this, we can add a waypoint to the right of Obstacle 6, allowing the path to go around it.

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 15.5),

    (4.5, 4.5)

This path first moves up and to the right as before, clearing Obstacles 2 and 3. Then, it continues right, moving to the far side of Obstacle 6.  Finally, it moves down to the goal, avoiding all obstacles.

[08/22/2024 11:39:43 AM] The original path collides with obstacle 5 because it tries to move directly horizontally from (15.5, 4.5) to (4.5, 4.5). To avoid this, we need to route the path above obstacle 5.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start in the start set
    (0.5, 15.5),  # Move upwards, same as before
    (15.5, 15.5), # Move rightwards, same as before
    (15.5, 11.5), # Move downwards to be above Obstacle 5
    (4.5, 11.5),  # Move leftwards to clear Obstacle 5
    (4.5, 4.5)   # Move downwards to end in the goal set 
]
```

This path first replicates the initial movements of the original path.  It then adds two waypoints to navigate around obstacle 5. It moves south to (15.5, 11.5), ensuring it's above obstacle 5, then goes west to (4.5, 11.5), clearing obstacle 5, and finally descends to the goal.

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

[08/22/2024 11:39:52 AM] The initial path collides with Obstacle 6 because it attempts to cross directly from right to left at a y-coordinate of 11.5, which intersects the obstacle. To avoid this, we need to route the path around Obstacle 6.

Here's how we can adjust the path:

1. **Maintain the initial segments:** The first three segments,  [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 15.5), (15.5, 15.5)], are fine as they successfully navigate around the initial obstacles. 

2. **Navigate below Obstacle 6:** Instead of attempting to cross at y=11.5, let's route the path below Obstacle 6.  We can modify the fourth waypoint to  (15.5, 3.5) ensuring we're safely below the obstacle.

3. **Proceed towards the goal:** From (15.5, 3.5), we can safely move horizontally to (4.5, 3.5), which positions us directly above the goal set.

4. **Descend to the goal:** Finally, move down from (4.5, 3.5) to (4.5, 4.5), placing us within the goal set.

Therefore, the corrected path is:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 15.5), (15.5, 15.5), (15.5, 3.5), (4.5, 3.5), (4.5, 4.5)]

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

[08/22/2024 11:40:00 AM] The original path collides with Obstacle 4 due to the segment directly connecting (15.5, 3.5) and (4.5, 3.5). To rectify this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle. 

Observing the environment, we can route the path above Obstacle 4 by making the following changes:

1. **After reaching (15.5, 3.5), move upwards to a y-coordinate greater than 4.0 (the upper bound of Obstacle 4).** For this, let's choose (15.5, 4.5).
2. **From (15.5, 4.5), move leftwards towards the goal, passing above Obstacle 4.** This leads to the waypoint (4.5, 4.5).

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 15.5), (15.5, 15.5), (15.5, 3.5), (15.5, 4.5), (4.5, 4.5)]

[08/22/2024 11:40:08 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 5.  We can achieve this by routing the path above Obstacle 5. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),     # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 15.5),    # Move upwards, same as before
    (15.5, 15.5),   # Move rightwards, same as before
    (15.5, 11.5),   # Move downwards to a point above Obstacle 5 
    (4.5, 11.5),    # Move leftwards to a point above the goal set
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Move downwards into the goal set
]
```

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Identify the problem:** The original path intersected with Obstacle 5.
2. **Analyze the environment:**  Observe that there's free space above Obstacle 5.
3. **Adjust the path:**
    -  Instead of going directly to  (15.5, 3.5), move to (15.5, 11.5), a point above Obstacle 5.
    -  From there, move horizontally left to (4.5, 11.5), a point directly above the goal position.
    - Finally, move downwards to the goal position (4.5, 4.5).

This adjusted path avoids all obstacles and successfully connects the start and goal sets.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.75, 0.75], [0.25, 0.75], [0.25, 0.25], [0.75, 0.25]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.0, 0.0], [-2.0, 0.0], [-2.0, -2.0], [15.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.0, 15.0], [-2.0, 15.0], [-2.0, -0.0], [0.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[4.0, 14.0], [1.0, 14.0], [1.0, 1.0], [4.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 4: [[14.0, 4.0], [4.0, 4.0], [4.0, 1.0], [14.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 5: [[14.0, 10.0], [5.0, 10.0], [5.0, 4.0], [14.0, 4.0]]
			Obstacle 6: [[14.0, 14.0], [4.0, 14.0], [4.0, 11.0], [14.0, 11.0]]

    
## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 15.5), (15.5, 15.5), (15.5, 11.5), (15.5, 4.5), (4.5, 4.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    Obstacle Avoidance (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
		Segment 5 between points (15.5, 4.5) and (4.5, 4.5) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 5: [[14.0, 10.0], [5.0, 10.0], [5.0, 4.0], [14.0, 4.0]]
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:40:21 AM] The feedback correctly points out that the path segment between (15.5, 4.5) and (4.5, 4.5) intersects with Obstacle 5. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around Obstacle 5.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),        # Start in the start set.
    (0.5, 15.5),       # Move upwards, same as before.
    (15.5, 15.5),      # Move rightwards, same as before.
    (15.5, 11.5),      # Move downwards, same as before.
    (15.5, 3.5),       # Move downwards further to be below Obstacle 5.
    (4.5, 3.5),        # Move leftwards to the goal's x-coordinate.
    (4.5, 4.5)         # Move upwards to end in the goal set.
]
```

Here's the thought process behind these changes:

1. **Identify the Problem:** The path segment from (15.5, 4.5) to (4.5, 4.5) directly cuts through Obstacle 5.
2. **Analyze the Obstacle:** Obstacle 5 occupies the y-coordinate range roughly from 4.0 to 10.0.
3. **Find a Way Around:**  
    -  The path can move below Obstacle 5 by going down to a y-coordinate less than 4.0.
    - After clearing Obstacle 5, the path can move leftwards to reach the goal.

This new path avoids Obstacle 5 by going around it, thus satisfying the obstacle avoidance requirement.
