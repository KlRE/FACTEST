# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.75, 0.75], [0.25, 0.75], [0.25, 0.25], [0.75, 0.25]]

]

[08/22/2024 11:54:53 AM] The previous path attempt failed because it collided with obstacles 5 and 6 while trying to move directly downwards. To correct this, the path needs to navigate around these obstacles. 

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Start:** Keep the starting point at (0.5, 0.5).
2. **Move Upwards:**  Keep the upward movement to (0.5, 15.5) as it avoids the initial obstacles.
3. **Navigate Right:** Continue moving right to (5.5, 15.5) staying clear of obstacles.
4. **Descend Carefully:** Instead of going directly down,  move downwards to a point just above obstacle 6, for instance, (5.5, 10.5). 
5. **Go Around:** Move right to bypass obstacle 6 completely, reaching a point like (14.5, 10.5). 
6. **Descend Again:** Now safely move down to (14.5, 4.5), clearing all obstacles.
7. **Reach the Goal:** Finally, move left to a point within the goal set, for example, (4.5, 4.5).

Therefore, the corrected path is:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 15.5), (5.5, 15.5), (5.5, 10.5), (14.5, 10.5), (14.5, 4.5), (4.5, 4.5)]

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:55:02 AM] The path has issues with obstacle avoidance at two segments. Let's analyze and fix them:

1. **Segment 3: (5.5, 15.5) to (5.5, 10.5)** 
    - This segment cuts through the top right corner of Obstacle 6.  
    - Instead of going straight down, we can route the path around the obstacle. 

2. **Segment 6: (14.5, 4.5) to (4.5, 4.5)**
    - This segment cuts through Obstacle 5. 
    -  We can route the path to go above Obstacle 5.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),        # Start
    (0.5, 15.5),       # Move up
    (5.5, 15.5),       # Move right 
    (5.5, 11.5),       # Move down, clearing Obstacle 6 
    (14.5, 11.5),      # Move right, staying clear of Obstacle 6
    (14.5, 4.5),      # Move down
    (4.5, 4.5)         # Move left to the goal 
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

- We added a waypoint at (5.5, 11.5) to guide the path around Obstacle 6.
- We adjusted the path to move to (14.5, 11.5) before moving down, ensuring a safe distance from Obstacle 6. 
-  This new path avoids all obstacles and successfully connects the start and goal sets.

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:55:10 AM] The provided path attempts to navigate around the obstacles but fails due to intersections with obstacle 6 and 5. We need to adjust the path to avoid these intersections.

1. **Segment 3 & 4:** The path intersects with obstacle 6 because it tries to move directly downwards at x=5.5. To avoid this, we can route the path to the right of obstacle 6. 

2. **Segment 6:**  The path intersects obstacle 5 because it tries to move directly leftwards at y=4.5. We can avoid this by routing the path above obstacle 5.

Considering these adjustments, a possible new path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 15.5), 
    (15.5, 15.5),  # Move to the right of obstacle 6
    (15.5, 10.5),  # Move down to a point above obstacle 5
    (14.5, 10.5),
    (14.5, 4.5), 
    (4.5, 4.5)
]
```

This path first moves to a position to the right and clear of obstacle 6, then goes down to a point above obstacle 5 before proceeding to the goal. This avoids all intersections with obstacles.

[08/22/2024 11:55:16 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 5. To achieve this, we can modify the segment between (14.5, 10.5) and (14.5, 4.5) to go around the obstacle. 

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Identify the safe passage**: There's a clear path below Obstacle 5.
2. **Adjust the path**: Instead of going straight down from (14.5, 10.5),  we can route the path downwards to the right of the obstacle. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```

    (0.5, 15.5),

[08/22/2024 11:55:24 AM] The problem is with segments 6 and 7 which attempt to cross obstacle 4. To fix this, the path needs to navigate around obstacle 4. 

Here's an updated path:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 15.5), (15.5, 15.5), (15.5, 10.5), (14.5, 10.5), (14.5, 3.5), (15.5, 3.5), (15.5, 0.5), (4.5, 0.5),  (4.5, 4.5)] 
```

Here's the thought process behind the changes:

1. **Identify the problem:** Segments 6 and 7 of the original path collide with Obstacle 4.
2. **Analyze the environment:** Obstacle 4 sits to the right of the goal set, with a clear path above and below it.
3. **Choose a detour:** Since the original path approaches the goal set from above, we'll choose to route the path around the bottom of Obstacle 4.
4. **Add waypoints:** 
    - Add a waypoint to move further right, clearing Obstacle 4: (15.5, 3.5)
    - Add a waypoint to move down, staying clear of Obstacle 4: (15.5, 0.5)
    - Add a waypoint to move left, towards the goal set: (4.5, 0.5)

This new path avoids all obstacles while successfully connecting the start and goal sets.

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:55:34 AM] The issue is the final approach to the goal set. The path tries to go around obstacle 4 on the right, but the final segment crosses the obstacle. 

Instead of going around the right side of obstacle 4, the path can be adjusted to go around the left side.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 15.5), (15.5, 15.5), (15.5, 10.5), (14.5, 10.5), (14.5, 3.5), (13.5, 3.5), (13.5, 0.5), (4.5, 0.5), (4.5, 4.5)]
```

Here's the breakdown of the changes and the reasoning:

1. **Original path up to (14.5, 3.5) remains the same.** This part successfully navigates around the first set of obstacles.
2. **Instead of moving further right to (15.5, 3.5), we move left to (13.5, 3.5).** This positions the path to the left of obstacle 4.
3. **Continue along the left side of obstacle 4 with (13.5, 0.5).** This avoids crossing any part of the obstacle.
4. **The rest of the path to the goal remains the same: (4.5, 0.5), (4.5, 4.5).**  This final segment is now clear of obstacles.

By making this adjustment, the path successfully avoids all obstacles and reaches the goal set.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

[08/22/2024 11:55:42 AM] The initial path went too far south and attempted to weave between obstacles too close to the goal.  Instead, the path should remain north of Obstacles 4, 5, and 6. 

- From the starting point (0.5, 0.5), the path correctly moves to (0.5, 15.5), successfully avoiding Obstacle 2.  
- Next, (15.5, 15.5) is also correct, continuing to move above all obstacles. 
- At (15.5, 10.5), instead of moving south, the path should proceed directly to the right, going around obstacles 5 and 6. 
- A point near the goal but safely to the right of obstacle 4 is (6.5, 10.5).
- From there, the path can safely move down to (6.5, 4.5).
- Finally, move to the left to the goal, (4.5, 4.5).

This approach keeps the path further away from the obstacles, minimizing the risk of collisions.

Here is the updated path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),

[08/22/2024 11:55:51 AM] The path collides with obstacle 5 because it tries to cross it directly.  To fix this, we need to route the path around this obstacle. 

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Current Path Analysis:** The existing path tries to navigate directly from (15.5, 10.5) to (6.5, 10.5) and then down to (6.5, 4.5), causing collisions with obstacle 5.

2. **Identifying a Safe Passage:** We need to find a way around obstacle 5. Since obstacle 5 occupies the x-range from 5.0 to 14.0 for the y-range of 4.0 to 10.0, we need to go around it.

3. **Adjusting the Path:** 
    - Instead of going directly to (6.5, 10.5), let's first move to a point with x-coordinate less than 5.0 to avoid obstacle 5. (4.5, 10.5) seems a good option as it gives some clearance.
    - From (4.5, 10.5), we can safely move down to (4.5, 4.5), bypassing obstacle 5 completely.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 15.5), (15.5, 15.5), (15.5, 10.5), (4.5, 10.5), (4.5, 4.5)]
