# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.75, 0.75], [0.25, 0.75], [0.25, 0.25], [0.75, 0.25]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.0, 0.0], [-2.0, 0.0], [-2.0, -2.0], [15.0, -2.0]]

[08/22/2024 11:36:08 AM] The previous path attempts to move directly from the start to the goal set, resulting in collisions with obstacles 3 and 4. To circumvent this, the path needs to navigate around these obstacles.

1. **Initial Movement:** The first segment of the path from (0.5, 0.5) to (0.5, 1.5) is unobstructed and can be kept.

2. **Navigating Obstacle 3:** To avoid Obstacle 3, the path needs to move above its upper boundary (y = 14.0). Therefore, a new waypoint will be added at (0.5, 14.5), safely above the obstacle.

3. **Approaching the Goal:** With Obstacle 3 cleared, the path can proceed rightwards towards the goal. To avoid Obstacle 4, which extends to x = 14.0, a waypoint will be added at (14.5, 14.5), placing it safely to the right of the obstacle. 

4. **Final Approach:** From (14.5, 14.5), the path has a clear line of sight to the goal set. It can descend directly to a point within the goal set, such as (4.5, 4.5).

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),

Please submit a quota increase request. https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/quotas-genai. Trying attempt 1
[08/22/2024 11:36:22 AM] The original path tried to go around obstacles 5 and 6 from the top. However, the last segment crossed through these obstacles. 

To avoid this, we can navigate the path between obstacles 3 and 4. 

Here's the updated path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set.
    (0.5, 1.5),    # Move upwards to avoid obstacle 2. 
    (3.5, 1.5),    # Move rightwards towards the gap between obstacles 3 and 4.
    (3.5, 4.5),    # Move downwards to enter the goal set.
    (4.5, 4.5)     # End within the goal set.
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Moving Upwards:** The first two waypoints remain the same, ensuring a clear path above obstacle 2.
2. **Navigating the Gap:** The third waypoint is adjusted to (3.5, 1.5) to position the path within the gap between obstacles 3 and 4. 
3. **Reaching the Goal Set:** From the gap, the path moves downwards to (3.5, 4.5) and then finally to (4.5, 4.5), ensuring it ends within the goal set.

This revised path successfully avoids all obstacles by carefully utilizing the gap between obstacles 3 and 4.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:36:29 AM] The primary issue with the initial path is its collision with Obstacle 3. To rectify this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle. 

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Initial Movement:** The first waypoint (0.5, 0.5) is acceptable. 
2. **Circumventing Obstacle 3:**  Instead of moving horizontally at a y-coordinate of 1.5, we need to move higher to avoid Obstacle 3 entirely.  A safe bet would be to move to a y-coordinate of at least 14.0 (the upper bound of Obstacle 3) + a safety margin. Let's choose 14.5. So, the second waypoint could be (0.5, 14.5).
3. **Clear Path:** From (0.5, 14.5), we can safely move horizontally to a point above the goal, for instance, (4.5, 14.5).
4. **Descending to the Goal:** Finally, move directly downwards to the goal position, (4.5, 4.5).

Therefore, a revised path could be:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 14.5), (4.5, 14.5), (4.5, 4.5)]
```

This path avoids all obstacles and successfully connects the start and goal sets.

[08/22/2024 11:36:36 AM] The issue is that the third segment crosses obstacle 6. To fix this, the path needs to navigate around obstacle 6.  We can do so by going to the right of it.

    (0.5, 14.5), 
    (14.5, 14.5),

    (4.5, 4.5)
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(0.5, 0.5):** Starting point within the start set.
2. **(0.5, 14.5):** Move vertically upwards, staying clear of obstacles 2 and 3.
3. **(14.5, 14.5):**  Move horizontally to the right, staying clear of obstacles 6.
4. **(14.5, 4.5):** Move vertically downwards, staying clear of obstacles 4 and 5.
5. **(4.5, 4.5):** Move horizontally to the left to reach the goal set.

[08/22/2024 11:36:48 AM] The issue is that the fourth segment of the path cuts directly through obstacle 5. To fix this, we need to route the path around this obstacle. 

Here's a possible adjustment and the thought process:

1. **Original path's issue:** The segment (14.5, 4.5) to (4.5, 4.5) cuts through the middle of obstacle 5. 

2. **Identifying a safer passage:** Notice that obstacle 5's top-right corner is at (14.0, 10.0). There's a clear path above this obstacle.

3. **Adjusting the path:** 
   - Instead of going directly from (14.5, 14.5) to (14.5, 4.5), let's first move to (14.5, 10.5) to stay clear above obstacle 5.
   - From there, we can safely move horizontally to (4.5, 10.5).
   - Finally, we move down to (4.5, 4.5) to reach the goal set.

**New Path:**
