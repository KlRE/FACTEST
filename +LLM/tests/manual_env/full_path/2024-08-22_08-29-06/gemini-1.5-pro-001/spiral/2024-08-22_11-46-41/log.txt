# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.75, 0.75], [0.25, 0.75], [0.25, 0.25], [0.75, 0.25]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.0, 0.0], [-2.0, 0.0], [-2.0, -2.0], [15.0, -2.0]]

## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:46:47 AM] Here is a possible path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.75, 0.5),   # Start at the middle of the right edge of the start set
    (0.75, 3.0),   # Move upwards to avoid Obstacle 2
    (3.0, 3.0),   # Move rightwards, staying below Obstacle 3 
    (3.0, 5.5),   # Move upwards, staying to the left of Obstacle 5
    (4.5, 5.5),   # Move rightwards, passing above the goal set
    (4.5, 4.5)    # Move downwards into the center of the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

* The path starts by moving upwards to avoid the large obstacle (Obstacle 2) blocking the way to the right. 
* It then moves rightwards, carefully staying below Obstacle 3 and to the left of Obstacles 5 and 6.
* Finally, it moves above the goal set and then straight down into it.

This path avoids all obstacles with a safe margin and fulfills the start and end conditions.

[08/22/2024 11:46:52 AM] The initial path goes through Obstacle 3. To fix this, we can adjust the path to go around Obstacle 3. 

The path can first move upwards to y = 3.0, then move rightwards towards the goal, passing above Obstacle 3. After safely clearing Obstacle 3, the path can then continue towards the goal. 

Here is the updated path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.75, 0.5),  # Start point
    (0.75, 3.0),  # Move upwards 
    (5.0, 3.0),  # Move rightwards, passing above Obstacle 3

]

[08/22/2024 11:47:00 AM] The initial path was trying to be efficient by directly moving to the goal set. However, it failed to account for obstacles 3, 4, and 5. 

To rectify this, we need to navigate around the obstacles. Here's a possible approach:

1. **Starting Point:** We can keep the initial starting point (0.75, 0.5) as it's safely within the start set.

2. **Navigating Obstacles:** Instead of moving directly right, we'll need to navigate upwards first to avoid obstacles 3 and 4. A safe passage seems to be between obstacles 3 and 6. Then, we can move right, avoiding obstacle 5, to reach the goal set.

3. **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, we can move downwards to a point within the goal set.

Based on this thought process, here's a revised path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.75, 0.5),  # Start
    (0.75, 12.0),  # Move upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 3
    (5.0, 12.0),  # Move right, staying clear of Obstacle 6
    (5.0, 4.5)   # Move down into the goal set 
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles while successfully connecting the start and goal sets.

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

[08/22/2024 11:47:07 AM] The initial path goes directly above Obstacle 3 and through Obstacles 5 and 6. To avoid this, we need to route the path below these obstacles. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

1. **Start:** (0.75, 0.5) - Same as before, within the start set.
2. **Navigate below Obstacles:** (0.75, 0.25) - Move down slightly to be clear of the start set. 
3. **Continue below Obstacles:** (1.0, 0.25) - Move slightly to the right to be clear of Obstacle 3.
4. **Continue below Obstacles:** (1.0, 3.5) - Move down, staying clear of Obstacle 3.
5. **Approach goal:** (5.0, 3.5)  - Move right, staying below Obstacles 5 and 6.
6. **End:** (5.0, 4.5) - Move up into the goal set.

**New Path:**

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:47:16 AM] The original path attempts to navigate directly to the goal but encounters several obstacles. It needs adjustments to successfully reach the goal set without collisions.

1. **Initial Segment:** The segment from (0.75, 0.5) to (0.75, 0.25) is fine as it stays within the start set. 

2. **Navigating Obstacles 3 and 4:** The path needs to avoid Obstacles 3 and 4. It can do this by moving to the right before reaching Obstacle 3, then going up, and then moving right again towards the goal. 

3. **Avoiding Obstacle 5:**  We need to ensure the path stays clear of Obstacle 5, which sits to the right of the goal set.

Here's a possible revised path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.75, 0.5),     // Start within the start set
    (0.75, 0.25),    // Continue within the start set
    (3.5, 0.25),    // Move right, staying below Obstacle 3
    (3.5, 3.5),     // Move upwards, staying left of Obstacle 4 
    (5.0, 3.5),     // Move right, reaching the goal set
    (5.0, 4.5)      // End within the goal set
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles:

* It clears Obstacle 3 by staying below its lower boundary (y = 1.0).
* It navigates around Obstacle 4 by staying to its left (x = 4.0).
* It remains clear of Obstacle 5 by approaching the goal set from a point below it (y = 3.5).

[08/22/2024 11:47:23 AM] The initial path was trying to be too direct, leading to collisions with obstacles 3, 4, and 5.  We need to find a way around these obstacles.  

1. **Navigate around Obstacle 3:** Instead of going straight up from the start, we can first move right, staying below obstacle 3, until we are clear to move upwards. 

2. **Clear Obstacle 4:** Once past obstacle 3, we need to clear obstacle 4. Since we can't go directly upwards, we can continue moving right until we are to the right of obstacle 4 and 5.

3. **Final Approach:** Now that we're clear of the main obstacles, we can move upwards towards the goal, ensuring we stay clear of the top-right corner of obstacle 5.

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:47:32 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate directly to the goal but encounters several obstacles.  We need to adjust the path to safely maneuver around these obstacles.

1. **Initial segment:** The first segment from (0.75, 0.5) to (3.0, 0.5) travels too close to obstacle 3. We need to route the path above obstacle 3. 

2. **Navigating Obstacles 3 and 4:** To avoid obstacles 3 and 4, we can route the path upwards, staying clear of their top boundaries. A safe passage appears to exist between obstacles 3 and 6.

3. **Approaching the Goal:** Once we clear obstacle 6, we can proceed towards the goal region.

Here's a revised path based on these adjustments:

```
new_path = [
    (0.75, 0.5),    # Starting point
    (0.75, 14.5),   # Move above obstacles 3 and 6
    (6.0, 14.5),   # Move right, staying above obstacle 6
    (6.0, 4.5),    # Move down towards the goal
    (5.0, 4.5)     # Reach the goal
]
```

This revised path aims to avoid all obstacles by maintaining a safe distance and navigating through the open spaces identified in the analysis.

[08/22/2024 11:47:41 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid obstacles 5 and 6.  We can route the path around the left side of these obstacles.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.75, 0.5),        # Start in the start set
    (0.75, 14.5),       # Move upwards, staying clear of obstacles

    (3.0, 3.5),        # Move downwards, passing left of obstacles 5 & 6
    (5.0, 3.5),        # Move right towards the goal set
    (5.0, 4.5)         # Move up into the goal set
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Waypoint (3.0, 14.5):**  Added a waypoint to move left before descending, ensuring a safe distance from Obstacle 6.
2. **Waypoint (3.0, 3.5):** Moved this waypoint further down to ensure the path passes completely to the left of Obstacle 5.
3. **Waypoint (5.0, 3.5):** This waypoint ensures a clear horizontal path towards the goal set. 

This revised path avoids all obstacles while maintaining a clear and direct route from the start to the goal.

[08/22/2024 11:47:50 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate directly to the goal but encounters obstacles along the way. To correct this, the path needs to be adjusted to maneuver around these obstacles.

Starting from (0.75, 0.5), we can initially follow the original path upwards. However, instead of going to (0.75, 14.5), we need to navigate around Obstacle 3. 

One approach is to move rightward, staying clear of Obstacle 3, then proceed upwards.  Let's add a waypoint at (4.5, 0.5) to move right, avoiding Obstacle 3. From there, we can safely move upwards to (4.5, 14.5), bypassing Obstacle 3 and staying clear of Obstacle 6. 

Then, we can continue to the original waypoint (3.0, 14.5).  From there, we need to navigate down to the goal set while avoiding Obstacles 3, 4, and 5. We can do this by moving rightward to (14.5, 14.5), bypassing all three obstacles. Finally, we can move down to (14.5, 4.5) and then left to reach the goal set at (5.0, 4.5).

Here's the revised path:

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:47:58 AM] The initial path goes through obstacles 4 and 6. To correct this, we can adjust the path to navigate around these obstacles.

1. **Segment 2 Intersection:** The segment between (4.5, 0.5) and (4.5, 14.5) intersects with obstacles 4 and 6. We need to find a way around these obstacles. 

2. **Navigating Obstacles 4 and 6:** Looking at the spatial arrangement, we can navigate around obstacles 4 and 6 by going to the right of them. To do this, we can modify the path to first move right towards x = 14.5, then upwards, and finally back towards the goal.

3. **Segment 6 Intersection:** The segment between (14.5, 4.5) and (5.0, 4.5) intersects obstacle 5. We need to adjust the y-coordinate to go above obstacle 5.

Therefore, the corrected path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.75, 0.5),        # Start point
    (14.5, 0.5),       # Move right to clear obstacles 4 and 6
    (14.5, 14.5),      # Move upwards, staying clear of obstacle 6
    (14.5, 4.5),      # Move down, staying to the right of obstacle 5
    (5.0, 4.5)         # End point 
]

[08/22/2024 11:48:16 AM] The path intersects with Obstacle 5 because it attempts to move directly from (14.5, 4.5) to (5.0, 4.5). To avoid this, we can route the path around the obstacle.  

Here's how we can adjust the path:

1. **From the previous waypoint (14.5, 14.5), move down to a point below Obstacle 5.**  A safe y-coordinate would be 3.5.
2. **Move horizontally towards the goal set.**  We can use the x-coordinate 5.0 to ensure we end up inside the goal set. 

Here's the updated path:

```
new_path = [(0.75, 0.5), (14.5, 0.5), (14.5, 14.5), (14.5, 3.5), (5.0, 3.5), (5.0, 4.5)]
```

This path avoids all obstacles and reaches the goal set successfully.

[08/22/2024 11:48:26 AM] The path needs adjustments to avoid obstacles. Here's a possible approach:

1. **Initial Segment:** The first segment from (0.75, 0.5) to (14.5, 0.5) is safe and remains unchanged.
2. **Navigating Upwards:** The second segment goes from (14.5, 0.5) to (14.5, 14.5). This movement is also clear of obstacles and can stay as is.
3. **Avoiding Obstacle Cluster:** The original path's attempt to directly reach the goal encounters Obstacles 4 and 5. We need to find a way around them.
    - **Option 1: Go Above:**  Since the path is already at (14.5, 14.5), it's above all obstacles.  We can simply move left towards the goal: (14.5, 14.5) -> (5.0, 14.5) -> (5.0, 4.5) 
    - **Option 2: Maneuver Between Obstacles:** This option is more complex but might be desirable if there were constraints higher up. It would involve moving left to a point between obstacles 5 and 6, then carefully navigating downwards to approach the goal from the left. 

**Choosing a Path:**  For simplicity and assuming no constraints in the higher y-coordinate area, Option 1 (going above) is more efficient.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.75, 0.5), 
    (14.5, 0.5), 
    (14.5, 14.5),

Instead of going directly to the goal from the top, we can route the path around obstacle 6 by going to the right. Then, we can navigate downwards, passing safely between obstacles 5 and 6 to reach the goal set. 

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.75, 0.5),    # Start in the start set
    (14.5, 0.5),   # Move right, staying clear of obstacles
    (14.5, 14.5),  # Move upwards, clear of obstacles 
    (14.5, 8.5),   # Move down, staying clear of obstacle 6
    (5.0, 8.5),    # Move left, passing between obstacles 5 and 6
    (5.0, 4.5)     # Move down to the center of the goal set
]

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.75, 0.75], [0.25, 0.75], [0.25, 0.25], [0.75, 0.25]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.0, 0.0], [-2.0, 0.0], [-2.0, -2.0], [15.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.0, 15.0], [-2.0, 15.0], [-2.0, -0.0], [0.0, -0.0]]

    Obstacle Avoidance (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
		Segment 4 between points (14.5, 8.5) and (5.0, 8.5) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 5: [[14.0, 10.0], [5.0, 10.0], [5.0, 4.0], [14.0, 4.0]]

			Obstacle 5: [[14.0, 10.0], [5.0, 10.0], [5.0, 4.0], [14.0, 4.0]]
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction

    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:48:37 AM] The path intersects with Obstacle 5 because segment 4 moves from the right side of the obstacle to its left side on the y=8.5 line. Segment 5 then tries to move down from within the obstacle. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around Obstacle 5. 

One way to do this is by going around the top of Obstacle 5:

new_path = [
    (0.75, 0.5), 
    (14.5, 0.5), 
    (14.5, 14.5), 
    (14.5, 11.5), # Move above Obstacle 5
    (4.5, 11.5),   # Move horizontally to the left of Obstacle 5
    (4.5, 4.5)    # Move down to the goal

[08/22/2024 11:48:44 AM] The original path attempts to navigate above the obstacles to reach the goal. However, the segments connecting (14.5, 11.5) to (4.5, 11.5) and (4.5, 11.5) to (4.5, 4.5) collide with Obstacle 6. 

To rectify this, we can adjust the path to navigate below Obstacle 6 instead of above it.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.75, 0.5),  # Start point within the start set
    (14.5, 0.5),  # Move right, staying below Obstacle 1 and 2
    (14.5, 3.5),  # Move down, staying to the right of Obstacle 4 and 5
    (4.5, 3.5),   # Move left, passing below Obstacle 6
    (4.5, 4.5)    # Move up to reach the goal point within the goal set
]
```

This revised path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles while successfully connecting the start and goal sets.

[08/22/2024 11:48:51 AM] The original path fails because it tries to cross obstacles to reach the goal. I will adjust the path to go around the obstacles.

* **Going Up:** We need to navigate above obstacles 3 and 6. Let's set a waypoint to (0.75, 14.5).
* **Going Right:** Now, we need to go past obstacle 2. A waypoint at (14.5, 14.5) will work. 
* **Descending:** We can now descend towards the goal, setting a waypoint at (14.5, 4.5) to avoid obstacle 5. 
* **Final Approach:**  Finally, move left to (4.5, 4.5), which is inside the goal set.

[08/22/2024 11:49:17 AM] The issue is with the segment connecting (14.5, 14.5) and (14.5, 4.5) which cuts through Obstacle 5. 

To fix this, we can route the path around obstacle 5.  Since we are already going around obstacles above the goal, let's route the path below obstacle 5.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.75, 0.5),        # Start
    (0.75, 14.5),       # Move up
    (14.5, 14.5),      # Move right 
    (14.5, 3.5),       # Move down, clearing obstacle 5
    (4.5, 3.5),        # Move left towards the goal
    (4.5, 4.5)         # Move up into the goal set 
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles:

* It starts within the start set.
* It goes up and over all obstacles to the right of the start.
* It then moves down, staying clear of obstacle 5. 
* Finally, it moves left and up into the goal set.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

[08/22/2024 11:49:22 AM] The original path collides with Obstacle 4 because it attempts to move directly across the map. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate above or below this obstacle. Given the layout of the obstacles, it's more efficient to navigate above Obstacle 4.  We can do this by adding waypoints to route around Obstacle 4.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.75, 0.5),      # Start in the start set
    (0.75, 14.5),     # Move upwards, clearing all obstacles
    (14.5, 14.5),    # Move right, staying clear of obstacles

]

[08/22/2024 11:49:29 AM] The issue lies in the fourth segment of the path, which cuts through Obstacle 5. To rectify this, we need to route the path around this obstacle. 

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Maintain upward trajectory:**  Instead of directly moving towards the goal's x-coordinate from (0.75, 14.5), continue upwards to a point clear of Obstacle 6. Let's say (0.75, 15.5). 
2. **Navigate rightward:** From (0.75, 15.5), move rightward, staying clear of Obstacle 6. A suitable waypoint could be (14.5, 15.5).
3. **Descend to goal:**  Finally, descend from (14.5, 15.5) to a point within the goal set, avoiding Obstacle 5. The endpoint (4.5, 4.5) remains valid.

This approach provides a clear path around Obstacle 5 while staying within the bounds of other obstacles.

Therefore, the revised path is: 

```
new_path = [(0.75, 0.5), (0.75, 14.5), (0.75, 15.5), (14.5, 15.5), (14.5, 4.5), (4.5, 4.5)]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:49:37 AM] The issue is with the segment connecting (14.5, 4.5) to (4.5, 4.5) as it directly cuts through Obstacle 5. 

To fix this, we can adjust the path to go around Obstacle 5. We can achieve this by going up above Obstacle 5 before heading towards the goal.

Here's the updated path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.75, 0.5),   # Start
    (0.75, 14.5),  # Move up
    (0.75, 15.5),  # Move up further to clear any potential issues 
    (14.5, 15.5),  # Move right 
    (14.5, 10.5), # Move down, clearing Obstacle 5
    (4.5, 10.5), # Move left
    (4.5, 4.5)   # Move down to the goal 
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles by:

*  Moving to a y-coordinate greater than the top of Obstacle 5
*  Moving right to an x-coordinate greater than the right edge of Obstacle 5
*  Moving down to the same y-coordinate as the goal 
*  Moving left to reach the goal
