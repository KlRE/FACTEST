# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:24:09 AM] The provided environment presents a challenging but solvable pathfinding problem. Here's a manually designed path considering the obstacles:

**Analysis:**

1. **Initial Challenge:** Obstacles 2, 3, 4, and 5 create a significant barrier directly in line with the start and goal. 
2. **Vertical Pathway:**  There's a clear vertical channel between Obstacles 5 and 7, and Obstacles 10 and 12.
3. **Maneuvering Obstacles:** We need to carefully navigate around Obstacles 8 and 12 to reach the goal.

**Proposed Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),   # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 2.5),   # Move down, staying clear of Obstacle 3 
    (2.5, 2.5),   # Move right, staying below Obstacles 4 and 5 
    (2.5, 4.25),  # Move up, carefully navigating between Obstacles 8 and the top edge of Obstacle 5
    (5.5, 4.25),  # Move right, staying below Obstacle 12
    (6.5, 4.75)   # Move slightly up and right to end within the goal set 
]
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Precision:**  The coordinates provided assume a reasonable clearance from the obstacles. You might need slight adjustments depending on how strictly "touching" is defined. 
* **Visualization:** It's highly recommended to visually plot these waypoints and obstacles on a graph to confirm the path's validity.

Let me know if you have any other pathfinding scenarios you'd like to explore!

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:24:22 AM] The initial path has several intersections with the obstacles. Let's analyze and correct each segment:

1. **Segment 1 (0.5, 3.5) to (0.5, 2.5):** This segment intersects with obstacles 3 and 5.  To avoid this, we can move right before going down, navigating around obstacle 3.

2. **Segment 2 (0.5, 2.5) to (2.5, 2.5):** This segment also intersects with obstacles 3 and 5. Since we've decided to navigate around obstacle 3 from above, we need to adjust the second waypoint further right, past obstacle 5.

3. **Segment 3 (2.5, 2.5) to (2.5, 4.25):**  This segment intersects with obstacle 2.  We need to add a waypoint to move right before moving up, navigating around obstacle 2. 

4. **Segment 4 (2.5, 4.25) to (5.5, 4.25):** This segment is clear and doesn't require any modifications.

5. **Segment 5 (5.5, 4.25) to (6.5, 4.75):** This segment intersects with obstacle 12.  To avoid this, we can adjust the path to approach the goal set from a less steep angle, staying clear of obstacle 12.

Considering these modifications, here is a possible corrected path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),   # Start Point
    (1.5, 3.5),   # Move right to avoid obstacle 3 
    (1.5, 2.5),   # Move down, clear of obstacle 3 and 5 
    (3.5, 2.5),   # Move right, clear of obstacle 2
    (3.5, 4.25),  # Move up, clear of obstacle 2
    (5.5, 4.25),  # Continue on the original path
    (6.5, 4.5)    # End Point, adjusted for a smoother entry 
]
```

This new path avoids all obstacles while staying within the start and goal sets.

### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:24:34 AM] The initial path had several intersections with obstacles, so we need to adjust the route. 

1. **Segment 2 ( (1.5, 3.5) to (1.5, 2.5) ) and Obstacle 4:** This segment goes straight down and collides with Obstacle 4.  We need to navigate around this obstacle.

2. **Segment 3 ( (1.5, 2.5) to (3.5, 2.5) ) and Obstacle 5:** This segment moves right and intersects Obstacle 5. We'll need to adjust the path to go below Obstacle 5.

3. **Segment 4 ( (3.5, 2.5) to (3.5, 4.25) ) and Obstacle 2:** This segment goes straight up and hits Obstacle 2. We must find a way to move to the right before going up.

4. **Segment 6 ( (5.5, 4.25) to (6.5, 4.5) ) and Obstacle 12:** This segment goes diagonally and collides with Obstacle 12. We can avoid this by moving further to the right before approaching the goal. 

**New Path:**

Based on the above analysis, here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),    # Start within the start set 
    (1.5, 3.5),    # Move right
    (1.5, 1.75),   # Move down, clearing Obstacles 4 and 5
    (3.75, 1.75),  # Move right, staying below Obstacle 2 
    (3.75, 4.25),  # Move up, clear of all obstacles
    (6.5, 4.25),  # Move right, avoiding Obstacle 12
    (6.5, 4.5)     # End within the goal set 
]
```

This new path avoids all the obstacles while successfully connecting the start and goal sets.

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:24:44 AM] The initial path has several intersections with obstacles and needs adjustments. Let's analyze each problematic segment:

1. **Segment 2:** (1.5, 3.5) to (1.5, 1.75) collides with Obstacle 4. We need to navigate around this obstacle. Since there's clear space to the right, let's reroute the path eastward before going south.

2. **Segment 4:** (3.75, 1.75) to (3.75, 4.25) intersects both Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 6. To avoid these, we can move further east before going north, utilizing the space between Obstacle 2 and the eastern boundary.

3. **Segment 5:** (3.75, 4.25) to (6.5, 4.25) cuts through Obstacle 12.  We can circumvent this by continuing eastward at a higher y-coordinate, then moving south to reach the goal.

Considering these adjustments, here's a revised path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),     # Start within the start set
    (2.5, 3.5),     # Move east, clearing Obstacle 4
    (2.5, 1.5),     # Move south, clearing Obstacle 4
    (5.75, 1.5),    # Move east, navigating between Obstacles 2 & 6 and below Obstacle 12
    (5.75, 4.25),   # Move north, clearing Obstacle 12
    (6.5, 4.25),   # Move east towards the goal
    (6.5, 4.5)      # End within the goal set 
]
```

This path addresses the obstacle collisions while adhering to the start and end set requirements.

[08/22/2024 10:24:53 AM] The initial path had several intersections with obstacles. To correct this, a new path is proposed that navigates around the obstacles while staying within the defined boundaries. 

1. **Start:** (0.5, 3.5) - Remains unchanged as it is within the start set. 

2. **Navigate Right:** (3.5, 3.5) - Move horizontally to the right, avoiding obstacles 3, 4, 5, and 8.

3. **Move Down:** (3.5, 1.5) -  Descend vertically, steering clear of obstacles 6 and 7.

4. **Proceed Right:** (5.5, 1.5) - Continue moving right, avoiding obstacle 11.

5. **Ascend:** (5.5, 4.25) - Move upwards, circumventing obstacle 12.

6. **Final Approach:** (6.5, 4.25) - Approach the goal horizontally.

7. **End:** (6.5, 4.5) - Conclude the path within the goal set.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:25:06 AM] The initial path attempts to take a somewhat direct route to the goal, but it runs into several obstacles:

* **Segment 1:**  Crosses obstacle 8 because it tries to go directly right from the start.
* **Segment 2:** Crosses obstacle 6 because it cuts down too early.
* **Segment 3:**  Crosses obstacle 7 because it maintains a straight line.
* **Segment 4:**  Crosses obstacle 11 because it goes straight up.
* **Segment 5:**  Crosses obstacle 12 because it goes right at the same y-coordinate as the top of obstacle 11.

To fix this, the path needs to navigate more carefully around the obstacles:

1. **Starting Point:** We can keep the same starting point.

2. **Maneuvering Obstacles 1-8:**  Instead of going right immediately, the path should move up and hug the left-hand side of the environment. This avoids obstacles 1, 3, 4, and 5 entirely. By going above obstacle 8, and then angling down, we can avoid obstacles 6 and 7.

3. **Approaching the Goal:** Once past obstacle 7, the path has a clear run to the right. To avoid obstacles 9, 10, 11, and 13, we'll aim for a point just above obstacle 11.  

4. **Final Stretch:** From there, we can move up slightly to avoid obstacle 12, then go right to the goal.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),    # Start
    (0.5, 4.5),    # Move up to avoid obstacles 1-5
    (3.5, 2.5),    # Angle down to avoid 6 and 7
    (5.25, 2.5),   # Move right, aiming between obstacles 11 and 13 
    (5.25, 4.25),  # Move up to clear obstacle 12
    (6.5, 4.25)   # Move right to the goal

]

[08/22/2024 10:25:16 AM] The previous path had several intersections with obstacles and did not end in the goal set. I'll analyze the environment and come up with a new path.

1. **Starting Point:** I'll keep the starting point at (0.5, 3.5) as it's well within the start set.

2. **Navigating Obstacles:**
   -  The initial path's segment to (0.5, 4.5) is fine, as it stays clear of Obstacle 2. 
   -  Instead of going diagonally down, I'll navigate right, above Obstacle 2. A safe waypoint could be (2.5, 4.5).
   -  From there, I can move down to (2.5, 2.5), staying clear of Obstacle 8 and the top-right corner of Obstacle 7.
   -  Next, I'll carefully move right, going around the corner of Obstacle 10. A good waypoint would be (4.8, 2.5).
   -  Now, I can move upwards, passing between Obstacle 10 and 12. A safe waypoint is (4.8, 4.25).
   -  Finally, I can move right to reach the goal set, ending at (6.5, 4.25).

3. **Goal Set:** The final waypoint (6.5, 4.25) lies within the goal set.

**New Path:**

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:25:26 AM] The previous path had several intersections with obstacles. Let's break down the path planning step-by-step:

1. **Start:** We can keep the starting point at (0.5, 3.5).

2. **Moving Upwards:** The initial upward movement to (0.5, 4.5) is fine as it doesn't intersect any obstacles.

3. **Navigating Obstacles:**
   - The path needs to go around Obstacle 2. 
   - We can achieve this by moving rightwards to a point with x-coordinate greater than 5 (Obstacle 2's right edge) while staying below y=3.9 to avoid intersecting with Obstacle 2. Let's pick (5.25, 3.75).
   - From there, we can move upwards to a point above Obstacle 2, choosing a y-coordinate greater than 4. This could be (5.25, 4.25).

4. **Reaching the Goal:** Now we are in a good position to move directly rightwards to reach the goal set. We can choose the endpoint as (6.5, 4.25), which lies within the goal set.

Therefore, the corrected path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5), 
    (0.5, 4.5), 
    (5.25, 3.75),
    (5.25, 4.25),

]

[08/22/2024 10:25:34 AM] The previous path failed to avoid obstacles and reach the goal set. Let's analyze the environment and find a new valid path:

1. **Starting Point:** We can use the same starting point (0.5, 3.5) as it lies within the start set.

2. **Navigating Obstacles:**
   -  We need to move upwards to avoid Obstacles 2 and 10. 
   -  Obstacle 16 restricts our movement directly upwards to the top. 

3. **Intermediate Waypoint:**
   - We need an intermediate waypoint to navigate around Obstacle 16. Let's choose a point to the right, before reaching Obstacle 16. A possible waypoint is (2.0, 3.5).

4. **Reaching the Goal Set:**
   - From (2.0, 3.5), we can move upwards to (2.0, 5.25) going above Obstacles 2 and 10. 
   - Then, we move right, safely passing above all obstacles to a point within the goal set (6.5, 5.25).

Therefore, a possible corrected path is:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 3.5), (2.0, 3.5), (2.0, 5.25), (6.5, 5.25)]

[08/22/2024 10:25:45 AM] The previous path failed to avoid obstacles and reach the goal set. Here's a breakdown of the adjustments:

1. **Starting Point:** We'll keep the starting point at (0.5, 3.5) within the start set.

2. **Navigating Obstacles:** 
    * The first obstacle cluster (Obstacles 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) lies predominantly below the y=3.5 line. We can navigate above this cluster.
    * Obstacle 2 extends from y=3.9 to y=4.0. To go above it, we'll aim for a y-value greater than 4.0.
    * Obstacles 9, 10, 11, 13 lie below y=3.5 and won't pose a problem if we stay above that line.
    * Obstacle 12 extends from y=2.0 to y=5.0, but its x-values are all greater than 5.9. We can safely navigate to the left of this obstacle.

3. **Reaching the Goal:**
    * The goal set's y-values range from 4.5 to 5.0. We need to adjust our path to fall within this range.

4. **New Path:**
    * From (0.5, 3.5), we can move directly rightwards to a point like (2.5, 3.5).
    * Then, move upwards to (2.5, 4.25), safely clearing Obstacle 2.
    * Continue rightwards to (6.5, 4.25), staying clear of Obstacle 12.
    * Finally, move downwards to (6.5, 4.75), which lies within the goal set.

**Therefore, the corrected path is:**

```

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:25:51 AM] The original path goes through obstacles 2 and 12. To fix this, the path needs to navigate around these obstacles. 

First, the path can move to the right, staying above obstacle 1 and below obstacle 2. Once clear of obstacle 2, the path can then move upwards towards the goal. This will require an additional waypoint to navigate around the corner of obstacle 2. Then, to avoid obstacle 12, the path needs to stay below its lower boundary at y = 2. Therefore, the path can move rightwards below obstacle 12. Finally, it can move upwards to reach the goal set. 

Here's the updated path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5), 
    (5.5, 3.5),  
    (5.5, 1.5),

[08/22/2024 10:26:00 AM] The initial path has collisions because it tries to move directly to the right and then down, intersecting with obstacles along the way. To fix this, the path needs to navigate around these obstacles more carefully. 

Here's a possible approach:

1. **From the start:** Begin at (0.5, 3.5). Instead of moving right immediately, move downwards to (0.5, 2.5) to avoid obstacle 8.
2. **Navigate right:**  Move right to a point between obstacles 6 and 7, say (3.5, 2.5).
3. **Continue right:**  Keep moving right, navigating below obstacles 10 and 11. A suitable point could be (5.5, 2.5).
4. **Move upwards:**  Now safely below the obstacles, move upwards to (5.5, 4.75), reaching the goal set.
5. **Reach the goal:** Finally, move slightly right to reach a point within the goal set, such as (6.5, 4.75).

Therefore, the corrected path is:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 3.5), (0.5, 2.5), (3.5, 2.5), (5.5, 2.5), (5.5, 4.75), (6.5, 4.75)]

[08/22/2024 10:26:22 AM] The initial path was a good attempt, but it crossed several obstacles. I will adjust it by analyzing the environment and finding safe passageways.

- **Segment 2 ((0.5, 2.5) to (3.5, 2.5))**: This segment intersects with obstacles 3 and 5. To avoid them, we can route the path above these obstacles. A safe passage exists between the top of obstacle 3 (y=3.0) and the bottom of obstacle 2 (y=3.9). 
- **Segment 3 ((3.5, 2.5) to (5.5, 2.5))**: This segment intersects with obstacles 7 and 10. To avoid them, we can direct the path upwards before obstacle 7, then move right above it.
- **Segment 5 ((5.5, 4.75) to (6.5, 4.75))**: This segment intersects with obstacle 12. To avoid this, we can simply stay on the left side of obstacle 12 (x=5.9) and move directly into the goal set.

Based on these observations, here's a possible corrected path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),   # Start point
    (0.5, 3.25),  # Move up slightly to avoid potential collision with obstacle 3 
    (3.5, 3.25),  # Move right, staying above obstacles 3 and 5
    (3.5, 4.25),  # Move up, staying to the left of obstacle 7 
    (5.5, 4.25),  # Move right, staying above obstacle 10
    (5.9, 4.25),  # Approach the goal, staying left of obstacle 12
    (6.5, 4.75)   # Arrive at the goal
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles while staying within the defined start and goal sets.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:26:34 AM] The initial path has several intersections with obstacles. Let's analyze each problematic segment and adjust the waypoints:

1. **Segment 2: (0.5, 3.25) to (3.5, 3.25)** collides with Obstacle 8. To avoid this, we can route the path upwards, clear of Obstacle 8, before moving horizontally.

2. **Segment 3: (3.5, 3.25) to (3.5, 4.25)** intersects Obstacle 2. We should reroute the path to the right *before* reaching x=3.5, navigating around the left side of Obstacle 2. 

3. **Segments 5 and 6: (5.5, 4.25) to (5.9, 4.25) to (6.5, 4.75)** both intersect Obstacle 12.  These segments attempt to navigate through a narrow passage between Obstacles 12 and 17.  Instead, we can simplify by routing the path below Obstacle 12 before approaching the goal. 

Considering these adjustments, here's a possible revised path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),     # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 3.75),    # Move up to avoid Obstacle 8
    (3.25, 3.75),   # Move right, staying clear of Obstacle 8
    (3.25, 4.25),   # Move up, navigating around Obstacle 2
    (5.5, 4.25),    # Continue right towards the goal
    (5.5, 4.0),     # Move down, staying clear of Obstacle 12
    (6.5, 4.0),     # Move right, approaching the goal from below Obstacle 12
    (6.5, 4.75)     # Move up to end within the goal set
]
```

This revised path aims to address the collisions identified in the feedback by strategically repositioning waypoints to navigate around the obstacles.

[08/22/2024 10:26:44 AM] The initial path was a good attempt, but it crossed some obstacles. Here's how I'll adjust it:

* **Segment 2 crossing Obstacle 8:**  The path needs to go around Obstacle 8. I'll add a waypoint to the left of Obstacle 8 to guide the path around it.
* **Segment 3 crossing Obstacle 2:** This segment goes directly through Obstacle 2. I'll adjust the waypoint to go above Obstacle 2 by increasing the y-coordinate.
* **Segment 6 crossing Obstacle 12:** The path tries to cut through the narrow gap in Obstacle 12. I'll reroute the path to go around Obstacle 12 by adding a waypoint below it. 

Here's the corrected path:

```
new_path = [

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:26:53 AM] The path needs adjustments to avoid colliding with Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 12. 

- **Issue 1: Collision with Obstacle 2:** Segment 3 attempts to move upwards from (2.5, 3.75) to (2.5, 4.25), directly through Obstacle 2. 
- **Solution:** Instead of moving upwards at x=2.5, we can navigate to the right of Obstacle 2. A waypoint at (5.5, 3.75) allows a straight path around the obstacle.

- **Issue 2: Collision with Obstacle 12:** Segment 7 moves from (5.5, 3.5) to (6.5, 3.5), intersecting the bottom corner of Obstacle 12.
- **Solution:** To avoid this, we can route the path above Obstacle 12. Adding a waypoint at (5.5, 5.25) allows us to move upward and then rightward to reach the goal set.

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5), 
    (0.5, 3.75), 
    (5.5, 3.75),  # Move right to clear Obstacle 2
    (5.5, 4.25), 
    (5.5, 5.25),  # Move up to clear Obstacle 12

]

[08/22/2024 10:27:00 AM] The initial path has intersections with obstacles 8 and 10 because it attempts to go directly from the start to the goal. To fix this, the path needs to navigate around these obstacles.

Firstly, the path can move upwards to avoid obstacle 8, which occupies a lower y-coordinate. Then, the path can move rightwards, staying above obstacle 8 and clear of obstacle 10. 

To avoid intersecting with obstacle 17, the path needs to stay below it by adjusting the y-coordinate.

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),    # Start point
    (0.5, 4.25),   # Move upwards to avoid obstacle 8
    (5.5, 4.25),   # Move rightwards, staying above obstacle 8 and clear of obstacle 10

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:27:07 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 12. To achieve this, we can modify the path to go around the obstacle. 

Instead of directly moving towards the goal from (5.5, 4.25), we can add a waypoint below Obstacle 12 to circumvent it. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5), 
    (0.5, 4.25), 
    (5.5, 4.25), 
    (5.5, 2.0),  # New waypoint to go below Obstacle 12
    (6.5, 2.0),  # Move right to avoid the obstacle completely
    (6.5, 4.75)   # Move up to the goal
]
```

This new path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles while reaching the goal.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:27:16 AM] The original path goes directly from a point above the obstacles to a point below, causing collisions with obstacles 11 and 12. 

To correct this, the path needs to navigate around obstacle 11.  Since there's a clear path southward between obstacles 10 and 11, we can adjust the path as follows:

1. **Maintain the first two waypoints**:  `(0.5, 3.5)` and `(0.5, 4.25)` are fine.
2. **Move rightward above obstacle 11**: Instead of going directly down, move rightward to a point with an x-coordinate greater than 6.0 (obstacle 11's right edge), while staying above obstacle 11's y-coordinate of 2.0.  Let's choose the waypoint `(6.25, 4.25)`.
3. **Move downward**: Now we can safely move downward to a point below obstacle 11. We'll target a point between obstacles 11 and 12, for example, `(6.25, 1.75)`.
4. **Proceed to the goal**: The final waypoint `(6.5, 4.75)` is reachable from this position without collisions.

Therefore, the corrected path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5), 
    (0.5, 4.25), 
    (6.25, 4.25), 
    (6.25, 1.75), 
    (6.5, 4.75)
]
```

Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:27:25 AM] The path goes too far down south and intersects with obstacle 13. To fix this, we can add a waypoint to go around obstacle 13.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5), 
    (0.5, 1.5), 
    (5.5, 1.5), 
    (6.5, 1.5),
    (6.5, 4.75)
]
