# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:27:41 AM] The original path has several intersections with the obstacles. To correct it, let's analyze the environment and come up with a new path:

1. **Starting Point:**  We can stick with (0.5, 3.5) as it's a valid starting point within the start set. 

2. **Navigating Obstacles:**
   - We need to move down from the starting point to go below Obstacle 2. A good y-coordinate to aim for is 1.5, which is safely below Obstacle 2 and above most other obstacles in that area.
   -  Let's move right, staying below obstacles. We can go to (2.5, 1.5) which avoids obstacles 3, 4, 5, and 6.
   - From there, we can move further right to (4.5, 1.5), staying below Obstacle 7. 
   - Now, we need to navigate upwards to reach the goal set. There's a clear path upwards at x-coordinate 4.5, so we can move to (4.5, 4.75) which is safely within the goal set. 

3. **Final Point:** We've already reached a valid point within the goal set at (4.5, 4.75).

Therefore, the corrected path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5), 
    (0.5, 1.5), 
    (2.5, 1.5), 
    (4.5, 1.5),
    (4.5, 4.75)
]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:27:48 AM] The previous path failed because it intersected with obstacles 2 and 7. To fix this, the path needs adjustments:

1. **Avoid Obstacle 7:** Instead of going straight to x=2.5 at y=1.5, we should move upwards first to avoid obstacle 7. A safe waypoint could be (1.5, 3.5).
2. **Navigate around Obstacle 2:** From (1.5, 3.5), we need to navigate around the top-left corner of obstacle 2.  A safe waypoint could be (1.5, 4.25).
3. **Reach the Goal:** Finally, we can move right towards the goal set.

Therefore, a corrected path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5), 
    (1.5, 3.5),
    (1.5, 4.25),

[08/22/2024 10:27:54 AM] The initial path went above obstacle 2 and crossed obstacle 12 to reach the goal. Additionally, the final waypoint was not located inside the goal region. 

To correct this, the path needs to be adjusted to navigate below obstacles 2 and 12. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),    # Start within the start set
    (1.5, 3.5),    # Move right, staying below obstacle 2
    (1.5, 2.5),    # Move down, staying to the right of obstacle 3, 4, 5 
    (6.5, 2.5),    # Move right, staying below obstacle 12
    (6.5, 4.75)     # Move up to end within the goal set 
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles and reaches the goal set successfully.

[08/22/2024 10:28:14 AM] The initial path goes south too quickly and gets stuck between obstacles. I will adjust the path to first move east, avoiding the cluster of obstacles near the start, then proceed south, and finally head east towards the goal.

Here's the updated path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),   # Start within the start set
    (2.5, 3.5),   # Move east, staying clear of obstacles 1-5
    (2.5, 2.25),  # Move south, passing between obstacles 6 & 7, and 10 & 11
    (6.5, 2.25),  # Move east, staying clear of obstacle 12 
    (6.5, 4.75)   # Arrive at the goal set
]
```

Here's why this path works:

1. **Initial Eastward Movement:** By moving east initially, we avoid the dense cluster of obstacles 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. 
2. **Strategic Southward Movement:**  Moving south at x = 2.5 allows us to navigate between obstacles 6 & 7 on the left and obstacles 10 & 11 on the right.
3. **Final Eastward Push:** After clearing the obstacle field, we have a clear path to move east towards the goal, staying clear of obstacle 12.

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [

    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:28:22 AM] The initial path went through obstacles 7, 10, and 12. To fix this, the path needs to be adjusted to go around these obstacles. 

Instead of taking a direct line from (2.5, 2.25) to (6.5, 2.25), we can create a detour.  

First, continue moving down to (2.5, 1.25) to avoid obstacle 7. Then move right, staying below obstacle 10 and left of obstacle 12 to a point around (5.75, 1.25).  Finally, move up to (5.75, 4.75) to avoid obstacle 12 and reach a point from which the goal is reachable.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),
    (2.5, 3.5), 
    (2.5, 2.25), 
    (2.5, 1.25), # new waypoint to avoid obstacle 7

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:28:42 AM] The initial path has several intersections with obstacles. Let's analyze each problematic segment:

- **Segment 3:** (2.5, 2.25) to (2.5, 1.25) intersects Obstacle 6. To avoid this, we can route the path to the right of Obstacle 6.

- **Segment 4:** (2.5, 1.25) to (5.75, 1.25) intersects Obstacle 7.  We can bypass this by going above Obstacle 7.

- **Segments 5 & 6:** (5.75, 1.25) to (5.75, 4.75) to (6.5, 4.75) intersect Obstacles 11 and 12.  We can navigate this by staying to the left of these obstacles. 

Therefore, we can adjust the path with the following considerations:

1. **After the start:** Move right to x = 3.5 to clear Obstacle 3, 4, and 5.
2. **Navigate down:** Move down to y = 1.25, staying to the right of Obstacle 6.
3. **Navigate right:** Move right to x = 5.75, staying below Obstacle 7.
4. **Navigate up:**  Move up to y = 4.75, staying left of Obstacles 11 and 12. 
5. **Reach the goal:**  Move right to reach the goal set.


Here's the corrected path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),  # Start
    (3.5, 3.5),  # Right to clear Obstacles 3, 4, 5
    (3.5, 1.25), # Down, right of Obstacle 6
    (5.75, 1.25),# Right, below Obstacle 7

[08/22/2024 10:28:56 AM] The initial path has several intersections with obstacles. I will adjust the path by adding waypoints to navigate around the obstacles.

1. **Segment 1:** (0.5, 3.5) to (3.5, 3.5) intersects Obstacle 8. To avoid this, I will route the path downwards, going around Obstacle 8. 
2. **Segment 2:** (3.5, 3.5) to (3.5, 1.25) intersects Obstacle 6. With the adjusted path, this segment is no longer problematic. 
3. **Segment 3:** (3.5, 1.25) to (5.75, 1.25) intersects Obstacle 7. To avoid this, I will add a waypoint to the left of Obstacle 7.
4. **Segment 4:** (5.75, 1.25) to (5.75, 4.75) intersects Obstacle 11. I will adjust the previously added waypoint to also guide the path around Obstacle 11.
5. **Segment 5:** (5.75, 4.75) to (6.5, 4.75) intersects Obstacle 12. Since the goal is nearby, I will adjust the path to directly reach the goal set without intersecting Obstacle 12. 

Based on this analysis, the adjusted path is as follows:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),  
    (0.5, 2.5), 
    (3.5, 2.5),

### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:29:10 AM] The original path has multiple intersections with obstacles. Let's analyze each problematic segment and find alternative routes:

1. **Segment 2 ((0.5, 2.5) - (3.5, 2.5))**:  This segment cuts directly through obstacles 3 and 5. We can circumvent these by going below them.

2. **Segment 3 ((3.5, 2.5) - (3.5, 1.25))**: This segment collides with obstacle 6.  We'll need to adjust the path to go around this obstacle.

3. **Segment 4 ((3.5, 1.25) - (4.75, 1.25))**: This segment intersects obstacle 7. We can avoid this by moving higher before reaching x-coordinate 4.75.

4. **Segment 5 ((4.75, 1.25) - (4.75, 4.75))**: This segment cuts through the middle of obstacle 2.  We need to navigate around this obstacle.

5. **Segment 6 ((4.75, 4.75) - (6.5, 4.75))**: This segment intersects obstacle 12. We need to find a way to the goal without crossing this obstacle.

Considering these issues, a possible adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),   // Start Point
    (0.5, 1.0),   // Go below obstacles 3 and 5
    (3.5, 1.0),   // Move towards obstacle 6 
    (3.5, 0.5),   // Dip below obstacle 6
    (4.75, 0.5),  // Approach obstacle 7 
    (4.75, 3.75), // Move up to a safe height
    (5.75, 3.75), // Navigate around obstacle 2
    (5.75, 4.75), // Move towards the goal 
    (6.5, 4.75)   // Reach the goal
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles by navigating around them in the x and y directions.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:29:20 AM] The initial path has several intersections with obstacles that need to be addressed. 

**1. Obstacle 1:** The initial path tries to cross directly through Obstacle 1. To avoid this, the path should go below the obstacle.

**2. Obstacle 9:** The path crosses Obstacle 9 while moving upwards. It's necessary to adjust the path to go before this obstacle.

**3. Obstacles 10 and 12:** The path attempts to move rightwards on the right side of Obstacle 10 and then enters the goal set, crossing Obstacle 12. The solution is to navigate to the left side of Obstacle 10 before moving upwards.

Considering these adjustments, a possible corrected path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),   # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Move downwards, clearing Obstacle 1
    (3.5, 0.5),   # Move rightwards, staying below obstacles 1, 6, and 7 
    (3.5, 3.75),  # Move upwards, staying left of Obstacles 8 and 10 
    (5.75, 3.75), # Move rightwards, clearing Obstacle 10 
    (5.75, 4.75), # Move upwards, to reach the goal set
    (6.5, 4.75)   # Move rightwards to end within the goal set
] 
```

This path avoids all obstacles by:

- Going below Obstacles 1, 6, and 7.
- Staying left of Obstacles 8 and 10.
- Then carefully navigating to the goal set without intersecting Obstacles 12.

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:29:34 AM] The initial path has three problematic segments that need adjustments:

1. **Segment 3 ((3.5, 0.5) to (3.5, 3.75))**: This segment crosses Obstacle 6. To avoid this, we can guide the path around the left side of Obstacle 6. 

2. **Segment 4 ((3.5, 3.75) to (5.75, 3.75))**: This segment crosses Obstacle 10. To avoid this, the path needs to move upwards before reaching x-coordinate 5, essentially navigating above Obstacle 10.

3. **Segment 6 ((5.75, 4.75) to (6.5, 4.75))**: This segment crosses Obstacle 12. Since the goal set is just to the right of Obstacle 12, adjusting the y-coordinate of the penultimate waypoint to be within the goal set's range will solve the issue.

Here's the adjusted path incorporating these fixes:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),       # Starting point (unchanged)
    (0.5, 0.5),       # Move down, clear of obstacles (unchanged)
    (2.0, 0.5),       # Move right, staying below Obstacle 6
    (2.0, 4.25),      # Move up, clear of Obstacle 6 and above Obstacle 10
    (5.75, 4.25),     # Move right, staying above Obstacle 10
    (5.75, 4.75),     # Move up, within the goal set's y-range 
    (6.5, 4.75)      # Move right to the final point within the goal set 
]

[08/22/2024 10:29:42 AM] The initial path has collisions with obstacles on segments 3 and 6. 

- **Segment 3:** This segment goes vertically from (2.0, 0.5) to (2.0, 4.25), colliding with obstacles 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6. 
    - To avoid these obstacles, we can route the path to the right of these obstacles.
- **Segment 6:** This segment moves horizontally from (5.75, 4.75) to (6.5, 4.75), colliding with obstacle 12.
    - Lowering the y-coordinate of this segment can avoid collision with obstacle 12.

Considering this, a revised path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),      # Start point

    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:29:50 AM] The initial path was trying to be efficient but intersected multiple obstacles. Let's break down the path and adjust it to navigate the environment safely:

1. **Starting Point:**  The initial point (0.5, 3.5) is good.

2. **Initial Downward Movement:**  Moving directly down to (0.5, 0.5) is blocked by obstacles 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  We need to navigate around this obstacle cluster.

3. **Navigating the Obstacles:** 
    -  We can move right, going around the right side of obstacles 1, 6, and 7.
    -  Then, move upwards, staying clear of obstacles 2, 8, and 10. 

4. **Approaching the Goal:**  From a position above obstacle 2, we can move right, carefully avoiding obstacle 12, and finally down into the goal region.

**Corrected Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),   # Start
    (3.5, 3.5),   # Move right, above obstacles 1, 6, 7
    (3.5, 4.25),  # Move up, clearing obstacle 2 
    (6.5, 4.25)   # Move right to the goal
]

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:29:58 AM] The previous path failed due to several intersections with obstacles and not ending in the goal set. Let's analyze the environment and devise a new path:

1. **Starting Point:** We can keep the starting point at (0.5, 3.5) as it lies within the start set.

2. **Navigating Obstacles:**
    * Obstacles 3, 4, 5, and 8 form a barrier in the direct path towards the goal.
    * We need to move upwards to bypass these obstacles. 
    * A safe passage seems to be between Obstacles 2 and 8.

3. **Reaching the Goal:**
    * Once past Obstacle 2, we can move right towards the goal set.
    * We need to ensure our path doesn't intersect with Obstacle 12.

Based on this analysis, here's a possible path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),    # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 4.25),   # Move upwards to bypass the lower obstacles
    (3.25, 4.25),  # Move right, staying clear of Obstacle 8
    (3.25, 4.75),  # Move upwards to be closer to the goal and avoid Obstacle 12
    (6.5, 4.75)   # Move right towards the center of the goal set
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles and successfully reaches the goal set.

[08/22/2024 10:30:05 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 12. To achieve this, we can add a waypoint to navigate around the obstacle.

1. **Original Path Issue:** The segment from (3.25, 4.75) to (6.5, 4.75) crosses Obstacle 12.

2. **Identifying a Safe Passage:** We can route the path below Obstacle 12.

3. **Introducing a New Waypoint:**  A new waypoint can be added at (3.25, 2.5). This waypoint allows the path to move downwards, clear of Obstacle 12, and then proceed towards the goal.

4. **Connecting to the Goal:** From (3.25, 2.5), we can move directly right to reach the goal set without intersecting any obstacles. 

Here is the adjusted path:

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:30:15 AM] The original path has several intersections with the obstacles. Let's analyze the environment and come up with a safer path:

1. **Initial Path Analysis:** The first part of the path seems fine, reaching (3.25, 4.25) avoids the initial obstacles. The problem arises when trying to go down directly.

2. **Identifying Problem Areas:** Segments 3 and 4 are the problematic ones. Segment 3 collides with Obstacle 2, and Segment 4 crosses Obstacles 7, 10, and 12.

3. **Finding a Safe Passage:**  We need to navigate around these obstacles. 

4. **Adjusting the Path:**

    * From (3.25, 4.25), instead of going straight down, let's move further right to (5.5, 4.25), staying clear of Obstacle 2.
    * Next,  we can safely move down to (5.5, 2.5), avoiding Obstacles 10 and 12. 
    * Finally, move left to (6.5, 2.5) and then up to (6.5, 4.75) to reach the goal set, bypassing Obstacle 7.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5), 
    (0.5, 4.25), 
    (3.25, 4.25), 
    (5.5, 4.25),
    (5.5, 2.5),
    (6.5, 2.5),
    (6.5, 4.75) 
]
```

This new path avoids all the obstacles while successfully connecting the start and goal sets.

[08/22/2024 10:30:21 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid crossing obstacle 12. To achieve this, we can add a waypoint that goes around the obstacle.

[08/22/2024 10:30:30 AM] The path collides with Obstacle 12 because it tries to go directly from (5.5, 2.5) to (6.5, 2.5).  To avoid this, we can route the path upwards before reaching the x-coordinate of Obstacle 12, allowing it to move around the obstacle.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5), 
    (0.5, 4.25), 
    (3.25, 4.25), 
    (5.5, 4.25),

    (6.5, 3.5),  # Move rightwards 
    (6.5, 4.75)   # Move upwards to the goal 
]
```

This path first moves up to y = 4.25 to avoid early obstacles. Then, instead of going directly right at y = 2.5, it moves right at y = 3.5,  bypassing Obstacle 12 entirely. Finally, it reaches the goal position.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:30:38 AM] The feedback correctly identifies the intersection between the path segment from (5.5, 3.5) to (6.5, 3.5) and Obstacle 12. To avoid this, the path needs to be adjusted.

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Current Issue:** The segment (5.5, 3.5) to (6.5, 3.5) tries to cut directly across the environment, hitting Obstacle 12.

2. **Observation:** There's a clear vertical channel between Obstacles 10 and 12. 

3. **Solution:**  Instead of moving directly towards the goal, we can re-route the path to utilize this channel. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),      # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 4.25),     # Move up, avoiding initial obstacles
    (3.25, 4.25),    # Move right, staying above obstacles
    (5.5, 4.25),    # Approach the channel between obstacles
    (5.5, 2.5),     # Move down through the channel (between Obstacles 10 and 12)
    (6.5, 2.5),     # Move right, staying clear of Obstacle 12
    (6.5, 4.75)      # Move up into the goal set
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles and successfully reaches the goal set.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.

[08/22/2024 10:30:44 AM] The path intersects with Obstacle 12 because it tries to go straight from (5.5, 2.5) to (6.5, 2.5). To avoid this, we can make the path move upwards before reaching x-coordinate 6.

[08/22/2024 10:30:52 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid intersecting Obstacle 12. To achieve this, we can add a waypoint that goes around the obstacle.

Analyzing the path and the obstacle: 
    - The problematic segment is between (5.75, 3.5) and (6.5, 4.75).
    - Obstacle 12 spans from x=5.9 to x=6.0 and from y=2.0 to y=5.0. 

To circumvent Obstacle 12, we can route the path to the left of the obstacle.

Here's the adjusted path:
