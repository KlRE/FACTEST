# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data

[08/22/2024 10:38:15 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 12. To achieve this, we can add a waypoint that goes around the obstacle.

1. **Current Issue:** The problematic segment is (2.5, 4.75) to (6.5, 4.75). This line intersects with Obstacle 12, which spans from x = 5.9 to x = 6.0 at y = 4.75.

2. **Solution:** To avoid this, we can route the path above Obstacle 12. 

3. **New Waypoint:**  Let's add a waypoint at (2.5, 5.25) to first move above the obstacle.

4. **Path Adjustment:** From (2.5, 5.25), we can move directly to the goal set.

**Here's the corrected path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5), 
    (0.5, 4.25), 
    (2.5, 4.25),
    (2.5, 5.25),  # New waypoint to move above Obstacle 12
    (6.5, 4.75)   # Continue to the goal 
]

[08/22/2024 10:38:23 AM] The path needs adjustments to avoid the reported obstacles. 

1. **Segment 3 Issue:** The segment (2.5, 4.25) to (2.5, 5.25) crosses the top boundary wall (Obstacle 17). We need to route the path around this.

2. **Segment 4 Issue:** The segment (2.5, 5.25) to (6.5, 4.75) has two problems. It crosses both the top boundary wall (Obstacle 17) again and Obstacle 12. 

**Solution:**

1.  **Navigate Below Obstacles:** Instead of going above obstacles, let's try a path that stays below Obstacle 2 and navigates to the goal from there.

2.  **New Waypoints:**

    *   From the start, we can move to the right, staying below Obstacle 2.
    *   Then, we can move upwards towards the goal, making sure to stay to the left of Obstacle 12.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),  
    (4.8, 3.5), 
    (4.8, 4.25), 
    (6.5, 4.75)  
] 
```

This new path aims to stay clear of the problematic obstacles by taking a route below the initial attempted path.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:38:34 AM] The initial path has several intersections with obstacles. Let's analyze each segment and make adjustments:

**Segment 1:** (0.5, 3.5) to (4.8, 3.5) intersects Obstacle 8. 
   -  We need to route the path around Obstacle 8. Since there's a clear path above this obstacle, let's adjust the path to go upward first.

**Segment 2:** (4.8, 3.5) to (4.8, 4.25) intersects Obstacle 2. 
   - We've already decided to move upward before, so this segment should be safe now.

**Segment 3:** (4.8, 4.25) to (6.5, 4.75) intersects Obstacle 12.
    -  We can bypass this obstacle by moving further to the right before heading towards the goal.

Considering these adjustments, the new path could be:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),    # Start point
    (0.5, 4.25),   # Move upward, clearing Obstacle 8 
    (5.5, 4.25),   # Move right, clearing Obstacle 2
    (6.5, 4.75)    # Move to the goal point
] 
```

This path avoids all the obstacles while staying within the start and goal sets.

[08/22/2024 10:38:43 AM] The original path crosses obstacle 12 because the line segment connecting (5.5, 4.25) and (6.5, 4.75) cuts through the top-left corner of the obstacle. 

To avoid this, we can adjust the path to go around the obstacle. Since the obstacle extends downwards from the top of the environment, it's easier to navigate around it from below. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),    # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 2.5),    # Move downwards to avoid obstacle clusters
    (5.5, 2.5),    # Move rightwards, staying below obstacle clusters
    (6.5, 4.75)   # Move upwards to reach the goal set
]
```

**Explanation of changes:**

1. **(0.5, 2.5):**  This waypoint ensures a clear path downwards, avoiding the congestion of obstacles 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8.
2. **(5.5, 2.5):** This waypoint maintains a safe distance below obstacle 12 and positions the path for a final approach to the goal. 

This new path stays clear of all obstacles while successfully connecting the start and goal sets.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:38:53 AM] The initial path was attempting to be efficient by directly moving towards the goal. However, this led to collisions with multiple obstacles. Let's break down the path adjustments:

1. **Segment 1 (Start to Obstacle Clearance):**  Instead of going directly towards the right, we need to navigate around obstacles 3, 4, and 5. A good strategy is to first move downwards to a y-coordinate of 2, clearing those obstacles.  We'll aim for a point slightly to the right (x=0.6) to prepare for the next leg. 

2. **Segment 2 (Navigating the Corridor):** With the initial obstacles cleared, there's a clear path between obstacle groups (3,4,5) and (7,8). We can move rightwards along the y-coordinate of 2. Let's target  x-coordinate 3.8, staying clear of obstacle 7.

3. **Segment 3 (Maneuvering Around Obstacles 8 and 10):** To avoid obstacles 8 and 10, we need to move upwards. Aiming for a point between obstacles 8 and 10 with an x-coordinate of 3.8 and a y-coordinate of 4.25 should work.

4. **Segment 4 (Final Approach to Goal):** Now clear of major obstacles, we can proceed almost directly to the goal. 

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),   # Start point 
    (0.6, 2.0),   # Move down, clearing obstacles 3, 4, 5 
    (3.8, 2.0),   # Move right in the corridor
    (3.8, 4.25),  # Move upwards, navigating between obstacles 8 and 10
    (6.5, 4.75)   # Final approach to the goal point

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:39:02 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate directly towards the goal, resulting in collisions with several obstacles. 

To correct this, let's break down the path and find a way around the obstacles:

1. **Initial segment:** Starting at (0.5, 3.5) is fine.

2. **Avoiding Obstacles 3, 5, and 6:** Instead of moving directly right at a y-coordinate of 2.0, we need to navigate above these obstacles. We can do this by first moving right to a point (1.5, 3.5) which is clear of Obstacle 3, 4, and 5. 

3. **Avoiding Obstacles 2 and 6:** From (1.5, 3.5),  we can proceed rightwards to (3.5, 3.5) avoiding Obstacle 8, then further right to (4.5, 3.5) staying clear of Obstacle 2.  

4. **Avoiding Obstacle 12:** Finally, we can move up to (4.5, 4.75) bypassing Obstacle 12 and then proceed right to reach the goal area at (6.5, 4.75).

Therefore, the corrected path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5), 
    (1.5, 3.5), 
    (3.5, 3.5), 
    (4.5, 3.5),

[08/22/2024 10:39:21 AM] The initial path has intersections with obstacles 2, 8, and 12. Let's adjust the path to navigate around these obstacles:

1. **Obstacle 8:** The segment from (1.5, 3.5) to (3.5, 3.5) intersects Obstacle 8. To avoid this, we can route the path downwards, going around Obstacle 8. 

2. **Obstacle 2:** The segment from (4.5, 3.5) to (4.5, 4.75) intersects Obstacle 2.  We can bypass this by moving further right before going upwards, ensuring we clear the top-left corner of Obstacle 2.

3. **Obstacle 12:**  The segment from (4.5, 4.75) to (6.5, 4.75) intersects Obstacle 12. To avoid this, we can route the path upwards, going around the top-right corner of Obstacle 12.

Therefore, a corrected path could be:

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:39:34 AM] The original path was trying to be efficient by minimizing turns, but it led to collisions with obstacles. The modifications will focus on navigating around the obstacles by introducing additional waypoints to maneuver around problematic areas.

1. **Segment 2 Collision (Obstacle 4):**  To avoid Obstacle 4, the path needs to go around it to the right. We can add a waypoint before reaching the obstacle and another one after to guide the path around it.

2. **Segment 3 Collision (Obstacle 5):**  Similar to Obstacle 4, we need to guide the path around Obstacle 5. We can reuse the waypoint added after Obstacle 4 and add another one further right to create a clear path.

3. **Segment 5 Collision (Obstacle 10):** Obstacle 10 is blocking the direct path. We need to navigate above it. We can add a waypoint above the obstacle to guide the path.

4. **Segment 6 Collision (Obstacle 17):** Obstacle 17 is blocking the direct approach to the goal set. The path can be adjusted to move slightly to the right to avoid the obstacle.

Here's the modified path with added waypoints:

```python
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),     # Start in the start set 
    (1.5, 3.5),     # Same as before
    (1.5, 2.75),    # Adjusted to avoid Obstacle 4
    (2.25, 2.75),   # Added to guide the path around Obstacle 4 and 5
    (3.5, 2.75),    # Added to guide the path around Obstacle 5
    (3.5, 3.5),     # Same as before
    (5.5, 3.5),     # Same as before
    (5.5, 4.25),    # Adjusted to avoid Obstacle 10 
    (5.75, 4.25),   # Added to avoid Obstacle 17
    (5.75, 5.25),   # Adjusted to avoid Obstacle 17
    (6.5, 5.25),    # Same as before
    (6.5, 4.75)     # End inside the goal set
]
```

This new path addresses the collisions identified in the feedback and provides a clear path from the start to the goal set while avoiding all obstacles.

]

[08/22/2024 10:39:48 AM] The original path fails to avoid several obstacles. Here's a breakdown of the changes required, and a proposed new path:

**Analysis of Issues:**

* **Segment 2 & 3:**  The path tries to go straight down, hitting obstacles 4 and 5. It needs to navigate around these by moving further to the right before descending.
* **Segment 6:** The path collides with the top corner of Obstacle 10. Moving the waypoint slightly up (y > 4) would solve this.
* **Segment 9:** This segment crosses the very top edge of Obstacle 17. A slight shift to the right (x > 6) will fix this.

**Proposed Path & Rationale**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),       # Start point (unchanged)
    (2.5, 3.5),       # Move right, clear of obstacles 3, 4, 5 
    (2.5, 2.25),      # Move down, clear of obstacles 5, 6
    (3.5, 2.25),      # Move right, staying clear of obstacle 7 
    (3.5, 4.25),      # Move up, clearing obstacle 8 and above obstacle 10
    (5.5, 4.25),      # Move right, staying above obstacles 10 and below 12
    (6.25, 4.25),     # Move slightly right to avoid edge of Obstacle 17
    (6.25, 4.75)      # Move down into the goal set 
] 
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Initial Rightward Movement:**  Moving right to x=2.5 initially provides ample space to navigate around the cluster of obstacles 3, 4, 5, and 6.
2. **Staying Clear of Obstacles 7 & 8:** The path dips down and then right, maintaining a safe distance from obstacles 7 and 8. 
3. **Above Obstacle 10:** By moving up to y=4.25, the path clears the corner of obstacle 10.
4. **Final Approach:** The path moves right, staying above obstacle 10 and then slightly adjusts to the right to ensure a clear entry into the goal set without touching obstacle 17. 

**Note:** This path prioritizes clarity and safety.  A more sophisticated pathfinding algorithm might find a slightly shorter route.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:40:01 AM] The initial path was a good attempt, but it intersected with two obstacles: Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 12.

* **Segment 4 (Intersection with Obstacle 2):** This segment goes vertically from (3.5, 2.25) to (3.5, 4.25), colliding with Obstacle 2, which occupies the space roughly between x-coordinates 1 and 5 and y-coordinates 3.9 and 4.  To avoid this, we can make the path move to the right before going up, steering clear of Obstacle 2.

* **Segment 6 (Intersection with Obstacle 12):** This segment goes horizontally from (5.5, 4.25) to (6.25, 4.25), clashing with Obstacle 12. Obstacle 12 is a thin obstacle spanning from y-coordinate 2 to 5 at x-coordinate 5.9 to 6. To circumvent this, we can slightly adjust the path downwards to pass below Obstacle 12.

Considering these points, the adjusted path is as follows:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),        # Start
    (2.5, 3.5),        # Move right
    (2.5, 2.25),       # Move down
    (3.75, 2.25),      # Move right to clear Obstacle 2
    (3.75, 4.25),      # Move up 
    (5.5, 4.25),      # Move right 
    (5.5, 4.0),        # Move down to clear Obstacle 12
    (6.25, 4.0),       # Move right
    (6.25, 4.75)        # Move up to end within the goal region
]
```

This revised path successfully navigates the obstacles to reach the goal.

]

[08/22/2024 10:40:10 AM] The path has two obstacles, so we need to adjust the path to avoid them. 

**Segment 4:** This segment collides with Obstacle 2 because it attempts to go straight up from a low y-value. We can fix this by routing the path around the right side of Obstacle 2.

**Segment 7:** This segment collides with Obstacle 12 for a similar reason - it tries to move directly to the goal from a low y-value. We can fix this by having the path go above Obstacle 12.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),    
    (2.5, 3.5),   
    (2.5, 2.25),

[08/22/2024 10:40:22 AM] The initial path has several intersections with obstacles. Let's analyze each problematic segment and find alternative routes:

**Segment 4 ( (3.75, 2.25) to (3.75, 1.5) )**

This segment collides with Obstacle 6.  We need to route the path around this obstacle. We can do this by adding a waypoint to the right of Obstacle 6, allowing the path to go around it.

**Segment 5 ( (3.75, 1.5) to (5.5, 1.5) )**

This segment intersects Obstacle 7. Since we added a waypoint to the right of Obstacle 6 in the previous step, we can adjust the path to go downwards and then rightwards, avoiding Obstacle 7 completely.

**Segment 6 ( (5.5, 1.5) to (5.5, 5.25) )**

This segment has two intersections: Obstacles 11 and 17. We can address this by routing the path further to the right, avoiding both obstacles. We'll need to add a waypoint to achieve this.

Considering these adjustments, here's a possible revised path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),      # Start
    (2.5, 3.5),      # Same as before
    (2.5, 2.25),     # Same as before
    (4.25, 2.25),    # Go right to clear Obstacle 6
    (4.25, 1.25),    # Go down, clearing Obstacle 7
    (5.75, 1.25),    # Go right, clearing Obstacle 11
    (5.75, 5.25),    # Go up, clearing Obstacle 17
    (6.25, 5.25),    # Same as before 
    (6.25, 4.75)     # End 
]
```

This revised path avoids all the obstacles while staying within the start and goal sets.

        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:40:32 AM] The initial path had a few intersections with obstacles, so adjustments need to be made:

- **Segment 3:** The path goes directly from (2.5, 2.25) to (4.25, 2.25), crossing obstacle 7.  To avoid this, we can route the path downwards, going around the obstacle. 
- **Segment 6:** This segment goes directly from (5.75, 1.25) to (5.75, 5.25), intersecting obstacles 11 and 17. To fix this, we can route the path left, then upwards to reach the goal set.

Taking these points into consideration, here's a revised path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),     # Start Point
    (2.5, 3.5),     # Move Right
    (2.5, 1.5),     # Move Down, clearing Obstacle 7 
    (4.25, 1.5),    # Move Right
    (4.25, 1.25),   # Move slightly Down
    (5.25, 1.25),   # Move Right, approaching Obstacle 11
    (5.25, 5.25),   # Move Up, clearing Obstacles 11 and 17
    (6.25, 5.25),   # Move Right 
    (6.25, 4.75)    # Move Down to End Point

[08/22/2024 10:40:42 AM] The initial path has several intersections with obstacles. Here's how to adjust it:

1. **Segment 2 Intersection:** Segment 2 from (2.5, 3.5) to (2.5, 1.5) cuts through Obstacle 6. To avoid this, we can route the path to the right of Obstacle 6.

2. **Segment 3 Intersection:**  Segment 3 from (2.5, 1.5) to (4.25, 1.5) goes through Obstacle 7. We need to route the path below Obstacle 7.

3. **Segment 6 Intersection:** Segment 6 from (5.25, 1.25) to (5.25, 5.25) intersects with both Obstacle 11 and Obstacle 17. To avoid this, we can guide the path to the left of these obstacles.

**Modified Path:**

new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),   # Start within the start set
    (2.5, 3.5),   # Continue as before
    (2.5, 1.25),  # Move down, clearing Obstacle 6
    (4.25, 1.25), # Move right, clearing Obstacle 7
    (4.25, 5.25), # Move up, staying left of Obstacles 11 & 17
    (6.25, 5.25), # Move right towards the goal 
    (6.25, 4.75)  # Finish within the goal set

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:40:52 AM] The original path has several intersections with obstacles, so we need to adjust it. 

1. **Segment 2 Intersection (with Obstacle 6):** The path goes directly down from (2.5, 3.5) to (2.5, 1.25), crossing Obstacle 6. We can circumvent this by going left before descending, navigating around Obstacle 6.

2. **Segment 3 Intersection (with Obstacle 7):**  The path goes right from (2.5, 1.25) to (4.25, 1.25), intersecting Obstacle 7.  We should route the path below Obstacles 6 and 7.

3. **Segment 4 Intersection (with Obstacles 2 and 17):** This segment rises vertically, colliding with Obstacles 2 and 17. We need to reroute the path to the right before going upwards, to avoid these obstacles. 

Taking these points into consideration, here is a revised path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),      # Start
    (1.5, 3.5),      # Move right to avoid Obstacle 8
    (1.5, 1.0),      # Move down, clearing Obstacles 6 and 7
    (5.75, 1.0),     # Move right, staying below Obstacles 2, 10, 11, and 12
    (5.75, 4.75)     # Move up to the goal 
]
```

This revised path avoids all known obstacles and reaches the goal.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:41:01 AM] The previous path had several intersections with the obstacles.  Let's analyze the environment and find a safer route:

1. **Starting Point:** We can keep the starting point at (0.5, 3.5) as it's safely within the start set.

2. **Navigating Obstacles:** 
    - We need to navigate around Obstacle groups 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 to reach the right side of the environment.
    -  We can achieve this by moving rightward, staying above these obstacles (y > 3.5).

3. **Reaching the Goal:**
    - Once we are past the obstacles around x = 4, we can safely move downwards towards the goal set.

4. **Adjusting for Safety:**
    - To ensure a safe distance from obstacles, we will adjust the x-coordinates of our waypoints slightly.

Based on this analysis, here's the updated path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),   # Start
    (4.25, 3.5),  # Move right, staying clear of obstacle groups
    (4.25, 4.75), # Move down towards the goal set
    (6.5,  4.75)   # Move right into the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:41:07 AM] The previous path went through obstacles because it didn't account for their positions. To fix this, the path needs to navigate around the obstacles:

1. **Start:** (0.5, 3.5) is fine as a starting point.
2. **Navigate Right:**  To avoid Obstacle 8, the path needs to move above it. A waypoint at (0.5, 4.25) achieves this.
3. **Continue Right:** The path can then proceed right, clearing Obstacle 2, towards the goal. A waypoint at (6.5, 4.25) positions it for the final descent. 
4. **Descend to Goal:** Finally, the path can move down to (6.5, 4.75), which lies within the goal area.

**New Path:**

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.6, 3.6], [0.4, 3.6], [0.4, 3.4], [0.6, 3.4]]

    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:41:13 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid Obstacle 12. Looking at the environment, it's clear we need to route the path below Obstacle 12 to reach the goal.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),   # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 1.5),   # Move downwards to a point below all obstacles
    (6.5, 1.5),   # Move rightwards, staying below Obstacle 12
    (6.5, 4.75)   # Move upwards to end within the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Downward Movement:** The second waypoint is shifted downwards to (0.5, 1.5) to navigate below all the obstacles. 
2. **Horizontal Movement:** The third waypoint (6.5, 1.5) maintains the y-coordinate to avoid Obstacle 12 while moving right towards the goal.
3. **Upward Movement:**  The final waypoint remains unchanged, moving upwards to reach the goal set.

[08/22/2024 10:41:21 AM] The initial path failed because it intersected with Obstacle 7. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate above this obstacle. 

Here's a possible adjustment:

1. **Start:** Keep the starting point (0.5, 3.5).
2. **Go Right:** Instead of going down directly, move right towards the right edge of Obstacle 8, let's say to point (3.1, 3.5). 
3. **Go Down:** Now safely navigate downwards to a point below all obstacles but above Obstacle 9, for example, (3.1, 1.5).
4. **Proceed to Goal:**  Finally, move right towards the goal, reaching (6.5, 1.5) and ultimately ending at (6.5, 4.75) within the goal set.

This adjusted path avoids all obstacles while still reaching the goal.

Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/22/2024 10:41:28 AM] The initial path goes through obstacles 6 and 8. To correct this, the path needs to navigate around these obstacles. 

1. **Starting Point:** We can keep the starting point at (0.5, 3.5).

2. **Navigating Obstacles:**
    - To avoid Obstacles 8 and 6, we can first move rightwards to x-coordinate 2.5, staying clear of Obstacle 8. 
    - Then, we can move downwards to y-coordinate 2.5, safely passing above Obstacle 6.

3. **Reaching the Goal:**
    - From (2.5, 2.5), we can move rightwards to x-coordinate 6.5, avoiding Obstacle 7.
    - Finally, we can move upwards to reach the goal point at (6.5, 4.75).

Therefore, the corrected path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),  
    (2.5, 3.5), 
    (2.5, 2.5),  
    (6.5, 2.5),  
    (6.5, 4.75)  
]
```
