# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.6, 3.6], [0.4, 3.6], [0.4, 3.4], [0.6, 3.4]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[6.75, 5.0], [6.25, 5.0], [6.25, 4.5], [6.75, 4.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[3.0, 1.0], [1.0, 1.0], [1.0, 0.9], [3.0, 0.9]]

			Obstacle 12: [[6.0, 5.0], [5.9, 5.0], [5.9, 2.0], [6.0, 2.0]]
			Obstacle 13: [[5.0, 1.0], [4.9, 1.0], [4.9, -0.0], [5.0, -0.0]]

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:31:20 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid Obstacle 7. One way to do this is to route the path above Obstacle 7. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),   # Start in the start set
    (0.5, 4.0),   # Move upward, clearing the top of Obstacle 7 
    (6.5, 4.0),   # Move rightward, staying above Obstacle 7
    (6.5, 4.75)   # Move down to the end point within the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(0.5, 3.5):**  Starting point within the start set.
2. **(0.5, 4.0):** Move up to a y-coordinate of 4.0. This ensures a safe distance above Obstacle 7, which extends only to y = 3.0.
3. **(6.5, 4.0):**  Move rightward while maintaining a y-coordinate of 4.0, staying clear of Obstacle 7.

### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:31:28 AM] The initial path attempted to move horizontally across the top of the obstacles. However, there are several obstacles clustered around the y = 4.0 line. 

To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around these obstacles.  One strategy is to move upwards, clear of obstacle 2, then proceed rightwards before descending to the goal.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),   # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 4.2),   # Move upwards, clearing obstacle 2 and 8
    (2.5, 4.2),   # Move right, staying clear of obstacle 8
    (2.5, 5.2),   # Move upwards, clearing obstacle 12 
    (6.5, 5.2),   # Move right, reaching the goal area
    (6.5, 4.75)   # Move down into the goal set
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles by:

1. **Initial Upward Movement:** Moving to y=4.2 clears obstacles 2 and 8.
2. **Lateral Movement:** Moving right at y=4.2 avoids obstacle 8.
3. **Second Upward Movement:** Moving to y=5.2 clears obstacle 12.
4. **Final Approach:** Moving right at y=5.2 and then down to y=4.75 reaches the goal set safely.

[08/22/2024 10:31:37 AM] The path segment between (2.5, 4.2) and (2.5, 5.2) crosses obstacle 17 which spans the entire width of the environment. To avoid this, we need to route the path around the left side of obstacle 17. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),    # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 4.2),    # Move upward, clearing the start set
    (2.5, 4.2),    # Move rightward 
    (2.5, 4.8),    # Move upward, staying below obstacle 17
    (6.5, 4.8),    # Move rightward, passing below obstacle 17 
    (6.5, 4.75)   # Move slightly downward to end within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Added Waypoint (2.5, 4.8):** This waypoint is crucial for navigating below obstacle 17. Instead of going directly upward from (2.5, 4.2) to (2.5, 5.2), we stop at (2.5, 4.8) to avoid a collision.

2. **Modified Waypoint (6.5, 5.2) to (6.5, 4.8):**  To maintain a straight line after avoiding obstacle 17, we move horizontally to the right at a y-coordinate of 4.8, which is still below obstacle 17. 

This new path successfully navigates the environment while adhering to the non-crossing constraints.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:31:46 AM] The feedback correctly identifies that the provided path intersects with Obstacle 12. To address this, the path needs to be adjusted to go around this obstacle. 

Here's a possible adjusted path and the thought process:

1. **Original path until the problematic segment:** Keep the initial part of the path the same: [(0.5, 3.5), (0.5, 4.2), (2.5, 4.2), (2.5, 4.8)].

2. **Circumventing Obstacle 12:**  
    - Instead of going directly to (6.5, 4.8),  navigate below Obstacle 12.
    - Add a waypoint at (2.5, 2.5) to move downwards.
    - Add another waypoint at (6.5, 2.5) to move rightwards, safely below Obstacle 12. 

3. **Reaching the goal:** 
    -  Finally, add a waypoint (6.5, 4.75) to move upwards and reach the goal set.

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 3.5), (0.5, 4.2), (2.5, 4.2), (2.5, 4.8), (2.5, 2.5), (6.5, 2.5), (6.5, 4.75)]

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:32:00 AM] The feedback correctly identifies the obstacle collisions in the original path. Let's analyze the situation and adjust the path:

1. **Segment 4 Collision ( (2.5, 4.8) to (2.5, 2.5) ):**  This segment goes straight down and collides with Obstacle 2.  We need to navigate around Obstacle 2 to proceed downward.

2. **Segment 5 Collision ( (2.5, 2.5) to (6.5, 2.5) ):** This horizontal segment collides with Obstacles 7, 10, and 12.  We need to find a way to move to the right that avoids these obstacles.

**Revised Path Strategy:**

* **Initial Maneuvering:** The first three waypoints ( (0.5, 3.5), (0.5, 4.2), (2.5, 4.2) ) are fine as they successfully position us to the right of Obstacles 3, 4, and 5. 

* **Navigating Downwards:** Instead of going straight down from (2.5, 4.2), we need to navigate around Obstacle 2. We can do this by moving right to a point like (5.5, 4.2) which is clear of Obstacle 2, and then going downwards.

* **Avoiding Obstacle Cluster:**  From our lower position, we need to navigate carefully around the cluster of Obstacles 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 12. A safe route is to hug the bottom edge of Obstacle 6, then move right towards the goal.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),   
    (0.5, 4.2),  
    (2.5, 4.2), 
    (5.5, 4.2),   # Move right to clear Obstacle 2
    (5.5, 1.8),   # Move down, clear of Obstacle 2 
    (4.1, 1.8),   # Hug the bottom of Obstacle 6 
    (6.5, 1.8),   # Move right towards the goal
    (6.5, 4.75)   # Move up into the goal set
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

*   Added waypoints to navigate around Obstacle 2 by moving right before descending.
*   Added waypoints to hug the bottom edge of Obstacle 6 and then move right, avoiding the obstacle cluster. 

This new path should successfully avoid all obstacles and reach the goal set.

[08/22/2024 10:32:21 AM] The path intersects with obstacle 11 because segment 4 goes right through it. To fix this, the path needs to move to the left or right of obstacle 11. 

Since the goal is to the right and there is space, the path should move to the right of obstacle 11. 

To navigate around obstacle 11, I will add a waypoint to the right of it before continuing the path towards the goal.

Here's the updated path:

[08/22/2024 10:32:31 AM] The path needs adjustments to avoid obstacles 11 and 12. 

- The segment from (5.5, 4.2) to (6.2, 4.2) is too close to obstacle 12.
- The segment from (6.2, 4.2) to (5.5, 1.5) crosses both obstacles 11 and 12.

Therefore, instead of going directly towards the goal, it's better to navigate below obstacles 11 and 12:

1. **From (2.5, 4.2) move further right to (4.5, 4.2) to avoid early approach to obstacle 12.**
2. **Then, navigate down to (4.5, 1.5) which puts us safely below obstacles 11 and 12.**
3. **From there, it's safe to move right to (6.5, 1.5).**
4. **Finally, go up to reach the goal at (6.5, 4.75).**

[08/22/2024 10:32:39 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid intersecting Obstacle 2. Currently, the path tries to go down from (4.5, 4.2) to (4.5, 1.5) which cuts through Obstacle 2. 

To fix this, we can route the path to the right of Obstacle 2. This can be achieved by adding a waypoint to the right of Obstacle 2 before going down.

Here's the updated path:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 3.5), (0.5, 4.2), (2.5, 4.2), (5.5, 4.2), (5.5, 1.5), (6.5, 1.5), (6.5, 4.75)]
```

Here's a breakdown of the changes:

- **Added Waypoint (5.5, 4.2):** This waypoint takes the path to the right of Obstacle 2.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:32:48 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid crossing Obstacle 11. To achieve this, we can add a waypoint to navigate around the obstacle. 

1. **Original problematic segment:** The segment connecting (5.5, 4.2) and (5.5, 1.5) cuts through Obstacle 11.
2. **Identifying a safe passage:** There's clear space to the left of Obstacle 11.
3. **Adding a waypoint:** We can route the path around the left side of Obstacle 11 by adding a waypoint at (4.5, 4.2). This maintains a safe distance.
4. **Connecting to the end:** The remaining path from (4.5, 4.2) to (6.5, 4.75) remains valid.

**New Path:**

[08/22/2024 10:33:07 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid the intersection with obstacles 2, 10 and 11. To achieve this, we can reroute the path by going below obstacle 2 instead of trying to move above it.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),  
    (0.5, 4.2),  
    (2.5, 4.2),  
    (2.5, 1.5), # move downwards to go below obstacle 2 
    (5.5, 1.5),  
    (6.5, 1.5),  
    (6.5, 4.75)
]
```

Here's the thought process behind this adjustment:

1. **Identifying the problem:** The original path intersects with obstacles when moving from (4.5, 4.2) to (5.5, 1.5). This segment attempts to cut across the space between obstacles 2, 10, and 11, leading to the intersection.
2. **Finding an alternative route:**  Instead of going above, we can reroute the path to go below obstacle 2. 
3. **Adjusting the path:** 
    * The segment (2.5, 4.2) to (2.5, 1.5) ensures a clear path below obstacle 2.  
    * The remaining segments are kept similar to the original path to reach the goal.

This new path avoids all obstacles while still adhering to the start and end set requirements.

### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:33:18 AM] The path needs adjustments to avoid obstacles 2 and 6. Here's a possible solution:

1. **Initial Segment:** The segment from (0.5, 3.5) to (0.5, 4.2) is fine as it stays within the start set and doesn't intersect any obstacles.

2. **Navigating Obstacles:** Instead of going straight down to (2.5, 1.5), we need to maneuver around obstacles 2 and 6. Here's a possible route:
    - From (0.5, 4.2), move right to (2.5, 4.2) staying clear of obstacle 2.
    - Move down to (2.5, 3.5), staying above obstacle 8.
    - Move right, carefully navigating between obstacles 6 and 8, reaching a point like (3.5, 3.5).
    - Now safely move down to (3.5, 1.5), clear of obstacle 6.

3. **Final Approach:** The remaining segments need slight adjustments:
    - From (3.5, 1.5) move right to (5.5, 1.5), staying clear of obstacle 7. 
    - The final segment (6.5, 1.5) to (6.5, 4.75) is fine as it goes straight into the goal set.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:33:30 AM] The initial path had several intersections with obstacles. To correct this, I analyzed the environment and identified safer routes. 

- **Segment 3:** Initially went from (2.5, 4.2) to (2.5, 3.5), intersecting Obstacle 2. To avoid this, I'm routing the path around the right side of Obstacle 2.
- **Segment 4:** Initially went from (2.5, 3.5) to (3.5, 3.5), intersecting Obstacle 8. I'm adjusting this segment to go downwards before Obstacle 8, then move right.
- **Segment 5:** Initially went from (3.5, 3.5) to (3.5, 1.5), intersecting Obstacle 6. This segment now needs to navigate between Obstacles 6 and 7. 
- **Segment 6:** Initially went from (3.5, 1.5) to (5.5, 1.5), intersecting Obstacle 7. This segment now needs to continue the path from the adjusted Segment 5.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),       # Start
    (0.5, 4.2),       # Upward movement remains
    (5.5, 4.2),       # Move right, staying above Obstacle 2 
    (5.5, 3.25),      # Move down, clearing Obstacle 8 
    (3.25, 3.25),     # Move left, before Obstacle 8
    (3.25, 2.5),     # Move down, navigating between Obstacles 6 and 7 
    (4.5, 2.5),       # Move right, clearing Obstacle 7
    (4.5, 1.5),       # Move down 
    (6.5, 1.5),       # Continue right
    (6.5, 4.75)       # Move up to the goal 
]
```

This new path aims to move around the obstacles in a way that avoids intersections.

[08/22/2024 10:33:40 AM] The path has two collisions that need to be addressed. 

1. **Segment 4:** The segment between (5.5, 3.25) and (3.25, 3.25) cuts through Obstacle 10. To avoid this, we can route the path downwards, go around Obstacle 10, and then continue horizontally.

2. **Segment 6:** The segment between (3.25, 2.5) and (4.5, 2.5) collides with Obstacle 7. We can bypass this by routing the path downwards, navigating below Obstacle 7, and then moving upwards again to continue the path.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:33:51 AM] The initial path went south and tried to weave between obstacles, resulting in collisions.  A better strategy is to initially head north and navigate above most of the obstacles.

Here's the updated path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),  # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 4.2),  # Continue moving upward to clear the start area
    (2.5, 4.2),  # Move right, staying clear of obstacles 2 and 8
    (2.5, 5.25), # Move upward, clearing obstacle 2
    (5.5, 5.25), # Move right, staying clear of obstacles 12 and 17
    (5.5, 4.75), # Move downward to enter the goal set
    (6.5, 4.75)   # End within the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Initial Upward Movement:**  Instead of immediately going south, the path now initially moves upward to (0.5, 4.2). This clears the starting area and provides a clearer path forward.
2. **Navigating Above Obstacles:** The path then moves right above obstacles 2 and 8, reaching (2.5, 4.2).  It then moves further upward to (2.5, 5.25), staying clear of obstacle 12.
3. **Moving towards the Goal:**  From there, the path proceeds right to (5.5, 5.25), remaining above obstacle 17. 
4. **Entering the Goal Set:** Finally, the path moves down to (5.5, 4.75) to enter the goal set and then right to (6.5, 4.75), ensuring it ends within the defined goal area. 

This new path avoids all obstacles while successfully connecting the start and goal sets.

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:33:58 AM] The original path fails to avoid the top boundary (Obstacle 17) as it moves to the right. Additionally, the final segment cuts through Obstacle 12.  

The path can be adjusted by:
1. **Moving higher:**  Increase the y-coordinate of waypoints 2 and 3 to go above obstacle 17.
2. **Adjusting the approach:** Instead of moving horizontally and then vertically towards the goal, approach the goal diagonally from above to avoid Obstacle 12. 

Here's the updated path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5), 
    (0.5, 5.5),  # Move higher to clear Obstacle 17
    (2.5, 5.5),  # Move higher to clear Obstacle 17

    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 10:34:04 AM] The initial path crosses Obstacle 17 because it attempts to move directly upwards from the start set. To avoid this, the path needs to first navigate to the right, clear of Obstacle 17, before proceeding upwards. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),   // Start within the start set
    (2.5, 3.5),   // Move right, staying clear of Obstacles 3, 4, 5, and 8
    (2.5, 5.5),   // Move upwards, now clear of Obstacle 17
    (6.5, 5.0)    // Move right to the goal set 
]
```

This path first moves right to a point where it's safe to move upwards without intersecting Obstacle 17. This demonstrates the importance of considering obstacle positions when planning paths and not just focusing on the shortest distance between the start and goal.

[08/22/2024 10:34:22 AM] The original path crosses obstacles as it goes directly upwards from the start set.  We need to find a way around obstacles 2 and 17 to reach the goal set. 

1. **Navigate around Obstacle 2:** We can achieve this by first moving to the right, staying clear of obstacle 2's left boundary. 
2. **Navigate around Obstacle 17:** After passing obstacle 2, we can safely move upwards, making sure to stay below obstacle 17.
3. **Proceed to the Goal:** Once we're clear of obstacle 17, we can move right towards the goal set.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),    # Start within the start set
    (5.5, 3.5),    # Move right, staying clear of obstacle 2

[08/22/2024 10:34:29 AM] The initial path intersects with obstacles 8 and 10 because it attempts to move directly rightwards at a y-coordinate of 3.5. To avoid this, the path needs to initially move upwards to a y-coordinate greater than 4.0 to clear those obstacles. 

Similarly, the initial path's attempt to move rightwards at a y-coordinate of 4.75 will intersect obstacle 12. Therefore, before moving rightwards, the path should move upwards to a y-coordinate greater than 5.0. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
