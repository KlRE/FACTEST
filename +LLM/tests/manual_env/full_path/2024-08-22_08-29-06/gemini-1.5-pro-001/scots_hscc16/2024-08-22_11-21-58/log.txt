# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

]

[08/22/2024 11:22:11 AM] The initial path has several intersections with the obstacles. Let's analyze each problematic segment and identify safer routes:

1. **Segment 2: (0.5, 5.5) to (3.0, 5.5)** collides with Obstacle 1. To avoid this, we can route the path upwards, going around Obstacle 1.

2. **Segment 4: (3.0, 2.5) to (9.5, 2.5)** has multiple collisions.  We can address this by navigating above the obstacles:
    - Move upwards from the starting point to a y-coordinate above all obstacles.
    - Traverse horizontally above the obstacles.
    - Move downwards towards the goal.

3. **Segment 5: (9.5, 2.5) to (9.5, 0.6)** collides with Obstacle 15.  Since the end goal is to be within the goal set, we can simply end the path before reaching Obstacle 15.

Considering these adjustments, here's a possible revised path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),     // Start within the start set
    (0.5, 9.5),     // Move upwards to clear all obstacles
    (9.0, 9.5),     // Move horizontally above the obstacles
    (9.0, 0.6)      // Move downwards to end within the goal set
]
```

This path avoids all the obstacles and successfully connects the start and goal sets. Remember to always visually verify the path to ensure it meets all the requirements.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:22:19 AM] The initial path failed to avoid obstacles and reach the goal set. Analyzing the environment's layout, we can devise a new path:

1. **Starting Point:** We keep the starting point at (0.5, 0.5) as it lies within the start set.

2. **Navigating Obstacles:** 
   -  We need to move upwards to avoid obstacles clustered at the bottom. A safe passage exists between Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 5. 
   -  Let's add a waypoint at (0.5, 6.5) to navigate above Obstacle 3. 

3. **Approaching the Goal:** 
   - Now we can move rightwards towards the goal. A clear path exists above Obstacle 8. 
   -  Let's add a waypoint at (7.5, 6.5) to position ourselves for the final approach.

4. **Reaching the Goal:**
   -  From here, we can move downwards to enter the goal set. 
   -  The final waypoint will be placed within the goal set at (9.5, 0.6).

**New Path:**
```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    
    (0.5, 6.5),
    (7.5, 6.5),
    (9.5, 0.6)
]
```

This new path addresses previous errors by maneuvering around obstacles and successfully terminating within the goal set.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:22:31 AM] The initial path goes directly across the center of the environment, causing collisions with several obstacles.  To correct this, the path needs to navigate around these obstacles more carefully. 

**Analyzing the Obstacles:**

* **Obstacles 1, 2, 3, 4:**  These obstacles form a wall blocking direct horizontal movement at the start. The path needs to move upward to go above these.
* **Obstacles 5, 8:** These obstacles extend downwards, limiting how high the path can go initially. A safe passage seems to be between Obstacles 3 and 5.
* **Obstacles 6, 7:**  These obstacles form another horizontal barrier.  However, there's a gap between Obstacles 6 and 8 that the path can utilize.
* **Obstacles 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14:** These obstacles cluster near the goal, limiting approach angles. The path needs to maneuver carefully to reach the goal set.

**Revised Path Strategy:**

1. **Ascend:** Start by moving upward from the start set to avoid the initial obstacle wall (Obstacles 1, 2, 3, 4). Aim for a point above Obstacle 3 but below Obstacle 5.
2. **Navigate Right:** Move rightward, passing through the gap between Obstacles 3 and 5.
3. **Pass Obstacles 6 & 7:** Continue moving right, passing through the gap between Obstacles 6 and 8.
4. **Descend:** Carefully descend towards the goal set, navigating around Obstacles 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start Point
    (0.5, 5.5),   # Ascend above Obstacles 1, 2, 3, 4
    (3.0, 5.5),   # Move right, between Obstacles 3 and 5
    (6.5, 5.5),   # Continue right, between Obstacles 6 and 8

[08/22/2024 11:22:39 AM] The initial path crosses multiple obstacles. To rectify this, I'll analyze the environment and plan a path that navigates around the obstacles.

1. **Start to Obstacle 1:** The first segment needs to clear Obstacle 1. I'll route the path above Obstacle 1.
2. **Obstacle 1 to Obstacle 3:** Between Obstacles 1 and 3 there's a narrow passage. To safely navigate this, I'll add a waypoint between them.
3. **Obstacle 3 to Obstacle 7:** Obstacles 3 and 7 form a channel. The path can proceed through this channel.
4. **Obstacle 7 to Obstacle 8:**  A gap exists between Obstacles 7 and 8. The path can pass through this gap.
5. **Obstacle 8 to Goal:**  The final segment needs to bypass Obstacle 8 and reach the goal. I'll route the path below Obstacle 8.

Considering these adjustments, the updated path is:

{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:22:51 AM] The original path has several intersections with obstacles. To address this, a new path needs to be planned that carefully navigates these obstacles:

1. **Starting Point:** We can keep the original starting point (0.5, 0.5).
2. **Avoiding Obstacles 1, 2, 3, and 4:** To avoid these initial obstacles, the path needs to move upwards before reaching x-coordinate 2. Since obstacle 3 extends to y=6, we need to move higher. A safe point to aim for is (1.75, 6.5).
3. **Navigating to the Right:** From (1.75, 6.5), we need to move towards the goal set.  A safe route is to go right, staying above obstacles 5 and 7 but below obstacle 10. We can achieve this by aiming for a point like (5.5, 8).
4. **Avoiding Obstacles 6 and 9:** From (5.5, 8), a direct path to the goal set is blocked by obstacles 6 and 9. To circumvent these, the path needs to dip below them. A safe passage is to aim for a point like (7.5, 0.5), staying clear of obstacle 9.
5. **Reaching the Goal Set:**  Finally, from (7.5, 0.5), the path can move rightward, avoiding obstacles 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15, and reach a suitable endpoint within the goal set, such as (9.5, 0.6).

Therefore, the new path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (1.75, 6.5),
    (5.5, 8), 
    (7.5, 0.5),

]

[08/22/2024 11:22:57 AM] The initial path fails because it intersects multiple obstacles. A new path needs to be devised that navigates the spaces between the obstacles. 

Starting from (0.5, 0.5), we can see a clear path upwards to the top of the obstacles, staying to the left of obstacle 1 and obstacle 3. A good waypoint for this would be (1.0, 10.5) - just above obstacle 3.

From (1.0, 10.5) we can move rightwards above all the obstacles. We can pass safely above obstacle 10 at (8.0, 10.5).

From here, we can descend downwards to the goal, passing to the right of obstacle 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. A good final waypoint before the goal would be (9.5, 0.6).

Therefore, a corrected path would be:

1. **Maintain Elevation:** Instead of directly moving down from (8.0, 10.5), we should maintain the y-coordinate to avoid Obstacle 9.
2. **Navigate Right:**  Continue moving rightwards towards the goal set, staying above Obstacle 12 and 14.
3. **Descend Carefully:** After safely passing Obstacle 14, descend to a point below Obstacle 12 but above Obstacle 15.
4. **Approach Goal:** Finally, move horizontally towards the goal set, ensuring to stay below Obstacle 11.

This strategy avoids all collisions and results in a viable path.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:23:14 AM] The initial path goes too far to the right and gets stuck behind obstacles. 

To fix this, I will adjust the path as follows:

1. **Navigate above Obstacles 1-4**: Instead of going right immediately, move upwards to a y-coordinate above all obstacles (e.g., y=10.5). This ensures a clear path initially.
2. **Maintain y-coordinate until past Obstacle 9**: Keep the y-coordinate at 10.5 until reaching an x-coordinate past Obstacle 9. This avoids all the vertically aligned obstacles.
3. **Descend to Goal**: After passing Obstacle 9, descend directly downwards to the goal set, ensuring the path stays clear of Obstacle 10 and the clusters of smaller obstacles.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   // Start within the start set
    (0.5, 10.5),  // Move up to a point above all obstacles
    (8.6, 10.5),  // Move right, staying above obstacles
    (8.6, 0.6)   // Move down to the goal set, avoiding obstacles
]
```

This revised path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles while successfully connecting the start and goal sets.

[08/22/2024 11:23:22 AM] The initial path was going vertically up and then trying to reach the goal. The problem is that there are obstacles blocking this direct path on the right side of the environment. 

To fix this, the path should be adjusted to first navigate around the leftmost obstacles, then proceed rightwards towards the goal.

Here's how the new path is constructed:

1. **Start:** (0.5, 0.5) - Remains the same, starting within the start set.
2. **Go Above Obstacles:** (0.5, 10.5) -  This waypoint remains unchanged to clear the initial obstacles.
3. **Navigate Left:** (2.0, 10.5) - Move left to a point that is clear of the obstacles on the right side.
4. **Move Right towards Goal:** (9.5, 10.5) -  Move right, staying above all obstacles. 
5. **Descend to Goal:** (9.5, 0.6) -  Move down to the level of the goal set.
6. **Enter Goal Set:** (9.5, 0.6) - Move right to end up within the goal set.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [

]

[08/22/2024 11:23:27 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid the obstacles near the goal set. The current final segment crosses obstacles 11, 13, and 15. 

To avoid this, we can add a waypoint to the left of the obstacles, allowing the path to move downward before reaching the goal set.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (0.5, 10.5), 
    (2.0, 10.5), 
    (9.5, 10.5),
    (8.0, 10.5),  # New waypoint to the left of the obstacles
    (9.5, 0.6) 
]
```

This new path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles while successfully navigating from the start to the goal set.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:23:35 AM] The initial path goes too far to the right before attempting to move to the goal, leading to collisions with obstacles 9, 12, and 14. To correct this, we'll keep the path primarily above the obstacles and then navigate to the goal set.

Here's a possible revised path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),     # Start within the start set.
    (0.5, 10.5),    # Move vertically upwards, staying clear of obstacles.
    (8.1, 10.5),    # Move horizontally above all obstacles.
    (8.1, 8.25),    # Move down to a position just above Obstacle 10.
    (9.5, 8.25),    # Move right, staying clear of Obstacle 10.
    (9.5, 0.6)      # Move down into the goal set.
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Stay Above Obstacles:** The path now primarily moves above all the obstacles to avoid any collisions.
2. **Strategic Descent:** The path descends strategically between obstacles 9 and 10 to reach the goal set.
3. **Clearance:** The path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles to ensure no collisions occur.

[08/22/2024 11:23:47 AM] The path was close to a good solution, but it had a few collisions. To fix this, I've made the following adjustments:

- **Segment 4 (Collision with Obstacle 9):** The original path directly connected (8.1, 8.25) to (9.5, 8.25), causing a collision with Obstacle 9. To avoid this, we'll add a waypoint that routes the path below Obstacle 9. 

- **Segment 5 (Collisions with Obstacles 11, 13, and 15):** The original path went straight down from (9.5, 8.25) to (9.5, 0.6), colliding with multiple obstacles. To fix this, I will route the path to the left of these obstacles.

Here's the updated path:

```

    (0.5, 10.5),

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:23:58 AM] The initial path collides with obstacles in two segments. To correct this, the path needs to be adjusted to navigate around obstacles 9 and 12. 

**Analysis:**

* **Segment 4:** The path attempts to move horizontally from (8.1, 10.5) to (9.25, 8.0). This crosses obstacle 9 which occupies the x-range from 8.2 to 8.4 at that y-level.
* **Segment 5:** Moving directly down from (9.25, 8.0) to (9.25, 0.6) intersects both obstacle 12 (y-range 5.9 to 6.1) and obstacle 14 (y-range 3.5 to 3.7). 

**Solution:**

1. **Bypass Obstacle 9:**  Instead of moving horizontally at y=8.0, the path can be adjusted to go below obstacle 9. Since obstacle 9's lowest point is y=0, the path can safely pass at y=0.5.
2. **Navigate Around Obstacles 12 & 14:**  Instead of moving straight down at x=9.25, the path needs to shift to the left to avoid obstacles 12 and 14.  A safe passage can be made by moving to x=8.1 (just to the left of obstacle 9) and then navigating down between the obstacles.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start in the start set
    (0.5, 10.5),   # Move up to avoid obstacles
    (8.1, 10.5),   # Move right, above obstacles
    (8.1, 0.5),    # Move down, clearing obstacle 9
    (8.1, 0.6)     # Move to the final y-position before entering the goal set
    (9.5, 0.6)      # Enter the goal set
] 
```

This new path successfully avoids all obstacles and reaches the goal set.

[08/22/2024 11:24:16 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 9. To achieve this, we can add a waypoint that goes around the obstacle. 

1. **Original problematic segment:** The segment (8.1, 0.6) to (9.5, 0.6) cuts through Obstacle 9.
2. **Identifying a safe passage:** There's enough space to go above Obstacle 9.
3. **Creating a new waypoint:** We can add a waypoint (8.1, 8.6) to guide the path above Obstacle 9.

Therefore, the corrected path is:

]

[08/22/2024 11:24:24 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with obstacles 11, 13, and 15. We can do this by routing the path around the left side of these obstacles. 

Here's the updated path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),       # Start in the start set
    (0.5, 10.5),      # Move upwards, same as before
    (8.1, 10.5),      # Move rightwards, same as before
    (8.1, 0.5),       # Move downwards, same as before
    (8.1, 8.6),       # Move upwards to previous position
    (8.1, 9.5),       # Move slightly upwards to avoid obstacle 10
    (9.1, 9.5),       # Move rightwards to a position left of the obstacles 
    (9.1, 0.6),       # Move downwards, staying left of the obstacles
    (9.5, 0.6)        # Move rightwards to end in the goal set
]
```

Here's why this works:

1. **Avoiding Obstacles 11, 13, 15:** By moving leftward before descending, the path avoids intersecting with the problematic obstacles. 
2. **Staying within Boundaries:** The new path remains within the free space and doesn't introduce any new collisions.

This revised path addresses the obstacle collision issue while maintaining the start and end points within their designated sets.

[08/22/2024 11:24:31 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid the obstacles it intersects with when moving from a point above the obstacles to a point below the obstacles. 

Instead of going straight down, the path can be modified to first move to the right, avoiding the obstacles, and then going down to the goal point.

Here's a possible updated path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),

]

[08/22/2024 11:24:41 AM] The issue is that the path tries to go around all the obstacles in one go, leading to a long vertical segment that intersects with several obstacles. 

To fix this, we can break down the path into smaller segments, navigating around obstacles more carefully:

1. **Initial path:** The path starts well, going above obstacles 1-3.

2. **Avoiding obstacles 11, 13, 15:** Instead of going straight down, we need to make a detour around these obstacles. 

3. **Reaching the goal:** After clearing the obstacles, we can proceed to the goal.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),       # Start point
    (0.5, 10.5),      # Go above initial obstacles
    (8.1, 10.5),      # Move towards the goal
    (8.1, 8.0),       # Go below obstacle 10
    (9.1, 8.0),       # Move towards the goal
    (9.1, 0.6),       # Go below obstacle 11
    (9.5, 0.6)        # Reach the goal 
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles by carefully maneuvering around them in smaller segments.

### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:24:58 AM] The initial path had issues with segments intersecting obstacles 9, 12, 14, and 15. To address this, the following adjustments were made:

1. **Segment 4 (8.1, 7.8) to (9.0, 7.0):**  This segment intersected with Obstacle 9. To avoid this, we can route the path below Obstacle 9. 

2. **Segment 5 (9.0, 7.0) to (9.5, 0.6):**  This segment intersected with Obstacles 12, 14, and 15.  Instead of going directly to the goal, we can route the path to the right of these obstacles and then move down towards the goal.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),        # Start in the start set
    (0.5, 10.5),       # Move upwards
    (8.1, 10.5),       # Move rightwards 
    (8.1, 5.5),       # Move downwards, clearing Obstacle 9
    (9.8, 5.5),       # Move rightwards, clearing Obstacles 12, 14, 15
    (9.8, 0.6),       # Move downwards
    (9.5, 0.6)        # Move slightly left to the goal
] 
```

This new path avoids all obstacles and reaches the goal by strategically maneuvering around the challenging areas.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

[08/22/2024 11:25:16 AM] The initial path has two segments intersecting with obstacles. Let's analyze how to fix them:

1. **Segment 4 ((8.1, 5.5) to (9.8, 5.5))**: This segment intersects with Obstacle 9, which spans vertically from y = -0.0 to y = 8.5 at x = 8.4. To avoid this, we can add a waypoint above Obstacle 9 before proceeding horizontally to the goal set.

2. **Segment 5 ((9.8, 5.5) to (9.8, 0.6))**: This segment intersects with obstacles 13 and 15.  Since we need to approach the goal from the left, we can add a waypoint to the left of obstacles 13 and 15 before moving up to the goal.

Considering these adjustments, the improved path is: 

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),       # Start point
    (0.5, 10.5),      # Move up clearing all initial obstacles
    (8.1, 10.5),      # Move right towards the goal 
    (8.1, 9.0),      # Move up further to clear Obstacle 9
    (9.2, 9.0),      # Move right towards the goal, staying above Obstacle 9
    (9.2, 5.5),      # Move down, staying clear of Obstacle 10 
    (9.2, 2.0),       # Move down further, clearing obstacles 13 and 15
    (9.5, 2.0),       # Move right, towards the goal
