# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:04:02 AM] The provided environment has a bottleneck around x-coordinate in the range 2 to 4. A viable path needs to navigate this bottleneck while staying clear of obstacles 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.  Additionally, obstacles 9 and 10 form a narrow passage on the right side of the environment.

Here's a potential path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Starting point within the start set
    (2.1, 5.5),  # Navigate above obstacles 2 and 3
    (4.9, 5.5),  # Move further right, staying above obstacle 5
    (7.1, 8.6), # Navigate above obstacle 8 and into the passage between obstacles 9 and 10
    (9.5, 0.6)   # Endpoint within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(0.5, 0.5) to (2.1, 5.5):** This segment takes the path above obstacles 2 and 3, safely navigating the bottleneck.
2. **(2.1, 5.5) to (4.9, 5.5):**  This segment moves the path further right, maintaining a safe distance from obstacles 3, 4, and 5.
3. **(4.9, 5.5) to (7.1, 8.6):** This segment takes the path above obstacle 8, positioning it to go through the passage between obstacles 9 and 10.
4. **(7.1, 8.6) to (9.5, 0.6):** This final segment navigates through the passage and reaches the goal set. 

It's important to note that this is just one potential path, and other viable solutions may exist. It would be helpful to visualize these waypoints on a graph with the obstacles to verify the path's feasibility.

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:04:11 AM] The initial path crosses multiple obstacles. To correct this, let's analyze the environment and find a safe route:

1. **Start to Obstacle 1:** The first segment needs to go above Obstacle 1. We can achieve this by aiming for a point with a y-coordinate greater than 9.0. 

2. **Navigating the Obstacles:** Obstacles 2, 3, and 4 form a vertical barrier. We need to navigate above them.  A path above y = 10.0 seems safe.

3. **Approaching the Goal:** Obstacles 9 and 10 present the last challenge. We need to go above them and then descend towards the goal.

Considering these observations, here's a possible revised path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (1.1, 9.5),    # Go above Obstacle 1
    (2.3, 10.2),   # Stay above Obstacles 2, 3, and 4
    (4.7, 10.2),   # Continue above the obstacles 
    (6.9, 10.2),   # Maintain position above obstacles
    (8.5, 10.2),   # Prepare to navigate around Obstacles 9 and 10
    (8.9, 8.7),    # Navigate above Obstacles 9 and 10
    (9.5, 0.6)     # Reach the goal within the goal set
]
```

This path aims to stay clear of the obstacles by maintaining a safe distance. Remember, this is just one possible solution, and other valid paths might exist.

Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:04:19 AM] The original path collides with obstacle 1 right at the beginning. To avoid this, the path should first move to the right, avoiding obstacle 1. 
The path then correctly goes around obstacles 2 and 3. 
Obstacles 4 and 5 are connected, but the path successfully maneuvers around them.
Similarly, the path successfully navigates around obstacles 6 and 7. 
The segment between waypoints (8.9, 8.7) and (9.5, 0.6) crosses multiple obstacles. To rectify this, the path needs to navigate above obstacles 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, before descending to the goal.

Here is the modified path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  
    (2.1, 0.5),  
    (2.3, 10.2),

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:04:31 AM] The initial path has intersections with obstacles in three segments. Let's analyze and correct them:

**Segment 1:** The line from (0.5, 0.5) to (2.1, 0.5) intersects Obstacle 1.  We need to route the path above Obstacle 1. 

**Segment 2:** The line from (2.1, 0.5) to (2.3, 10.2) intersects Obstacle 3.  Since we need to go above Obstacle 1, we can route the path to the right of Obstacles 2 and 3.

**Segment 8:** The line from (9.5, 8.7) to (9.5, 0.6) intersects Obstacles 11, 13, and 15. These obstacles create a "wall" that prevents direct access to the goal set from this direction. We need to find a way around these obstacles.

Here's the adjusted path:

**new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),       # Start point
    (0.5, 9.2),       # Go above Obstacle 1
    (2.6, 9.2),       # Move to the right, staying above Obstacle 1
    (2.6, 10.2),      # Continue moving right, clear of Obstacles 2 & 3
    (4.7, 10.2),      # Proceed with the original path 
    (6.9, 10.2), 
    (8.5, 10.2), 
    (8.9, 8.7),       # Now to the left of the obstacle "wall"
    (8.9, 7.0),       # Go below Obstacle 11 
    (8.9, 4.5),       # Continue down, below Obstacles 13 & 15
    (9.5, 4.5),       # Move right 
    (9.5, 0.6)        # Reach the goal point
]** 

This path avoids all obstacles and reaches the goal set by navigating around the challenging "wall" of obstacles near the goal.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:04:42 AM] The initial path has some collisions that need to be addressed:

1. **Segment 2:** Collides with Obstacle 3 because it tries to go directly right at a height of 9.2. To fix this, the path needs to navigate above Obstacle 3.
2. **Segment 8, 9, and 11:** These segments collide with Obstacles 10, 12, and 15 respectively because they attempt to move directly down at x-coordinate 8.9. The solution is to navigate to the right of these obstacles.

Considering these points, here's a revised path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),        # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 9.2),        # Move up, staying clear of Obstacle 1
    (2.6, 9.2),        # Move right, staying below Obstacle 3
    (2.6, 10.2),       # Move up, clearing Obstacle 3
    (4.7, 10.2),       # Move right
    (6.9, 10.2),       # Move right
    (8.5, 10.2),       # Move right
    (8.5, 8.2),        # Move down, clearing Obstacle 10
    (9.1, 8.2),        # Move right, staying above Obstacles 11, 12
    (9.1, 5.8),        # Move down, clearing Obstacle 12
    (9.5, 5.8),        # Move right
    (9.5, 2.2),        # Move down, clearing Obstacle 15 
    (9.5, 0.6)         # Move down to the end position within the goal set 
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles by carefully choosing waypoints that allow for clear vertical and horizontal movements.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:04:59 AM] The initial path has intersections with obstacles in four segments. I will adjust each segment while ensuring a safe distance from the obstacles:

1. **Segment 2: (0.5, 9.2) to (2.6, 9.2)** 
   - This segment intersects with Obstacle 3. 
   - To avoid this, I will route the path above Obstacle 3.
   - Modified segment: (0.5, 9.2) -> (2.6, 10.2)

2. **Segment 7: (8.5, 10.2) to (8.5, 8.2)**
   - This segment intersects with Obstacle 10.
   - To avoid this, I will route the path to the left of Obstacle 10.
   - Modified segment: (8.5, 10.2) -> (8.1, 10.2) -> (8.1, 8.2)

3. **Segment 9: (9.1, 8.2) to (9.1, 5.8)**
   - This segment intersects with Obstacle 12.
   - To avoid this, I will route the path to the right of Obstacle 12.
   - Modified segment: (9.1, 8.2) -> (9.5, 8.2) -> (9.5, 5.8)

4. **Segment 11: (9.5, 5.8) to (9.5, 2.2)**
   - This segment intersects with Obstacles 13 and 15. 
   - To avoid these, I will route the path further to the right.
   - Modified segment: (9.5, 5.8) -> (10.2, 5.8) -> (10.2, 2.2) -> (9.5, 2.2) 

Therefore, the updated path considering obstacle avoidance is:

```
new_path = [

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:05:09 AM] The path intersects with obstacles in two locations. Let's adjust the path to avoid these:

* **Segment 8 (8.1, 8.2) to (9.1, 8.2):**  This segment tries to move horizontally directly beside obstacle 9, causing an intersection. We can fix this by going around the top of obstacle 9.  

* **Segment 10 (9.5, 8.2) to (9.5, 5.8):** This segment cuts through obstacle 11.  We'll adjust by moving further to the right, outside of obstacle 11.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 9.2), 
    (2.6, 10.2),

    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:05:18 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid crossing obstacle 11. To achieve this, we can add a waypoint to the right of obstacles 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, before moving down to the goal. 

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 9.2), 
    (2.6, 10.2), 
    (4.7, 10.2), 
    (6.9, 10.2), 
    (8.5, 10.2), 
    (8.1, 10.2), 
    (8.1, 8.6), 
    (9.1, 8.6), 
    (9.5, 8.6), 
    (10.2, 8.6), # new waypoint to the right of the obstacles
    (10.2, 5.8), 
    (10.2, 2.2), 
    (9.5, 2.2), 
    (9.5, 0.6)
