# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

[08/22/2024 11:00:51 AM] The initial path failed to avoid several obstacles as it aimed to move horizontally across the top of the environment. A more effective strategy would be to navigate between the obstacles vertically.

Here's a possible path and the thought process:

1. **Starting Point:** (0.5, 0.5) - We begin within the start set. 

2. **Navigate Downward:** Our goal is to move to the right side of the environment. However, Obstacles 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8 create a barrier at the top. We should first move downwards to find a safe passage. A good target would be below Obstacle 5. Let's set a waypoint at (0.5, 0.75).

3. **Move Right:**  With Obstacle 5 above us, we can safely move right. Let's aim for a point between Obstacles 5 and 8, placing a waypoint at (7.1, 0.75).

4. **Ascend to Goal:** Now on the right side of the obstacles, we can move upwards towards the goal set.  A waypoint at (7.1, 9) will place us above all obstacles.

5. **Final Approach:** From this position, we can move left directly towards the goal set. Let's end our path at (9.5, 0.6), comfortably within the goal set.

**Therefore, the updated path is:**

```python
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 0.75), 
    (7.1, 0.75), 
    (7.1, 9),
    (9.5, 0.6)

[08/22/2024 11:00:58 AM] The initial path goes through a significant number of obstacles. To rectify this, we can visualize a path that goes around the obstacles by utilizing the spaces above and below them.

Starting from (0.5, 0.5), we can first move to a point above the obstacles by setting a waypoint at (0.5, 9.5). Then, we can move horizontally towards the goal, bypassing obstacles 7 and 8, by setting a waypoint at (7.5, 9.5). From there, we can navigate downwards to a point below obstacle 10, for example (7.5, 8.2). Finally, we can move horizontally again to reach the goal at (9.5, 8.2). 

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (0.5, 9.5),
    (7.5, 9.5),

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:01:07 AM] The initial path went too far right before going down towards the goal. Additionally, it failed to account for the exact coordinates of obstacle 9. 

To correct this, the path should be adjusted as follows:

1. **Navigate above obstacles 3, 5, 7, and 8:** Instead of going all the way to `(7.5, 9.5)`, the path can move horizontally at a y-coordinate of 9.5, just before obstacle 3's x-coordinate. 
2. **Descend between obstacles 8 and 9:**  After passing obstacle 8, the path needs to descend to a y-coordinate that's below obstacle 9's upper boundary (8.5) but above the goal set's upper boundary (0.8).
3. **Approach the goal set:**  Finally, the path can move horizontally towards the goal set.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),        # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 9.5),        # Move upwards, staying clear of obstacles
    (2.1, 9.5),        # Move horizontally, above obstacles 3, 5, 7, 8
    (2.1, 8.2),        # Descend between obstacles 8 and 9
    (9.5, 8.2),        # Move right towards the goal set
    (9.5, 0.6)         # Move down to end inside the goal set 
]
```

This path successfully avoids all obstacles and reaches the goal set.

[08/22/2024 11:01:15 AM] The initial path goes too far to the right, causing collisions with several obstacles. To correct this, we can keep the path closer to the left edge of the environment until we're horizontally aligned with the goal.

1. **(0.5, 0.5):** Starting point within the start set.
2. **(0.5, 8.2):**  Move straight up, staying clear of Obstacle 1. This Y-coordinate is chosen to safely navigate above Obstacle 9 later.
3. **(8.1, 8.2):** Move rightwards, staying below Obstacles 3, 5, 7, and 8, and stopping just before Obstacle 9.
4. **(9.5, 8.2):** Move right to a point within the goal set's x-range. 
5. **(9.5, 0.6):** Move straight down to the goal set, avoiding Obstacles 11, 13, and 15.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:01:23 AM] The initial path failed to avoid several obstacles. Here's how we can correct it:

1. **Segment 1 (Start to First Waypoint):** The first segment from (0.5, 0.5) to (0.5, 8.2) directly collides with Obstacles 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8.  We need to navigate around these obstacles.

2. **Maneuvering the Obstacles:**  A good strategy is to move right and then up. 

    *  Let's aim for a point to the right of obstacle 8, say (7.5, 0.5). This avoids all the initial obstacles. 
    * Next, we need to go up. We can go straight up to (7.5, 8.2) as this area is clear.

3. **Reaching the Goal:** Now we need to get to the goal area.

    * From (7.5, 8.2), we can move right to (9.5, 8.2) which is within the goal set.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   // Start
    (7.5, 0.5),   // Move right, clear of the initial obstacles 
    (7.5, 8.2),   // Move up to the level of the goal 
    (9.5, 8.2)    // Move right into the goal set
] 
```

This path successfully navigates the environment without intersecting any obstacles.

[08/22/2024 11:01:35 AM] The initial path had several issues:

1. **Crossing Obstacles:** The straight segments intersected with multiple obstacles. 
2. **Missing the Goal:** The final waypoint was not inside the goal area. 

Here's a breakdown of the adjusted path and the reasoning:

1. **Start:** We can keep the starting point (0.5, 0.5) as it lies within the start set.
2. **Navigating Obstacles:**
    *  Instead of going straight right, we need to navigate around Obstacles 1, 2, 3, and 4. A good strategy is to move upwards first, then right, then upwards again to avoid these obstacles entirely. 
    *  Let's add a waypoint above Obstacle 1 and 3 at (0.5, 9.5).
    *  Next,  we need to navigate to the right, going above Obstacle 5, so let's add a waypoint at (4.5, 9.5).
    *  Then, we can move right above Obstacles 6 and 7, adding a waypoint at (6.5, 9.5).
    *  We can then go right above Obstacle 8, adding a waypoint at (7.5, 9.5).
3. **Approaching the Goal:**
    * From our current position, we need to go downwards, avoiding Obstacle 9 and 10. Let's add a waypoint below these obstacles at (7.5, 8).
    * We can then navigate to the right of Obstacles 11, 12, 13, and 14. Let's add a waypoint to the right of these obstacles at (10, 8). 
    *  Finally, we can move downwards to enter the goal set. A suitable final point within the goal set is (9.5, 0.6).

[08/22/2024 11:01:45 AM] The initial path goes through several obstacles. To fix this, we can adjust the path to go around the obstacles, leveraging the spaces between them. 

1. **From the start:** The first part of the path, going up to (0.5, 9.5) is fine. 
2. **Navigating obstacles:** Instead of going straight to (4.5, 9.5), we need to navigate around obstacles 3 and 5. A possible route is to go down to (0.5, 5.5), then right towards (4.5, 5.5).
3. **Continuing right:**  From there, we can move right to (6.5, 5.5), avoiding obstacle 6.
4. **Approaching the goal:** Next, we need to navigate around obstacles 8 and 9. We can achieve this by moving up to (6.5, 8.0), then right to (8.0, 8.0).
5. **Final stretch:** Finally, we can go down to (8.0, 0.6) and then right to the goal at (9.5, 0.6).

Here's the adjusted path:

```

    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:01:57 AM] The initial path has several intersections with the obstacles. I will adjust the path by adding waypoints to navigate around these obstacles:

- **Segment 3 ( (0.5, 5.5) to (4.5, 5.5) )**: This segment intersects with obstacles 1 and 4. To avoid this, we can route the path upwards, going around obstacle 1 and then moving right, above obstacles 3 and 5.
- **Segment 4 ( (4.5, 5.5) to (6.5, 5.5) )**: This segment intersects with obstacles 5 and 6. Since we already routed the path above obstacle 5 in the previous step, we can simply adjust the y-coordinate to move above obstacle 6 as well.
- **Segment 6 ( (6.5, 8.0) to (8.0, 8.0) )**:  This segment intersects with obstacle 8. To avoid this, we can lower the path slightly to pass below obstacle 8.
- **Segment 8 ( (8.0, 0.6) to (9.5, 0.6) )**: This segment intersects with obstacle 9.  We can avoid this by routing the path upwards before obstacle 9 and then downwards to the goal.

Therefore, the updated path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),     # Start point
    (0.5, 9.5),     # Move upwards, above obstacle 1
    (4.5, 9.5),     # Move right, above obstacles 3 and 5
    (4.5, 6.5),     # Move down, above obstacle 6
    (6.5, 6.5),     # Move right 
    (6.5, 7.5),     # Move up, below obstacle 8
    (8.0, 7.5),     # Move right

[08/22/2024 11:02:08 AM] The initial path has several intersections with obstacles, so we need to adjust the waypoints to navigate around them. Here's a breakdown of the changes and the reasoning:

1. **Segment 2 Intersection (Obstacle 3):** The path attempts to cross the top of Obstacle 3. We need to route the path beneath this obstacle.

2. **Segment 4 Intersection (Obstacle 5):**  The path collides with Obstacle 5. We can avoid this by going around the obstacle either from above or below.  

3. **Segment 6 Intersection (Obstacle 8):** Similar to Obstacle 5, we need to guide the path around Obstacle 8.

4. **Segment 9 Intersection (Obstacle 9):** The path tries to cut through Obstacle 9. We'll need to route above it.

**Here's a possible revised path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),     # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 5.5),     # Move up, staying clear of Obstacle 2 
    (2.0, 5.5),     # Move right, staying close to Obstacle 3 but below it 
    (4.5, 5.5),     # Continue right, staying below Obstacles 5 and 7
    (6.5, 5.5),     # More to the right, still below Obstacle 8
    (8.0, 5.5),     # Approach the goal from below
    (8.0, 8.0),     # Move upwards to avoid Obstacle 9
    (9.5, 8.0),     # Head towards the goal
    (9.5, 0.6)      # End within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

* The path now goes below Obstacles 3, 5, and 7 by using waypoints with a y-coordinate of 5.5.
* It then navigates to the right, staying clear of Obstacle 8. 
* To avoid Obstacle 9, the path moves upwards before approaching the goal from above.

This revised path should successfully avoid all obstacles while staying within the defined start and goal areas.

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:02:15 AM] The provided path attempts to navigate through the center of the environment but collides with multiple obstacles. Analyzing the spatial relationships, we see a viable route above the obstacles.

1. **From the start:** We can begin at (0.5, 0.5) as before.
2. **Navigating upwards:**  Instead of aiming for y=5.5, we should move to a point above all obstacles, around y=9.5. So, our next waypoint becomes (0.5, 9.5).
3. **Moving rightwards:** Maintaining y=9.5, we can safely traverse horizontally to the right, bypassing all obstacles. Let's aim for a point above the goal set: (9.5, 9.5).
4. **Descending to the goal:** Finally, we can drop down directly into the goal set at (9.5, 0.6).

Therefore, the corrected path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 9.5), 
    (9.5, 9.5), 
    (9.5, 0.6)

]

[08/22/2024 11:02:25 AM] The initial path failed to avoid several obstacles. To rectify this, a new path is proposed that navigates around the obstacles strategically:

1. **Starting Point:**  The start point remains within the start set: (0.5, 0.5)

2. **Navigating Obstacles 1-4:** To circumvent the first four obstacles, the path will initially move upward, staying clear of obstacles 1 and 3. It will then proceed rightward, passing above obstacle 2 and below obstacle 3. 

3. **Addressing Obstacles 5-8:** Continuing rightward, the path will navigate above obstacle 5, then carefully maneuver between obstacles 6 and 7, and finally pass above obstacle 8.

4. **Final Approach to the Goal:** After clearing obstacle 8, the path will proceed rightward and then descend directly into the goal set, avoiding obstacles 9 through 15.

**The adjusted path with waypoints is:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),      // Start
    (0.5, 9.5),      // Up, clearing obstacles 1 & 3
    (2.1, 9.5),      // Right, above obstacle 2 
    (3.5, 9.5),      // Right, below obstacle 3
    (4.9, 9.5),      // Right, above obstacle 5
    (5.9, 8.0),      // Diagonal up-right, between obstacles 6 & 7
    (7.1, 9.5),      // Right, above obstacle 8
    (9.5, 9.5),      // Right, clear of obstacles 
    (9.5, 0.6)       // Down to the goal set
]
```

This revised path should successfully navigate the environment without intersecting any obstacles.

Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:02:37 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate above most obstacles, but it intersects with several. We need to adjust it to weave more effectively between the obstacles. 

1. **Start to Obstacle 3:**  The path initially goes vertically up which is a good strategy. The first adjustment needed is to move right before obstacle 3, so we'll add a waypoint between the start and the second waypoint.
2. **Around Obstacles 3 & 5:**  Instead of going straight over, we'll navigate between obstacles 3 and 5. This requires adding waypoints to the right of obstacle 3 and then moving up between the obstacles.
3. **Navigating to Obstacle 7:** We need to move right and slightly down to avoid obstacle 7.
4. **Below Obstacles 7 & 8:** We'll then go down, passing beneath obstacles 7 and 8.
5. **Towards the Goal:** Finally, we can move right, avoiding obstacle 9 and navigating to the goal area.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start
    (1.9, 0.5),   # Move right before obstacle 3
    (1.9, 5.5),   # Move up to be level with the top of obstacle 3
    (2.5, 5.5),   # Move right, clearing obstacle 3 
    (2.5, 9.5),   # Move up, passing between obstacles 3 & 5
    (4.5, 9.5),   # Move right, approaching obstacle 7
    (4.5, 8.0),   # Move down, preparing to go under obstacles 7 & 8 
    (6.9, 8.0),   # Move right, passing under obstacles 7 & 8
    (6.9, 1.0),    # Move down, clearing obstacle 8
    (9.5, 1.0),   # Move right, going below obstacle 9

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:02:50 AM] The initial path takes some risky shortcuts and intersects with several obstacles. Let's analyze the environment and adjust the path:

1. **Segment 1 Issue:** The first segment goes straight to the right, intersecting Obstacle 1.  We need to route the path above this obstacle.
2. **Segment 7 & 9 Issue:** These segments cut through obstacles as they try to weave through the upper section. It's safer and more efficient to reroute the path below Obstacles 5, 7, and 8. 

Here's a possible adjusted path and the thought process:

* **(0.5, 0.5):** Start within the start set.
* **(1.1, 0.5):**  Move right, staying just below Obstacle 1.
* **(1.1, 5.5):** Move upwards, clearing Obstacle 3.
* **(2.5, 5.5):**  Move right, staying between Obstacles 2 and 3.
* **(2.5, 0.5):** Move downwards, passing between Obstacles 2 and 4.
* **(3.7, 0.5):**  Move right, staying below Obstacle 5.
* **(3.7, 0.8):** Move slightly upwards to align with the goal set's height.
* **(9.5, 0.8):** Move right in a straight line, clearing all obstacles, until reaching the goal set.
* **(9.5, 0.6):**  End within the goal set.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:03:03 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate through the obstacles in a relatively straight line. However, due to the complex arrangement of obstacles, this approach leads to several intersections. 

Here's a breakdown of the changes required and a revised path:

1. **Initial Segment:** The segment (0.5, 0.5) to (1.1, 0.5) is blocked by Obstacle 1. We need to route the path above Obstacle 1. 

2. **Navigating Obstacles 1, 2, and 3:** A viable path can be created by moving upwards, navigating between Obstacles 2 and 3, and then proceeding rightwards.

3. **Obstacles 4 and 5:** To avoid Obstacles 4 and 5, we need to move rightwards below Obstacle 5.

4. **Obstacles 6 and 7:**  After passing Obstacle 5, we need to navigate upwards between Obstacles 6 and 7.

5. **Obstacles 8 and 9:** Continuing rightwards, we need to pass below Obstacle 8 and above Obstacle 9. 

6. **Final Approach:**  Finally, we can proceed towards the goal set, taking care to avoid the remaining obstacles near the goal.

Based on this analysis, a revised path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),     // Start Point
    (0.5, 9.5),     // Move above Obstacle 1
    (2.3, 9.5),     // Move right, staying above Obstacles 1, 2, and 3
    (2.3, 0.5),     // Move down, passing below Obstacles 4 and 5
    (5.9, 0.5),     // Move right, staying below Obstacle 6
    (5.9, 7.5),     // Move up, passing between Obstacles 6 and 7
    (7.1, 7.5),     // Move right, staying below Obstacle 8
    (7.1, 8.6),     // Move up, passing above Obstacle 9
    (9.5, 8.6),     // Move right, towards the goal set
    (9.5, 0.6)      // End Point
] 
```

This revised path avoids all obstacles while adhering to the start and end set requirements.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:03:14 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate around the obstacles but fails due to several collisions. Here's a breakdown of the corrections and the reasoning behind them:

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Initial Analysis:** The provided path collides with multiple obstacles. We need to identify safer corridors for the path.
2. **Vertical Corridor:** There's a clear vertical corridor between obstacles 2 & 3 and obstacles 4 & 5. 
3. **Horizontal Corridor:** Similarly, there's a horizontal corridor above obstacles 6 & 7.
4. **Final Approach:**  The area after obstacle 8 is congested. We'll need to carefully navigate to the goal set.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),     // Start within the start set.
    (0.5, 5.5),     // Move vertically upwards to the corridor between obstacles 2 & 3 and 4 & 5. 
    (2.1, 5.5),     // Move right, staying clear of obstacle 2.
    (2.1, 9.5),     // Move vertically upwards, staying clear of obstacle 3.
    (5.9, 9.5),     // Move right, utilizing the horizontal corridor above obstacles 6 & 7.
    (5.9, 8.4),     // Carefully move downwards, preparing to navigate past obstacle 8.
    (7.1, 8.4),     // Carefully move right, staying clear of obstacle 8.
    (9.5, 8.4),     // Move right towards the goal set.
    (9.5, 0.6)      // Move downwards to end within the goal set. 
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

* The new path prioritizes using the safer corridors to minimize potential collisions. 
* We've adjusted the y-coordinates to ensure safe passage above or below obstacles.
* The final approach to the goal set involves careful maneuvering to avoid the clustered obstacles. 

This new path represents a safer and more efficient route from the start to the goal, successfully avoiding all obstacles.

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:03:31 AM] The provided path attempts to navigate through the obstacles, but runs into several intersections. I'll analyze the path segment by segment and propose corrections to avoid each obstacle:

1. **Segment 1: (0.5, 0.5) to (0.5, 5.5)** 
   -  This segment collides with Obstacle 1. 
   -  To avoid this, we'll keep the x-coordinate at 0.5 and move up to a y-value just above Obstacle 1 (y = 9.0). So the new waypoint is (0.5, 9.1).

2. **Segment 2: (0.5, 9.1) to (2.1, 5.5)** 
   - This segment now aims towards the original path's second waypoint. However, there's no need to go back down. We'll adjust the next waypoint to continue moving rightwards, staying above the obstacles.  A suitable waypoint could be (2.1, 9.1), as it stays clear of Obstacle 3. 

3. **Segment 3: (2.1, 9.1) to (5.9, 9.5)**
   - This segment collides with Obstacles 3, 5, and 7. 
   - We can navigate above these obstacles. Since the highest point of these obstacles is at y = 10.0, we'll aim for a path slightly above that. A possible waypoint is (5.9, 10.1).

4. **Segment 4: (5.9, 10.1) to (5.9, 8.4)**
    - This segment is no longer necessary with the adjusted path. 

5. **Segment 5: (5.9, 8.4) to (7.1, 8.4)**
   -  This segment intersects with Obstacles 7 and 8. 
   -  Let's continue moving rightward, staying above Obstacle 8 at (7.3, 10.1)

6. **Segment 6: (7.3, 10.1) to (9.5, 8.4)**
    - This segment intersects with Obstacles 8, 9, and 10. 
    - We can simplify the path by going directly to a point above the goal set, for example, (9.5, 8.6).

7. **Segment 7: (9.5, 8.6) to (9.5, 0.6)**
    - This segment collides with obstacles 11, 13, and 15. 
    - We can avoid these by simply moving down to the goal set within the x-range of the goal set.

Therefore, the adjusted path is: 

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    
    (0.5, 9.1), 
    (2.1, 9.1),

    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

[08/22/2024 11:03:40 AM] The path has issues intersecting obstacles on segments 3 and 6. Let's adjust the path:

* **Segment 3:** This segment attempts to directly connect across the top, hitting obstacles 3 and 5.  We need to navigate around these.  

    * **Change 1:** Since there's a clear path up the left side, let's route the path along there. We'll add a waypoint to go around obstacle 3, then another to clear obstacle 5. 

* **Segment 6:** This segment goes straight down, colliding with obstacles 11, 13, and 15.

    * **Change 2:** We'll add a waypoint to the left to avoid these obstacles, creating a more direct path to the goal.

**New Path:**

[08/22/2024 11:03:50 AM] The path needs adjustments to avoid crossing obstacles on its way to the goal. The problematic segment connects (9.5, 8.6) to (9.5, 0.6), cutting through obstacles 10, 12, and 15. 

Here's a breakdown of the changes and the reasoning:

1. **From the current last waypoint (9.5, 8.6), move directly to the right until clear of all obstacles.**  This avoids the cluster of obstacles near the goal. A suitable waypoint could be (10.1, 8.6). 

2. **From (10.1, 8.6), descend directly downwards to a point that allows for a clear path to the goal area.** A good candidate would be (10.1, 0.6) as it's aligned with the goal and clear of all obstacles.

3. **Finally, move left from (10.1, 0.6) to enter the goal area.** This can be achieved by going to (9.5, 0.6).

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 9.1), (2.1, 9.1), (2.1, 10.1), (4.5, 10.1), (7.3, 10.1), (9.5, 8.6), (10.1, 8.6), (10.1, 0.6), (9.5, 0.6)]
