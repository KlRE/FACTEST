# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:18:00 AM] The path needs to navigate through a maze-like environment to reach the goal. Here's a possible path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start within the start set.
    (2.0, 0.5),  # Move right, staying clear of Obstacle 1 & 2.
    (2.0, 5.5),  # Move upwards, passing between Obstacles 2 & 3. 
    (4.0, 5.5),  # Move right, staying clear of Obstacle 5.
    (4.0, 0.5),  # Move downwards, passing between Obstacles 5 & 6.
    (6.5, 0.5),  # Move right, staying clear of Obstacle 6.
    (6.5, 7.5),  # Move upwards, passing between Obstacles 7 & 8.
    (8.0, 7.5),  # Move right, approaching the goal area.
    (8.0, 8.0),  # Move upwards, preparing to enter the goal set.
    (9.5, 8.0)   # Move right, ending within the goal set. 
]
```

**Explanation:**

This path strategically maneuvers around each obstacle by identifying safe passages and making incremental movements in the x and y directions. It's important to visualize this path in relation to the given obstacle coordinates to verify its validity.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:18:12 AM] The initial path has several issues:

1. **Obstacle Collision:** It collides with obstacles 1, 4, 6, 8, and 9. 
2. **Goal Miss:** The final waypoint doesn't lie within the goal set.

Let's design a new path addressing these problems.

**Strategy:**

1. **Initial Movement:** Begin at (0.5, 0.5). Move upwards to clear obstacle 1.
2. **Horizontal Traversal:** Navigate rightwards, staying clear of obstacle clusters.
3. **Final Approach:**  Maneuver around obstacle 10 and enter the goal set.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),        // Start
    (0.5, 1.5),        // Clear obstacle 1
    (2.1, 1.5),        // Prepare to go above obstacle 2 
    (2.1, 5.5),        // Clear obstacle cluster 2 & 3
    (4.5, 5.5),        // Clear obstacle 5 
    (4.5, 1.5),        // Navigate below obstacles 5 & 7
    (7.1, 1.5),        // Prepare to go above obstacle 8
    (7.1, 8.2),        // Clear obstacle 8 and position for goal approach
    (9.5, 8.2),        // Position above the goal
    (9.5, 0.6)         // Enter goal set 
]
```

**Explanation:**

- The path carefully maneuvers around obstacle clusters by changing its y-coordinate strategically.
- By moving to (2.1, 5.5), it avoids both obstacles 2 and 3. 
- A similar strategy is used to clear obstacles 5 and 7 by moving to (4.5, 1.5).
- Finally, it positions itself above the goal set before descending to the endpoint (9.5, 0.6), which lies within the goal area.

        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:18:26 AM] The initial path has multiple collisions. Let's analyze the environment and adjust the path accordingly:

1. **Initial Segment:** The first segment goes from (0.5, 0.5) to (0.5, 1.5), which collides with Obstacle 1. To avoid this, we can route the path above Obstacle 1. 

2. **Navigating Obstacles 1, 2, 3, and 4:** A safe passage can be established by going to (0.5, 9.5) – above Obstacle 1, then to (2.1, 9.5), and then to (2.1, 5.5), successfully avoiding Obstacles 2 and 3 in the process. From there, the path can proceed to (3.7, 5.5), steering clear of Obstacle 4. 

3. **Avoiding Obstacles 5 and 6:** The path needs to navigate around Obstacles 5 and 6. A viable route is to move to (3.7, 1.5), safely below Obstacle 5, and then to (5.9, 1.5), staying clear of Obstacle 6.

4. **Maneuvering Around Obstacles 7, 8, and 9:** The path then needs to get past Obstacles 7, 8, and 9. A safe route is (5.9, 8.0) and then to (7.6, 8.0), avoiding the obstacles effectively.

5. **Final Stretch and Goal:** Finally, to avoid obstacles 11, 13, and 15 while approaching the goal, the path can proceed to (7.6, 0.6) and then directly to the goal at (9.5, 0.6).

Therefore, the corrected path is:

```python
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 9.5), 
    (2.1, 9.5),

[08/22/2024 11:18:39 AM] The provided path intersects with multiple obstacles. I will adjust the path to avoid these collisions. 

1. **Segment 4 (2.1, 5.5) to (3.7, 5.5):** This segment attempts to pass directly through obstacle 4. To avoid this, I will route the path above obstacle 4 by raising the y-coordinate.
2. **Segments 6, 7, and part of 8:** These segments run into a cluster of obstacles (5, 6, and 7). I will adjust the path to navigate around these obstacles by moving right before obstacle 5, then moving upwards to pass obstacle 7.
3. **Segment 10 (7.6, 0.6) to (9.5, 0.6):** This segment collides with obstacle 9. To avoid this, the path needs to go above this obstacle.

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),      // Start
    (0.5, 9.5),      // Up
    (2.1, 9.5),      // Right
    (2.1, 5.5),     // Down 
    (3.3, 5.5),     // Right, adjusted to be just before Obstacle 4
    (3.3, 9.5),     // Up, to go above Obstacle 4
    (4.5, 9.5),     // Right
    (4.5, 1.5),     // Down, to navigate between Obstacles 5 and 6 
    (5.5, 1.5),     // Right, to be just before Obstacle 6
    (5.5, 8.0),     // Up, to clear Obstacle 7
    (7.6, 8.0),     // Right
    (7.6, 8.6),     // Up, to clear Obstacle 9
    (9.5, 8.6),     // Right

[08/22/2024 11:18:52 AM] The feedback indicates that the original path has several intersections with obstacles. Here's how I'll adjust the path, focusing on problematic segments:

* **Segment 8 (4.5, 1.5) to (5.5, 1.5):** This segment directly crosses Obstacle 5. To avoid this, I'll route the path upwards before Obstacle 5, then move right, effectively going around it. 
* **Segment 10 (5.5, 8.0) to (7.6, 8.0):** This segment intersects both Obstacle 7 and 8. The solution here is to navigate through the gap between Obstacles 6 and 7. 
* **Segment 13 (9.5, 8.6) to (9.5, 0.6):**  This segment intersects Obstacles 11, 13, and 15. To avoid these, the path needs to move left before encountering these obstacles. The path can then move downwards safely.

Considering these adjustments, here's the corrected path:

```

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:19:04 AM] The path needs adjustments to avoid colliding with obstacles 8 and 9. 

* **Issue 1:** The segment (5.5, 6.5) to (7.6, 6.5) intersects obstacle 8.
    * **Solution:**  We can guide the path around obstacle 8 by going below it. We'll adjust the problematic segment and introduce a new waypoint to navigate around the obstacle. 

* **Issue 2:** The segment (8.1, 0.6) to (9.5, 0.6) cuts through obstacle 9.
    * **Solution:** We can simply adjust the y-coordinate of these waypoints to a value above obstacle 9 to avoid collision.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 9.5), 
    (2.1, 9.5), 
    (2.1, 5.5), 
    (3.3, 5.5), 
    (3.3, 9.5), 
    (4.5, 9.5), 
    (4.5, 0.5), 
    (5.5, 0.5),  # adjusted to go below obstacle 8
    (5.5, 0.25), # new waypoint to navigate under obstacle 8
    (7.6, 0.25), # adjusted to go below obstacle 8
    (7.6, 8.6),

    (8.1, 8.7),  # adjusted to go above obstacle 9
    (9.5, 8.7)   # adjusted to go above obstacle 9

```
 
This revised path addresses the collision issues while maintaining the start and end points within their respective sets.

2. **Reaching the Goal Set:** The current endpoint (9.5, 8.7) is outside the goal set.  We need to redirect the path downwards after clearing the obstacles and align it with the goal set.

### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:19:23 AM] The path collides with obstacles 8 and 9. To fix this, we can reroute the path as follows:

1.  **Avoid Obstacle 8:** Instead of going directly from (5.5, 6.5) to (7.6, 6.5), we can navigate below obstacle 8. 
2.  **Avoid Obstacle 9:** Similarly, instead of going directly from (7.6, 0.25) to (9.5, 0.25), we can go around obstacle 9 by adding a waypoint to the right.

Here's the corrected path:

```
new_path = [

]

[08/22/2024 11:19:33 AM] The path intersects with obstacle 9 because it attempts to cross through a vertically clustered series of obstacles. To avoid this, the path needs to be adjusted to move around these obstacles.

Here's the adjusted path and the thought process:

1.  **Maintain Initial Trajectory:** Keep the initial waypoints the same until reaching the obstacle cluster.
2. **Navigate Around Obstacles 8 and 9:** Instead of attempting to go through, guide the path around obstacles 8 and 9. This can be achieved by moving further right before heading towards the goal.
3. **Approach Goal:** After clearing the obstacles, adjust the path to approach the goal from a safe direction.

Here's the updated path:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 9.5), (2.1, 9.5), (2.1, 5.5), (3.3, 5.5), (3.3, 9.5), (4.5, 9.5), (4.5, 0.5), (5.5, 0.5), (5.5, 6.5), (6.9, 6.5), (6.9, 0.25), (8.7, 0.25), (9.5, 0.25), (9.5, 0.6)]
```

By shifting the waypoint `(8.6, 0.25)` to `(8.7, 0.25)`, the path successfully avoids obstacle 9.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

## Example
### Provided Data

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:19:59 AM] The path collides with obstacles in two places. 

1. **Segment 13:** The segment from (6.9, 9.0) to (8.1, 9.0) cuts through Obstacle 8. To fix this, we can route the path beneath Obstacle 8. 

2. **Segment 15:** The segment from (8.1, 0.25) to (8.7, 0.25) intersects Obstacle 9.  We can adjust this by going around the left side of Obstacle 9.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 9.5), 
    (2.1, 9.5), 
    (2.1, 5.5),

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:20:17 AM] The path intersects with Obstacle 9 because it attempts to move directly to the right at a y-value of 0.25. To avoid this, we can reroute the path to go above Obstacle 9 before proceeding towards the goal. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 9.5), (2.1, 9.5), (2.1, 5.5), (3.3, 5.5), (3.3, 9.5), (4.5, 9.5), (4.5, 0.5), (5.5, 0.5), (5.5, 6.5), (6.9, 6.5), (6.9, 0.25), (6.9, 0.75), (8.1, 0.75), (8.1, 9.0), (8.7, 9.0), (8.7, 0.25), (9.5, 0.25), (9.5, 0.6)] 
```

Here's the breakdown of the changes:

1. **Original problematic segment:** (8.1, 0.25), (8.7, 0.25)
2. **Added waypoints to go above Obstacle 9:**  (8.1, 9.0), (8.7, 9.0)

By adding these waypoints, the path now goes vertically up to a point above Obstacle 9, then moves right before descending back down to the original path. This ensures the path avoids intersecting with Obstacle 9.

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:20:28 AM] The path goes too far to the right before going down to the goal. By adjusting the path to move downwards earlier, we can avoid intersecting with the obstacles.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 9.5), (2.1, 9.5), (2.1, 5.5), (3.3, 5.5), (3.3, 9.5), (4.5, 9.5), (4.5, 0.5), (5.5, 0.5), (5.5, 6.5), (6.9, 6.5), (6.9, 0.75), (8.1, 0.75), (8.1, 8.2), (8.7, 8.2), (8.7, 0.6), (9.5, 0.6)]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

- **Waypoint (8.1, 9.0) changed to (8.1, 8.2):**  This moves the waypoint down to avoid obstacles 10 and 12.
- **Added Waypoint (8.7, 8.2):** This creates a horizontal segment to reach the right side of obstacle 10.
- **Waypoint (8.7, 0.25) changed to (8.7, 0.6):** This moves the waypoint down to avoid obstacle 14.
- **Removed Waypoint (9.5, 0.25):**  This waypoint is no longer needed as the path can directly reach the goal set from (8.7, 0.6).

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:20:40 AM] The path intersects with obstacles in two segments. 

- Segment 14 between (8.1, 8.2) and (8.7, 8.2) cuts right through obstacle 9. To avoid this, we can lower the y-coordinate of these waypoints to navigate below obstacle 9.
- Segment 15 between (8.7, 8.2) and (8.7, 0.6) intersects with obstacles 12 and 14. Given the narrow passage, it's better to reroute the path to approach the goal from the bottom. We can achieve this by going below obstacle 12 before heading towards the goal.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 9.5),

[08/22/2024 11:20:50 AM] The path collides with Obstacle 9 because it attempts to move directly from (8.1, 0.75) to a point with the same y-coordinate within the goal set. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around Obstacle 9. This can be achieved by adding a waypoint above Obstacle 9 before proceeding to the goal set.

Similarly, the path segment between (8.7, 5.8) and (8.7, 0.6) intersects Obstacle 14. To avoid this, we can route the path to the left of Obstacle 14, ensuring a safe passage to the goal set.

### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:21:03 AM] The path needs adjustments to avoid the obstacles clustered near the goal position. Specifically, the final segment going down from (9.5, 9.0) to (9.5, 0.6) intersects with obstacles 11, 13, and 15. 

To fix this, we can route the path to the left of these obstacles. Here's how:

1.  Instead of going directly to (9.5, 9.0) maintain the path at (8.1, 9.0).
2.  From (8.1, 9.0), move left to a point before obstacle 11, for instance (8.1, 6.9).
3.  Continue downwards to a point before obstacles 12 and 14, for example, (8.1, 4.5).
4.  Move further downwards to a point before obstacle 13, for example, (8.1, 2.1).
5.  Finally, move right and then down to reach the goal set at (9.5, 0.6).

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 9.5), 
    (2.1, 9.5), 
    (2.1, 5.5),

[08/22/2024 11:21:14 AM] The path intersects with Obstacle 9 because it attempts to move directly from (8.1, 2.1) to (9.5, 2.1). To avoid this, we can add a waypoint that goes around Obstacle 9. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 9.5), 
    (2.1, 9.5), 
    (2.1, 5.5),

    (9.5, 0.2), # move right towards the goal set
    (9.5, 0.6)

This path first goes down to y=0.2 to go below Obstacle 9, then moves right towards the goal set.

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:21:26 AM] The path collides with Obstacle 9 because it attempts to move directly from (8.1, 0.2) to (9.5, 0.2).  To avoid this, we can route the path above Obstacle 9.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 9.5), (2.1, 9.5), (2.1, 5.5), 
    (3.3, 5.5), (3.3, 9.5), (4.5, 9.5), (4.5, 0.5), 
    (5.5, 0.5), (5.5, 6.5), (6.9, 6.5), (6.9, 0.75), 
    (8.1, 0.75), (8.1, 9.0), (8.1, 6.9), (8.1, 4.5), 
    (8.1, 2.1), (8.1, 0.2), (8.1, 8.6),  # Move up above Obstacle 9
    (9.5, 8.6),  # Move right above Obstacle 9
    (9.5, 0.6)   # Move down to the goal 
]
```

This path first follows the original path until it reaches the point (8.1, 0.2). Instead of moving directly to the right, it now moves upwards to (8.1, 8.6), safely clearing Obstacle 9. Then, it moves right to (9.5, 8.6) and finally downwards to (9.5, 0.6) to reach the goal set. This ensures that the path avoids all obstacles.

    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:21:55 AM] The path collides with obstacles because it goes to (9.5, 8.6) before going down to the goal. 
To avoid this, the path should move to the right side before reaching obstacle 10, then navigate downwards to the goal set.

Here's the updated path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 9.5), 
    (2.1, 9.5), 
    (2.1, 5.5), 
    (3.3, 5.5), 
    (3.3, 9.5), 
    (4.5, 9.5), 
    (4.5, 0.5), 
    (5.5, 0.5), 
    (5.5, 6.5), 
    (6.9, 6.5), 
    (6.9, 0.75), 
    (8.1, 0.75), 
    (9.5, 0.75), # Move to the right before the obstacles above the goal set
    (9.5, 0.6) # Then go down to the goal 
]
