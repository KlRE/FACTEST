# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

]

[08/22/2024 11:05:43 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate above most obstacles but fails due to several intersections. We need to refine it by considering safe passageways. 

1. **Segment 2 (Intersects Obstacles 3, 5, 7, 8):**  This segment attempts to move at the top of the environment. Instead, we can navigate between Obstacles 3 and 5. 
    *  Modify waypoint (0.5, 9.5) to (0.5, 5.5) to go below Obstacle 3.
    *  Add a waypoint (2.3, 5.5) to navigate between Obstacles 3 and 5.
    *  Add a waypoint (2.3, 9.5) to move above Obstacle 5.
    *  Add a waypoint (7.1, 9.5) to stay below Obstacle 8.

2. **Segment 6 (Intersects Obstacle 9):** This segment attempts to move horizontally to the right. To avoid Obstacle 9, we can move down before reaching it.
    *  Modify waypoint (8.0, 7.2) to (7.9, 7.2) to allow space for maneuvering.
    *  Add a waypoint (7.9, 6.0) to move below Obstacle 9.
    *  Add a waypoint (8.1, 6.0) to move past Obstacle 9. 
    *  Modify waypoint (8.8, 7.2) to (8.1, 7.2) to connect with the previous adjustments.

3. **Segment 7 (Intersects Obstacle 12):**  This segment now intersects Obstacle 12 due to the previous adjustment. We can simply move right before going down.
    * Modify waypoint (8.8, 5.0) to (9.2, 5.0) to move right before descending.

4. **Segment 9 (Intersects Obstacles 13, 15):** This segment tries to move directly down but encounters obstacles. We can simply follow the right edge of Obstacle 12 to avoid them.
    * Modify waypoint (9.5, 0.6) to (9.2, 0.6) to align with the new path.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:05:53 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate through the obstacles but incurs several collisions. A revised approach is needed to ensure a collision-free path.

Starting from (0.5, 0.5), we can observe a clear path upwards. The first waypoint can be set around (0.5, 9.5) to avoid all obstacles in the starting region. 

Next, the path needs to navigate towards the right edge of the environment to reach the goal.  A waypoint around (7.5, 9.5) allows for a safe passage above obstacles 3, 5, 7, and 8. 

From (7.5, 9.5), the path can move downwards to bypass obstacle 8.  A waypoint at (7.5, 0.5) achieves this, steering clear of all obstacles in the vicinity.

Finally, a clear path exists to reach the goal region. The path can move right and end at (9.5, 0.6), which lies within the goal set.

Therefore, the corrected path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 9.5), 
    (7.5, 9.5), 
    (7.5, 0.5),

[08/22/2024 11:06:05 AM] The initial path went directly from left to right, colliding with obstacles at the top and bottom of the environment. To fix this, we can navigate between the obstacles by using a path that resembles a "staircase" pattern.

1. **Starting Point:**  (0.5, 0.5) - We begin within the start set.
2. **Moving Upwards:** (0.5, 1.5) - We first move upwards, clearing the obstacle directly to the right (Obstacle 1). 
3. **Moving Right:** (2.0, 1.5) -  We then navigate rightwards, staying below Obstacle 3 but above Obstacle 2.
4. **Moving Upwards:** (2.0, 6.5) -  Next, we move upwards, positioning ourselves between Obstacles 3 and 7.
5. **Moving Right:** (4.9, 6.5)  - We proceed rightward, staying below Obstacles 5 and 7.
6. **Moving Upwards:** (4.9, 7.5) -  We move upwards again, placing ourselves above Obstacle 8.
7. **Moving Right:** (7.5, 7.5) -  Continuing rightward, we maneuver to a point above the goal set.
8. **Moving Downwards:** (7.5, 0.6) - We descend downwards, carefully maneuvering between obstacles 9 and 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.
9. **Reaching the Goal:** (9.5, 0.6) - Finally, we move rightward to reach a point within the goal set.

This staircase-like approach ensures we avoid all obstacles while successfully reaching the destination.

Here is the revised path:

[08/22/2024 11:06:22 AM] The initial path has several intersections with obstacles, so we need to adjust it:

1. **Segment 2:** (0.5, 1.5) to (2.0, 1.5) intersects with Obstacle 1. We need to route the path above Obstacle 1. Let's change the second waypoint to (0.5, 9.5) to go above all obstacles. 
2. **Segment 3:** With the adjusted second waypoint, the path now goes directly from (0.5, 9.5) to (2.0, 6.5), potentially intersecting obstacles.  We need to add a waypoint to navigate around Obstacle 3. Let's add a waypoint to the right of Obstacle 3 at (2.5, 9.5), then move down to (2.5, 6.5).
3. **Segment 4:** (2.5, 6.5) to (4.9, 6.5) intersects with Obstacles 3, 4, and 5. Since we are already past Obstacle 3, let's add a waypoint to go above obstacles 4 and 5 at (2.5, 10.5), then move right to (4.9, 10.5). 
4. **Segment 5:** With the adjusted waypoint, the path now goes directly from (4.9, 10.5) to (4.9, 7.5), potentially intersecting obstacles.  Let's remove the waypoint (4.9, 7.5) since we're already going around the obstacles.
5. **Segment 6:** (4.9, 10.5) to (7.5, 7.5) intersects with Obstacles 7 and 8. We need to stay above these obstacles. Let's keep the path at (4.9, 10.5), then move right to (7.5, 10.5).
6. **Segment 7:**  With the adjusted waypoint, the path now goes directly from (7.5, 10.5) to (7.5, 0.6), potentially intersecting obstacles. We need to add waypoints to navigate around obstacles 9 and 10. Let's add a waypoint to the right of obstacle 10 at (9.5, 10.5), then move down to (9.5, 0.6).
7. **Segment 8:** (9.5, 0.6) to (9.5, 0.6) is a redundant segment, let's remove the last waypoint.

Therefore, the updated path is:

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:06:37 AM] The initial path has collisions with Obstacles 3, 11, 13, and 15. Let's analyze and adjust the path:

- **Segment 2 Collision (0.5, 9.5) to (2.5, 9.5):**  This segment attempts to move horizontally at y=9.5. However, Obstacle 3 ([2.4, 10.0], [2.2, 10.0], [2.2, 6.0], [2.4, 6.0]) protrudes above y=9. To avoid this, we should adjust the path to go below Obstacle 3. 
- **Segment 8 Collision (9.5, 10.5) to (9.5, 0.6):** This segment is trying to move vertically down while staying very close to the obstacles on the right.  The path needs to be shifted left to avoid Obstacles 11, 13, and 15. The safest approach is likely to move left before descending.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 5.5),    # Move down to a y-coordinate that's clear of all obstacles
    (2.1, 5.5),    # Move right, staying clear of Obstacle 2
    (2.1, 10.5),   # Move up, staying clear of Obstacle 3
    (4.9, 10.5),   # Move right, now above all obstacles
    (7.5, 10.5),   # Continue right
    (9.1, 10.5),   # Approach the goal from the left 
    (9.1, 0.6)     # Move down to the goal, clear of obstacles
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Initial Vertical Movement:** Instead of going up immediately, the new path first moves down to y=5.5, which is a safe distance below all the obstacles in the initial part of the environment.
2. **Navigating to the Right:** The path then carefully maneuvers right, staying clear of Obstacle 2 by moving to x=2.1 before going up.
3. **Above the Obstacles:** Once past Obstacle 3, the path moves above all obstacles, reaching a safe height of y=10.5.
4. **Approaching the Goal:** The path continues right and then makes a crucial move left before descending. This ensures a safe passage to the goal without colliding with the cluster of obstacles near the goal position.

This adjusted path addresses the collisions and provides a clear and safe route to the goal.

[08/22/2024 11:06:49 AM] The initial path had two problematic segments:

1. **Segment 2 ((0.5, 5.5) to (2.1, 5.5))**: This segment intersects with Obstacle 1, which spans the x-range of 1.0 to 1.2 at a y-level of 5.5. 
2. **Segment 7 ((9.1, 10.5) to (9.1, 0.6))**: This segment intersects with multiple obstacles (10, 12, 14) because it goes straight down while there are obstacles jutting out to the right.

**Here's how to adjust the path:**

1. **Navigating around Obstacle 1:**
   - Instead of going straight right at a y-level of 5.5, we can go higher to avoid Obstacle 1 completely. 
   - A new waypoint at (0.5, 10.5) will allow us to clear Obstacle 1.
2. **Reaching the Goal Set:**
   - To avoid the collisions from Segment 7, we can stay at a high y-level until we are past all the obstacles on the right. 
   - From (7.5, 10.5), move further to the right to (9.5, 10.5). This puts us directly above the goal set.
   - Finally, move straight down to (9.5, 0.6) to end within the goal set.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 10.5),
    (2.1, 10.5),

[08/22/2024 11:06:57 AM] The path needs to navigate around the cluster of obstacles near the goal position.  The previous final segment crossed multiple obstacles by going straight down. To avoid this, we can route the path to the left of these obstacles.

Here's the updated path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (0.5, 10.5),
    (2.1, 10.5),
    (4.9, 10.5),
    (7.5, 10.5), 
    (9.5, 10.5),

    (9.1, 6.0),  # Move down, staying left of obstacles
    (9.5, 0.6)   # Finally move to the goal 
]
```

By adding waypoints that move slightly left and then down, we ensure the path avoids all the obstacles near the goal.

[08/22/2024 11:07:06 AM] The path has issues going from the top to the goal, intersecting with multiple obstacles. To fix this, the path needs to navigate around obstacles 10 and 12 more carefully.

Here's a revised approach:

1. **Maintain the initial part:** Keep the path from the start to (7.5, 10.5) as it successfully avoids the first set of obstacles.

2. **Navigate around obstacle 10:** Instead of going straight down, guide the path around the left side of obstacle 10.

3. **Go between obstacles 10 and 12:**  Aim for a point between obstacles 10 and 12, ensuring enough clearance.

4. **Approach the goal:** From the point between obstacles 10 and 12,  move towards the goal set, avoiding any remaining obstacles.

[08/22/2024 11:07:17 AM] The path needs adjustments to avoid obstacles 9 and 14.  The problematic segments are between waypoints (8.0, 7.0) and (9.5, 0.6). 

1. **Addressing Intersection with Obstacle 9:** The path dips below obstacle 9 before attempting to reach the goal. To avoid this:
    - Instead of going directly from (8.0, 7.0) to (8.25, 6.0), maintain the y-coordinate of 7.0 and navigate to the right of obstacle 9.
    - A new waypoint at (8.5, 7.0) achieves this.

2. **Addressing Intersection with Obstacle 14:** The final segment from (8.25, 6.0) to (9.5, 0.6) cuts through obstacle 14. To rectify this:
    - Since we've already bypassed obstacle 9, continue moving rightwards at a y-coordinate greater than obstacle 14's highest point (3.7).
    -  A new waypoint at (9.0, 4.0) positions the path to then move directly into the goal.

3. **Removing Redundant Waypoints:** The waypoint (8.25, 6.0) is no longer necessary with the new path.

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 10.5), 
    (2.1, 10.5),

    (9.0, 4.0),  # Position to clear Obstacle 14
    (9.5, 0.6)

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:07:26 AM] The path needs adjustments to avoid colliding with obstacles 9, 12, and 14.

* **Segment 7:** To avoid obstacle 9, the path needs to go below it. 
* **Segment 8:** This segment currently cuts through obstacle 12. It's more efficient to go around obstacle 12 on the left side.
* **Segment 9:** To avoid obstacle 14, the path should go above it. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 10.5), 
    (2.1, 10.5),

[08/22/2024 11:07:36 AM] The path needs adjustments to avoid obstacles 9 and 15.

- **Segment 12:**  The path goes directly from (9.5, 4.0) to (9.5, 0.6), intersecting obstacle 15. To fix this, we can guide the path around the bottom of obstacle 15.

[08/22/2024 11:07:47 AM] The path needs adjustments to avoid colliding with obstacles 9 and 15.

- **Issue 1: Collision with Obstacle 9** 
    - The segment (8.1, 3.0) to (9.0, 3.0) cuts through Obstacle 9. 
    - **Solution:**  Instead of moving directly to (9.0, 3.0), we can route the path above Obstacle 9. 

- **Issue 2: Collision with Obstacle 15**
    - The segment (9.5, 3.0) to (9.5, 2.0) collides with Obstacle 15.
    - **Solution:**  We will adjust the path to move around the left side of Obstacle 15.

Here's the adjusted path:

```

]

[08/22/2024 11:08:25 AM] The path goes too far to the right and then tries to correct by going left and down. This causes a collision with obstacles 11, 13, and 15. 

The path should instead move leftwards earlier to avoid these obstacles. Since the obstacles are clustered around the right edge of the environment, the path should hug the left edge to avoid them. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 10.5),  # Move up clearing the first two obstacles
    (2.1, 10.5),  # Move right, staying above obstacles 
    (4.9, 10.5),  # Continue right 
    (7.5, 10.5),  # Approach the obstacle cluster from above
    (8.0, 10.5),  # Carefully navigate above obstacle 10 
    (8.0, 8.0),   # Move down, staying clear of obstacles 10 and 11
    (8.0, 6.0),   # Continue down between obstacles 11 and 12
    (8.0, 4.0),   #  Continue down between obstacles 13 and 14
    (8.0, 2.0),    # Continue down, clear of obstacle 15
    (9.5, 2.0),   # Move right towards the goal
    (9.5, 0.6)    # Move down to end within the goal set 
]
```

This path avoids obstacles by staying to the left and carefully navigating around the cluster of obstacles near the goal.

[08/22/2024 11:08:35 AM] The path intersects with Obstacle 9 because it attempts to move horizontally at a y-coordinate of 2.0, which is within the range of Obstacle 9's y-coordinates. To avoid this, we can adjust the path to move down before reaching Obstacle 9.

Here's how we can adjust the path:

1. **Original path until before Obstacle 9:** Keep the waypoints until (8.0, 2.0) the same.
2. **Navigate around Obstacle 9:** Instead of moving directly to the right, move down to a y-coordinate that is clear of Obstacle 9. Examining the environment, a y-coordinate of 1.0 would work.  So, add a waypoint at (8.0, 1.0).
3. **Proceed to the goal:** From (8.0, 1.0), we can move horizontally to the right, safely avoiding Obstacle 9, and then go up to reach the goal set.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:08:43 AM] The path intersects with Obstacle 9 because the obstacle extends all the way down to y = 0.0. To avoid this, we can adjust the path to move above this obstacle before moving towards the goal.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 10.5), 
    (2.1, 10.5), 
    (4.9, 10.5), 
    (7.5, 10.5), 
    (8.0, 10.5), 
    (8.0, 8.0), 
    (8.0, 6.0), 
    (8.0, 4.0), 
    (8.0, 2.0),
    (8.0, 9.0),  # Move up above Obstacle 9 
    (9.5, 9.0),  # Move right above Obstacle 9
    (9.5, 0.6)   # Move down to the goal set
]
```

This path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles while reaching the goal.

[08/22/2024 11:08:53 AM] The path intersects with obstacles because it goes to (9.5, 9.0) and then straight down to (9.5, 0.6). To fix this, the path should move left before going down. Here's how we can adjust the path:

1. **Original Path until Obstacle:** Keep the path same until (8.0, 2.0), as it does not intersect any obstacles.
2. **Navigate around Obstacles:**  Instead of going up to (8.0, 9.0) and then right to (9.5, 9.0), we will directly move right from (8.0, 2.0) towards the goal set while staying clear of obstacle 15. 
3. **Reach Goal Set:**  Finally, move straight up to enter the goal set.

Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:09:02 AM] The path intersects with Obstacle 9 because it attempts to move directly from (8.0, 2.0) to (9.2, 2.0). To avoid this, we can add a waypoint above Obstacle 9, allowing the path to navigate around it.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 10.5), 
    (2.1, 10.5), 
    (4.9, 10.5), 
    (7.5, 10.5), 
    (8.0, 10.5), 
    (8.0, 8.0), 
    (8.0, 6.0), 
    (8.0, 4.0),
    (8.0, 2.0),
    (8.0, 1.0), # New waypoint to go below obstacle 9
    (9.2, 1.0), # New waypoint to go below obstacle 9
    (9.5, 1.0),  
    (9.5, 0.6)
]
```

This new path first goes below all the top obstacles, then carefully navigates below obstacle 9 to reach the goal.
