# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:09:26 AM] The initial path has several intersections with obstacles and misses the goal set. Let's adjust it:

1. **Segment 2 Intersection (Obstacles 1):** The line (0.5, 8.75) to (2.0, 8.75) cuts through Obstacle 1.  We'll reroute by going below Obstacle 1.
2. **Segment 4 Intersection (Obstacle 4):** The line (2.0, 5.5) to (4.0, 5.5) intersects Obstacle 4. We'll need to navigate around this obstacle, likely by going below it.
3. **Segments 6 Intersection (Obstacles 5, 7):** The segment from (4.0, 9.5) to (6.5, 9.5) crosses both Obstacles 5 and 7. We'll adjust the path to go below these obstacles. 
4. **Segment 10 Intersection (Obstacles 9, 10):**  The final part of the path goes through Obstacles 9 and 10. We'll need to adjust the path to curve around these obstacles and reach the goal set.
5. **Missing the Goal Set:** The path ends at (9.5, 8.4) but needs to be inside the goal set [[9.7, 0.8], [9.3, 0.8], [9.3, 0.4], [9.7, 0.4]].

**Revised Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),       # Start
    (0.5, 0.25),      # Go below Obstacle 1
    (2.0, 0.25), 
    (2.0, 0.5),      # Prepare to go below Obstacle 4
    (4.0, 0.5),      # Clear Obstacle 4
    (4.0, 0.75),     # Prepare to go below Obstacles 5 and 7
    (6.5, 0.75),     # Clear Obstacles 5 and 7
    (6.5, 0.5),     
    (8.0, 0.5),      # Approach Obstacles 9 and 10
    (8.1, 0.6),       # Start curving around obstacles
    (8.2, 2.0),     #  Continue curving
    (9.5, 2.0),      # Position to enter the goal set
    (9.5, 0.6)       # End within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

* The new path avoids obstacles by navigating below them when necessary.
* The path curves around Obstacles 9 and 10 to avoid collision.
* The final waypoint is adjusted to ensure the path ends within the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:09:40 AM] The initial path has several intersections with obstacles. To correct this, the path needs adjustments considering the obstacles' positions and sizes.

- **Segment 2:**  The line from (0.5, 0.25) to (2.0, 0.25) directly cuts through Obstacle 1. We need to route the path above this obstacle.
- **Segment 4:** The path from (2.0, 0.5) to (4.0, 0.5) intersects both Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 4. We should direct the path above these obstacles. 
- **Segment 6:**  The line from (4.0, 0.75) to (6.5, 0.75) collides with Obstacle 6.  The path needs to navigate above this obstacle.
- **Segments 10 & 11:** The path from (8.1, 0.6) to (9.5, 2.0) attempts to cut through Obstacle 9.  Instead, we should route above Obstacle 9.

Considering these points, a modified path is proposed as follows:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 9.5),    # Move up to clear Obstacle 1
    (2.0, 9.5),    # Move right, staying above Obstacle 1
    (2.0, 10.5),   # Move up to clear obstacles 2, 3, and 4 
    (4.0, 10.5),   # Move right above obstacles 2, 3, and 4
    (4.0, 10.25),  # Move down slightly to prepare to clear obstacle 5
    (7.5, 10.25),  # Move right above obstacles 5, 6, 7, and 8
    (7.5, 8.0),   # Move down to a point above obstacle 9
    (9.5, 8.0),   # Move right above obstacle 9
    (9.5, 0.6)    # Move down to the goal set
]
```

This revised path avoids all obstacles and successfully connects the start and goal regions.

[08/22/2024 11:09:48 AM] The initial path went too far east before turning south towards the goal.  This caused collisions with obstacles near the eastern edge of the environment.

[08/22/2024 11:09:58 AM] The issue lies in the final segment of the path attempting to directly cross obstacle 9. To rectify this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle. 

Given the obstacle placement, the most efficient adjustment involves directing the path below obstacle 9. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 9.5), (2.0, 9.5), (2.0, 10.5), (4.0, 10.5), (4.0, 10.25), (7.5, 10.25), (7.5, 7.0), (8.1, 7.0), (8.1, 0.2), (9.5, 0.2), (9.5, 0.6)] 
```

Here's the breakdown of the changes:

1. **Original path endpoint:** (8.1, 0.6)
2. **New waypoint to circumvent obstacle:** (8.1, 0.2) - This dips below obstacle 9.
3. **Final waypoint adjusted for goal set:** (9.5, 0.2) -  Maintains the y-coordinate to avoid re-crossing obstacle 9, then a final (9.5, 0.6) to move into the goal. 

This adjusted path maintains obstacle avoidance while successfully connecting the start and goal sets.

[08/22/2024 11:10:08 AM] The path intersects with Obstacle 9 because it attempts to move directly from (8.1, 0.2) to (9.5, 0.2) at a low y-coordinate. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around Obstacle 9. 

Here's a possible adjustment:

Instead of going directly to (9.5, 0.2), we can route the path upwards after clearing the obstacles on the left side:

1. **From (8.1, 7.0) move to (8.1, 8.75).** This takes the path above Obstacle 9 and 10.
2. **From (8.1, 8.75) move to (9.5, 8.75).**  This moves the path horizontally above obstacles 9 and 10 to a point from which it can descend to the goal.
3. **From (9.5, 8.75) move to (9.5, 0.6).** This final segment takes the path downwards to the goal position, avoiding any obstacle intersections. 

Therefore, the adjusted path is: 

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 9.5), (2.0, 9.5), (2.0, 10.5), (4.0, 10.5), (4.0, 10.25), (7.5, 10.25), (7.5, 7.0), (8.1, 7.0), (8.1, 8.75), (9.5, 8.75), (9.5, 0.6)]

[08/22/2024 11:10:17 AM] The issue is with the last segment of the path going straight down and intersecting with obstacles 11, 13, and 15. To fix this, the path needs to move to the left before descending, navigating around these obstacles.

Here's the updated path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (0.5, 9.5),
    (2.0, 9.5),
    (2.0, 10.5),
    (4.0, 10.5), 
    (4.0, 10.25), 
    (7.5, 10.25),

    (8.1, 7.0), 
    (8.1, 8.75), 
    (9.5, 8.75), 
    (9.1, 8.75),  # Move slightly left to avoid Obstacle 11
    (9.1, 0.6)   # Now descend safely to the goal set 
]
```

Instead of going straight down from (9.5, 8.75), the path now takes a slight detour to (9.1, 8.75) before heading down to (9.1, 0.6). This avoids all the obstacles while staying within the defined environment.

Instead of going directly down to the goal, the modified path will continue rightward, exploiting the space between obstacles 11 and 12. Then, it will proceed downward, carefully maneuvering between obstacles 13 and 14 to finally reach the goal area. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 9.5), 
    (2.0, 9.5), 
    (2.0, 10.5),

    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:10:43 AM] The path needs adjustments to avoid obstacles near the goal. Instead of going straight down, the path should maneuver around obstacles 11, 13, and 15. 

Here's a possible approach:

1. **From waypoint (9.5, 8.75):**  Instead of going straight down to (9.5, 6.0), move right slightly to create space between the path and obstacle 11. A new waypoint could be (9.75, 8.75).
2. **Navigating around obstacles:** From (9.75, 8.75), move down carefully, staying clear of obstacles 11, 13, and 15.  This will likely involve several waypoints to create a zig-zag pattern. Here's a possible sequence:
    * (9.75, 8.0) -  Clear of Obstacle 11
    * (9.5, 8.0) - Aligning for downward movement 
    * (9.5, 5.5)  - Clear of Obstacle 12
    * (9.75, 5.5) -  Preparing to clear Obstacle 13
    * (9.75, 3.0)  - Clear of Obstacle 13
    * (9.5, 3.0) - Aligning for downward movement
    * (9.5, 2.0) - Clear of Obstacle 15 
3. **Final Approach:** From (9.5, 2.0), you can safely move to the final waypoint within the goal set, (9.5, 0.6).

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 9.5), (2.0, 9.5), (2.0, 10.5), (4.0, 10.5), (4.0, 10.25), (7.5, 10.25), (7.5, 7.0), (8.1, 7.0), (8.1, 8.75), (9.5, 8.75), (9.75, 8.75), (9.75, 8.0), (9.5, 8.0), (9.5, 5.5), (9.75, 5.5), (9.75, 3.0), (9.5, 3.0), (9.5, 2.0), (9.5, 0.6)]

[08/22/2024 11:10:56 AM] The original path was trying to navigate too closely to the obstacles on the right side of the environment.  To correct this, we can adjust the path to move further left, giving a wider berth to obstacles 11, 13, and 15. Here's a possible revised path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),        # Start in the start set
    (0.5, 9.5),        # Move up clear of the starting area 
    (2.0, 9.5),        # Move right 
    (2.0, 10.5),       # Move up further clear of obstacles 
    (4.0, 10.5),       # Move right 
    (4.0, 10.25),      # Small adjustment down
    (7.5, 10.25),      # Move right, staying clear of obstacles 
    (7.5, 7.0),        # Move down, preparing to navigate around obstacles 11 & 12
    (8.1, 7.0),        # Small move right, staying clear of obstacle 11
    (8.1, 8.75),       # Move up, staying clear of obstacle 10
    (9.0, 8.75),       # Move right, approaching the goal from a safer distance
    (9.0, 0.6)         # Move down to the goal, staying clear of all right-side obstacles
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Wider Berth:** The path now gives more space to obstacles on the right side, avoiding the close calls that caused intersections in the original path.
2. **Strategic Vertical Movement:** The path makes more deliberate vertical movements to get around obstacles, ensuring a clear path without cutting corners too closely.
3. **Direct Approach to the Goal:** Once past the obstacle field, the path takes a more direct approach to the goal, simplifying the trajectory and further reducing the risk of collisions.

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:11:07 AM] The previous path failed to avoid obstacles near the goal and ended outside of the goal set. Let's adjust it:

1. **Maintain previous path until (8.1, 7.0):** The path segments up to this point successfully avoid obstacles.

2. **Navigate around Obstacle 10:** Instead of going directly down, we'll add a waypoint to the left of Obstacle 10 at (8.1, 8.2).

3. **Descend and enter the goal set:** From (8.1, 8.2), we can safely move down to (9.5, 8.2), then to (9.5, 0.6), and finally to (9.5, 0.5) which lies within the goal set. 

Here's the corrected path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 9.5), 
    (2.0, 9.5), 
    (2.0, 10.5),

[08/22/2024 11:11:19 AM] The path is intersecting with obstacles in two main areas: near the top right corner and along the right edge. Let's break down the changes:

1. **Top Right Corner:**
   - The segment from (8.1, 8.2) to (9.5, 8.2) cuts through Obstacle 9. 
   - To fix this, we'll route the path to the right of Obstacle 9. 
   - We'll add a waypoint at (8.5, 8.6) to go above Obstacle 9 and then connect to the goal.

2. **Right Edge:**
   - The segment from (9.5, 8.2) to (9.5, 0.6) crosses Obstacles 11, 13, and 15. 
   - Instead of going straight down, we'll create a more meandering path to avoid these obstacles. 
   - After (9.5, 8.2), we'll add waypoints at (9.6, 7.0), (9.4, 6.0), (9.6, 5.0), (9.4, 4.0), (9.6, 3.0), and (9.4, 2.0) to weave around the obstacles.

    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

[08/22/2024 11:11:30 AM] The path needs adjustments to avoid colliding with obstacles 11, 13, and 15. 

- **Segment 11:** To avoid obstacle 11, we can add a waypoint to the left of it. Let's add (8.0, 8.6).
- **Segment 14:** Obstacle 13 can be avoided similarly by adding a waypoint to the left, such as (9.2, 5.0).
- **Segment 16:** Again, adding a waypoint to the left of obstacle 15 will help. We can add (9.2, 3.0).

Here's the modified path:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 9.5), (2.0, 9.5), (2.0, 10.5), (4.0, 10.5), (4.0, 10.25), (7.5, 10.25), (7.5, 7.0), (8.1, 7.0), (8.1, 8.6), (8.0, 8.6), (9.5, 8.6), (9.6, 7.0), (9.4, 6.0), (9.2, 5.0), (9.6, 5.0), (9.4, 4.0), (9.2, 3.0), (9.6, 3.0), (9.4, 2.0), (9.5, 0.5)]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:11:45 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate through a tight corridor on the right side of the environment, leading to collisions with obstacles 11, 13, 14, and 15.  To correct this, the path needs adjustments to create a wider berth around these obstacles. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 9.5), 
    (2.0, 9.5), 
    (2.0, 10.5), 
    (4.0, 10.5), 
    (4.0, 10.25), 
    (7.5, 10.25), 
    (7.5, 7.0), 
    (8.1, 7.0), 
    (8.1, 8.6), 
    (8.0, 8.6), 
    (9.1, 8.6),  # adjusted to stay clear of obstacle 11
    (9.1, 6.0),  # adjusted to stay clear of obstacles 11 and 12
    (9.5, 6.0),  # move to the right after clearing the obstacles 
    (9.5, 5.0),  # move down towards the goal, staying clear of obstacle 13
    (9.5, 4.0),  # continue moving down, staying clear of obstacle 14
    (9.5, 3.0),  # continue moving down, staying clear of obstacle 15
    (9.5, 0.5)   # final movement to reach the center of the goal area
]
```

The key changes are:

- **Staying further left while approaching from the top:** Instead of hugging the right edge, the path now stays further left, allowing for a wider turn to avoid obstacle 11.
- **Moving down centrally:** After clearing the top obstacles, the path moves down towards the goal while staying in a central position relative to the remaining obstacles. This avoids the need for tight turns and minimizes the risk of collision.

This revised path prioritizes smoother, more gradual turns and maintains a safer distance from obstacles, significantly reducing the likelihood of collisions.

[08/22/2024 11:11:58 AM] The initial path tries to navigate through a narrow passage between obstacles on the right side of the environment. However, several segments intersect with obstacles. To correct this, I'll adjust the path to take a wider route, going around the obstacles instead of squeezing between them. Here's a breakdown of the changes:

1. **Maintain High Clearance:** Instead of going down from (9.1, 8.6) to (9.1, 6.0), the path should stay clear of obstacles 10 and 12. This can be achieved by staying to the right of obstacle 10.

2. **Circumvent Obstacles:** The path should then curve around the bottom-right corner of obstacle 10 to avoid intersecting with obstacle 12.

3. **Clear Lower Obstacles:** Instead of a straight path from (9.5, 6.0) to (9.5, 0.5), the path should navigate around obstacles 13 and 15. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 9.5), 
    (2.0, 9.5), 
    (2.0, 10.5), 
    (4.0, 10.5), 
    (4.0, 10.25), 
    (7.5, 10.25), 
    (7.5, 7.0), 
    (8.1, 7.0), 
    (8.1, 8.6), 
    (8.0, 8.6), 
    (9.5, 8.6), # Stay right of Obstacle 10
    (9.5, 7.0), # Curve around Obstacle 10
    (9.5, 6.0), 
    (9.5, 5.0), 
    (9.8, 4.5), # Circumvent Obstacle 13
    (9.8, 3.0), # Stay right of Obstacle 15
    (9.5, 2.0), # Curve around Obstacle 15
    (9.5, 0.5)

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:12:09 AM] The initial path goes too far east before heading south towards the goal. This results in collisions with obstacles as it tries to navigate around obstacles 11, 13, and 15. 

To correct this, the path should be adjusted to hug the eastern edge of obstacle 8, then move south, staying clear of obstacles 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 before reaching the goal. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 9.5), 
    (2.0, 9.5), 
    (2.0, 10.5),

[08/22/2024 11:12:17 AM] The path intersects with Obstacle 9 because it tries to move directly from (8.0, 1.5) to (9.5, 0.5). To avoid this, we can add a waypoint to the right of Obstacle 9, allowing the path to go around it. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 9.5), (2.0, 9.5), (2.0, 10.5), (4.0, 10.5), (4.0, 10.25), (7.5, 10.25), (7.5, 7.0), (7.5, 6.0), (7.5, 5.0), (7.5, 4.0), (7.5, 3.0), (7.5, 2.0), (8.0, 1.5), (8.5, 1.5), (9.5, 0.5)]

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:12:27 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 9. To achieve this, we can reroute the path by going below Obstacle 9. 

Here's a possible adjustment:

Instead of directly moving from (7.5, 2.0) to (8.0, 1.5), we can add a waypoint at (7.5, 1.0) to first go below Obstacle 9. From there, we can proceed to (8.5, 1.0) and then (9.5, 0.5) to reach the goal set.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 9.5), (2.0, 9.5), (2.0, 10.5), (4.0, 10.5), (4.0, 10.25), (7.5, 10.25), (7.5, 7.0), (7.5, 6.0), (7.5, 5.0), (7.5, 4.0), (7.5, 3.0), (7.5, 2.0), (7.5, 1.0), (8.5, 1.0), (9.5, 0.5)]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 9.5), (2.0, 9.5), (2.0, 10.5), (4.0, 10.5), (4.0, 10.25), (7.5, 10.25), (7.5, 7.0), (7.5, 6.0), (7.5, 5.0), (7.5, 4.0), (7.5, 3.0), (7.5, 2.0), (7.5, 1.0), (8.0, 1.0), (8.0, 9.0), (8.0, 0.6)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    Obstacle Avoidance (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
No intersections found. You avoided all obstacles!
    End set: Incorrect, The path does not end inside the goal set [[9.7, 0.8], [9.3, 0.8], [9.3, 0.4], [9.7, 0.4]].

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Goal Position: End within the specified rectangular goal set.
Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 11:13:06 AM] The provided path successfully navigates through the obstacles but ends prematurely before reaching the goal set. To rectify this, we'll extend the path from (8.0, 0.6) towards the goal set. 

Examining the obstacles near the goal set, we see obstacles 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 form a barrier.  The goal set is on the right side of this barrier, and the current path ends on the left. Therefore, we need to find a way around this barrier.

Looking at the top of the barrier, we can see a clear path above obstacle 10. We can navigate to this opening by continuing straight up from the current endpoint. From there, we can move right, bypassing obstacle 10 and entering the goal set.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 9.5), 
    (2.0, 9.5), 
    (2.0, 10.5), 
    (4.0, 10.5), 
    (4.0, 10.25), 
    (7.5, 10.25), 
    (7.5, 7.0), 
    (7.5, 6.0), 
    (7.5, 5.0), 
    (7.5, 4.0), 
    (7.5, 3.0), 
    (7.5, 2.0), 
    (7.5, 1.0), 
    (8.0, 1.0), 
    (8.0, 9.0), 
    (8.0, 0.6),
    (8.0, 8.6), # Move upwards to clear obstacle 10
    (9.5, 8.6), # Move rightwards towards the goal set
    (9.5, 0.6) # Move downwards to enter the goal set
]
