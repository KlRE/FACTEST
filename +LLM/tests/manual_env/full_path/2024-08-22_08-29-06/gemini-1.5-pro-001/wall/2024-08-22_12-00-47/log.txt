# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.0, 1.0], [8.0, 1.0], [8.0, -0.0], [9.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 12:00:53 PM] The obstacle presents a significant challenge as it creates a diagonal barrier across the most direct path from the start to the goal. To navigate this, the path needs to move either above or below the obstacle.

Let's consider a path that goes below the obstacle:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start within the start set.
    (0.5, -2.0),  # Move downwards, clearing the lowest point of the obstacle by a safe margin.
    (9.0, -2.0),  # Move rightwards, maintaining a safe distance below the obstacle.
    (8.5, -0.5)   # Move upwards to end within the goal set.
]
```

This path avoids any intersection with the obstacle by maintaining a clear distance below it throughout its trajectory.

[08/22/2024 12:01:16 PM] The problem is that the straight line segment between (0.5, 2.0) and (7.0, 2.0) cuts through Obstacle 1. To fix this, we need to route the path around this obstacle. 

Here's how we can adjust the path:

1. **Go below the obstacle:** Instead of going directly across at y = 2.0, we can navigate below Obstacle 1. 

Taking these points into consideration, a new path could be:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start point
    (0.5, -1.0), # Move down, clearing Obstacle 1
    (7.0, -1.0), # Move right, staying below Obstacle 1 
    (8.5, 0.5)   # Move to the end point within the goal set
]
```

This new path avoids intersecting Obstacle 1 by going underneath it.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/22/2024 12:01:21 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid the obstacle. The problematic segment is between (0.5, -1.0) and (7.0, -1.0) which cuts through the obstacle. 

To avoid this, we can route the path above the obstacle. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```python
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 4.5),   # Move upward, clearing the obstacle's highest Y coordinate
    (7.0, 4.5),   # Move rightward, staying above the obstacle
    (8.5, 0.5)    # Move diagonally down to the goal within the goal set
]
```

This path first moves upward to a point that's clearly above the obstacle, then proceeds horizontally to the right, staying clear of the obstacle, and finally moves diagonally down into the goal set.
