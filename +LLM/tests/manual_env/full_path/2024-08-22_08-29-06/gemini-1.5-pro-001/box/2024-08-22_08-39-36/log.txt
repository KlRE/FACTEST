# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:39:39 AM] The provided obstacle creates a channel funneling upwards from the start set to the goal set. The path can simply move through this channel. 

new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75), # start in the start set
    (1.75, 6.0), # move upwards to be above the obstacle
    (9.0, 9.0) # move diagonally to end in the goal set

[08/22/2024 08:39:43 AM] The path needs to navigate around Obstacle 1. It seems like the initial attempt tried to go over, then through the obstacle. 

I will adjust the path to first move right, going around the left side of the obstacle, before moving upwards and heading towards the goal.

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 1.75),   # Move left to avoid the obstacle
    (0.5, 6.0),    # Move upwards, clear of the obstacle
    (9.0, 9.0)     # Move towards the goal within the goal set
]

]

[08/22/2024 08:39:49 AM] The issue lies in the third segment of the path which crosses Obstacle 1. To address this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle. 

Given Obstacle 1's position, we can guide the path above it. This requires two adjustments:

1. **Reaching a point above Obstacle 1:** From (0.5, 6.0), the path needs to move vertically upwards to a point where it can safely bypass the obstacle.  A y-value greater than the obstacle's highest y-coordinate (9.0 in this case) is necessary. 

2. **Connecting to the goal:**  After clearing the obstacle, the path can proceed horizontally towards the goal position.

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75), 
    (0.5, 1.75), 
    (0.5, 6.0), 
    (0.5, 9.5),  # Move upwards to clear Obstacle 1
    (9.0, 9.5)   # Move rightwards towards the goal
]
```
