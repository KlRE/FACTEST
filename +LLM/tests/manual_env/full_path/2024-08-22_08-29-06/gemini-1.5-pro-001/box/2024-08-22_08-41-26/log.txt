# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.

    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:41:30 AM] The provided obstacle spans diagonally across the environment, creating two clear areas: one above and one below it.  The path can utilize either of these areas. This explanation will focus on a path above the obstacle.

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:41:36 AM] The path needs to navigate around the obstacle, which forms a large square 'C' shape open to the top-left. 

The initial path attempts to cross the obstacle horizontally and then vertically. To avoid this, the path should instead go above the obstacle. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),    # Start within the start set
    (1.75, 10.0),   # Move upwards, going above the obstacle
    (9.0, 10.0),   # Move rightwards, staying above the obstacle 
    (9.0, 9.0)     # Move down into the goal set
]
```

This path first moves upwards to a point that's clearly above the obstacle, then moves rightwards to a point vertically aligned with the goal, and finally moves down into the goal set. This avoids any intersection with the obstacle.

[08/22/2024 08:41:42 AM] The initial path goes straight up from the start set, directly into Obstacle 1. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle. Since the obstacle is a rectangle tilted at 45 degrees, we can go around it in a sort of 'staircase' pattern.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),   # Start Point
    (3.0, 1.75),   # Move right, staying clear of Obstacle 1
    (3.0, 5.5),    # Move up, clearing the top of Obstacle 1 
    (9.0, 5.5),    # Move right, towards the goal set
    (9.0, 9.0)     # Move up into the goal set
]
```

This path moves right to avoid the lower portion of Obstacle 1, then moves up to clear its top edge before proceeding horizontally towards the goal.

]

[08/22/2024 08:41:47 AM] The original path crosses the obstacle because it goes straight through the middle. To avoid this, the path needs to go around the obstacle. Since the obstacle is shaped like a diamond, the path can go either above or below it. 

To go above, the path can move up from the start point and then go right to reach the goal set. To go below, the path can move right from the start point, then go down below the obstacle, and then move up to the goal set. 

Let's choose to go above the obstacle. 

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start within the start set

[08/22/2024 08:42:12 AM] The current path attempts to cross the obstacle directly. It needs to navigate around the obstacle to reach the goal.

1. **Start:** The starting point (1.75, 1.75) is good as it's inside the start set.
2. **Avoiding the obstacle:** Instead of moving up directly, we can move diagonally to a point above the top-left corner of the obstacle, then horizontally to clear it. A suitable point would be (6.0, 6.0). 
3. **Reaching the goal:** From (6.0, 6.0), we can move directly to the goal point (9.0, 9.0).

Here's the adjusted path:

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:42:18 AM] The current path intersects the obstacle because it attempts to move diagonally across the environment.  We need to adjust the path to navigate around the obstacle. 

To do this, we can:

1. **Start:** Keep the starting point within the start set.
2. **Navigate Upwards:** Move vertically upwards to a y-coordinate greater than the obstacle's maximum y-coordinate. This ensures we clear the obstacle.
3. **Move Right:**  Move horizontally towards the goal set, now that we are above the obstacle.
4. **Descend to Goal:** Finally, move downwards to reach a point within the goal set. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),   # Start within the start set
    (1.75, 6.0),   # Move upwards to be above the obstacle
    (9.0, 6.0),   # Move right towards the goal set
    (9.0, 9.0)    # Move down to end inside the goal set

```

This path avoids the obstacle by going around it.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

    
## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.75, 1.75), (1.75, 6.0), (9.0, 6.0), (9.0, 9.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    Obstacle Avoidance (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
		Segment 1 between points (1.75, 1.75) and (1.75, 6.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]
		Segment 2 between points (1.75, 6.0) and (9.0, 6.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:42:36 AM] The path intersects with the obstacle primarily because it tries to move horizontally across the environment. A better strategy would be to move above the obstacle first and then head towards the goal. 

Here's a possible path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),    # Start within the start set
    (1.75, 6.0),     # Move vertically upward, clearing the obstacle 
    (9.0, 6.0),      # Move horizontally towards the goal set
    (9.0, 9.0)       # Move vertically to end within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(1.75, 1.75):** We start at this point within the start set.
2. **(1.75, 6.0):** We move vertically upward to a point where the y-coordinate is greater than the obstacle's maximum y-coordinate, effectively going above it.
3. **(9.0, 6.0):**  From this position above the obstacle, we can safely move horizontally towards the goal set. 
4. **(9.0, 9.0):** Finally, we move vertically downward to reach a point within the goal set. 

This path avoids the obstacle by strategically maneuvering around it.

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:42:40 AM] The original path attempted to move directly right and then up towards the goal. However, this is blocked by Obstacle 1. To correct this, the path needs to first move upwards, navigating around the left side of Obstacle 1 before heading towards the goal.

Here's a possible corrected path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),    # Start within the start set
    (1.75, 6.0),     # Move upwards, clearing Obstacle 1
    (9.0, 6.0),      # Move rightwards towards the goal set
    (9.0, 9.0)       # End within the goal set
]
```

This path addresses the obstacle collision by first moving vertically to a point where a clear horizontal path to the goal exists.

[08/22/2024 08:43:29 AM] The original path attempted to navigate directly to the goal, colliding with Obstacle 1 in the process.  To circumvent this, we need a path that goes around the obstacle. One approach is to skirt along the edge of the obstacle.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start within the start set
    (1.75, 0.5),  # Move down, clearing the bottom edge of Obstacle 1
    (9.5, 0.5),  # Move right, staying clear of Obstacle 1 
    (9.5, 9.0)   # Move up to the goal within the goal set 
]
```

This path first moves down to avoid the obstacle entirely, then proceeds right towards the goal, and finally moves up to reach the goal set. This ensures no collision with Obstacle 1.
