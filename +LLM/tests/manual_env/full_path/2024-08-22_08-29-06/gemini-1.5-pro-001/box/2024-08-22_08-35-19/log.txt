# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:35:23 AM] The provided obstacle stretches from y = 1.0 to y = 9.0 and spans from x = 1.0 to x = 9.0, effectively creating a channel on its right side leading to the goal set.

Therefore, the path can be planned to go around the obstacle and stay close to the edge to reach the goal.

new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.75),    # Start within the start set
    (9.25, 1.75),   # Move right, maintaining a safe distance from the obstacle
    (9.25, 9.0)     # Move up to the goal set

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:35:29 AM] The current path attempts to move horizontally across the environment, but intersects with Obstacle 1. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle.

One approach is to move above Obstacle 1:

1. **Start:** Keep the starting point (2.0, 1.75).
2. **Move Up:** Travel vertically upwards to a point above Obstacle 1. Since Obstacle 1's highest point has a y-coordinate of 5.0, we need to move to a y-coordinate greater than 5.0. Let's choose (2.0, 5.5). 
3. **Move Right:** Travel horizontally to a point above the goal set. Let's choose (9.25, 5.5).
4. **Move Down:** Travel vertically downwards to reach the goal set. We can keep the endpoint (9.25, 9.0).

Here is the corrected path:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.75),
    (2.0, 5.5),
    (9.25, 5.5),
    (9.25, 9.0)

{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:35:35 AM] The main issue with the previous path was that it attempted to move directly to the right while being on the same y-level as the obstacle, resulting in a collision. To avoid this, we need to navigate around the obstacle. 

First, we move upwards from the start point to avoid the lower portion of the obstacle. 

Then, we can proceed rightwards, ensuring we are clear of the obstacle's x-coordinates before changing our y-direction to move towards the goal. 

Finally, we move downwards to enter the goal set.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.75),  # Start point within the start set
    (2.0, 6.0),  # Move upwards to a point clearly above the obstacle
    (9.25, 6.0),  # Move rightwards to a point aligned with the goal set
    (9.25, 9.0)   # Move downwards to the end point within the goal set
]

### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:35:43 AM] The initial path attempts to move directly upwards and then rightwards, resulting in collisions with Obstacle 1.  To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around the obstacle. One approach is to move leftwards first, clear of the obstacle, before proceeding upwards and then rightwards towards the goal.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.75),    # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 1.75),    # Move leftwards, clear of Obstacle 1
    (0.5, 6.0),     # Move upwards, clear of Obstacle 1
    (9.25, 6.0),    # Move rightwards towards the goal
    (9.25, 9.0)     # End within the goal set
]
```

This path avoids Obstacle 1 by first moving leftwards and then proceeding upwards before moving towards the goal.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

[08/22/2024 08:36:21 AM] The issue lies in the segment connecting (0.5, 6.0) and (9.25, 6.0), which cuts through Obstacle 1. 

To circumvent this, we can reroute the path by going around the obstacle.  We'll exploit the fact that the obstacle doesn't extend past the y-value of 9.0.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.75),  # Start point (unchanged)
    (0.5, 1.75),  # Intermediate point (unchanged)
    (0.5, 9.5),  # Move vertically upwards, clearing the obstacle 
    (9.25, 9.5),  # Move horizontally towards the goal set
    (9.25, 9.0)   # End point (unchanged)
]
```

This new path first moves upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 1, and then proceeds horizontally towards the goal. This avoids any intersection with the obstacle.
