# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:33:07 AM] The provided environment features a large obstacle spanning from the bottom to the top of the space. To reach the goal, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle.

One approach is to guide the path above the obstacle:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),    # Start within the start set
    (1.75, 6.0),     # Move upwards, clearing the obstacle's top boundary
    (9.0,  6.0),     # Move right, maintaining a safe distance from the obstacle 
    (9.0,  9.0)      # Move down to a point within the goal set 
]
```

This path ensures a safe distance from the obstacle while successfully navigating from the start to the goal.

[08/22/2024 08:33:14 AM] The initial path goes straight up from the starting point and intersects with Obstacle 1. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle. 

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Starting Point:** We can start from the same point (1.75, 1.75).
2. **Going Right:**  Since Obstacle 1 stretches from y-coordinate 1.0 to 9.0, we need to move right, clear of the obstacle's x-coordinate range (1.0 to 9.0), before moving upwards. Let's move to (9.5, 1.75).
3. **Moving Upwards:**  Now we can safely move upwards towards the goal set. Let's go to (9.5, 9.0).
4. **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, move left into the goal set at (9.0, 9.0).

Therefore, the updated path is:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75), 
    (9.5, 1.75),  
    (9.5, 9.0),
    (9.0, 9.0)

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:33:25 AM] The path needs to navigate around Obstacle 1. We can achieve this by first moving upwards, then rightwards to avoid the obstacle, and finally upwards again to reach the goal.

**Here's the updated path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start within the start set
    (1.75, 7.0),  # Move upwards, clear of Obstacle 1 
    (9.5, 7.0),  # Move rightwards, staying clear of Obstacle 1
    (9.5, 9.0)   # Move upwards to reach the goal within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Upward Movement:** The first segment is adjusted to move significantly upwards to `y=7.0`, ensuring a safe distance from Obstacle 1's top vertex at `y=5.0`.
2. **Rightward Movement:** The second segment now moves horizontally to the right, aligning with the goal's x-coordinate (`x=9.5`). 
3. **Final Approach:** The final segment moves upwards to the goal point, remaining within the safe channel created by the previous movements. 

This adjusted path successfully avoids Obstacle 1 while adhering to the start and end set requirements.

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:33:31 AM] The original path attempts to go up and over the obstacle, but intersects on the way up and across. Instead, we can navigate around the obstacle to the right. 

1. **Starting Point:** Keep the starting point at (1.75, 1.75).

2. **Navigate Right:**  Move horizontally to the right, clear of the obstacle. Let's aim for a point like (6.0, 1.75) to be safe. 

3. **Move Upwards:** From (6.0, 1.75), travel vertically upwards to a point above the obstacle and on the same y-level as the goal, such as (6.0, 9.0).

4. **Reach the Goal:**  Finally, move horizontally to the left to reach the goal point within the goal set,  (9.0, 9.0).

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75), 
    (6.0, 1.75),  
    (6.0, 9.0),

]

[08/22/2024 08:33:37 AM] The original path intersects with the obstacle. To fix this, the path needs to move above the obstacle. 

1. **Start:** The starting point (1.75, 1.75) is fine.
2. **Move Above the Obstacle:** Instead of moving directly to the right, let's move up to a y-coordinate greater than 5 (the highest point of the obstacle) to avoid a collision. A good waypoint would be (1.75, 6.0).
3. **Move Right:** Now, we can safely move to the right, passing above the obstacle. Let's aim for a point with an x-coordinate greater than 9.0 (the rightmost point of the obstacle). A suitable waypoint is (9.5, 6.0).
4. **Move Down to Goal:** Finally, move down to the goal area. The point (9.5, 9.0) is a good choice within the goal set.

Therefore, the corrected path is:

```
new_path = [

[08/22/2024 08:33:43 AM] The initial path attempts to go up and over the obstacle, but it intersects in two places. I will adjust the path to navigate around the left side of the obstacle instead.

1. **Start:** Keep the starting point at (1.75, 1.75).

2. **Navigate Left:**  To avoid the obstacle, I'll add a waypoint to the left of the obstacle, ensuring a safe distance. A suitable waypoint could be (0.5, 3.0).

[08/22/2024 08:34:20 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid crossing Obstacle 1. Since the obstacle forms a diagonal barrier, the best approach is to navigate around it. 

1. **Maintain Start:** The starting point (1.75, 1.75) is valid.
2. **Navigate Below:** Instead of going up directly, we can move below Obstacle 1.
3. **Clear Obstacle:** Move to a point with an x-coordinate greater than 9.0 to be clear of the obstacle.
4. **Reach Goal:**  Finally, move upwards to the goal point (9.5, 9.0).

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75), 
    (1.75, 0.5), 
    (9.5, 0.5), 
    (9.5, 9.0)
]
```
