# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:43:39 AM] The provided environment has a single, large obstacle that effectively forms a wall dividing the space diagonally. 

To reach the goal, the path needs to navigate around this "wall".  One approach is to go upwards, clear the obstacle, and then proceed towards the goal.

Here's a possible path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),    # Start within the start set
    (1.75, 6.0),     # Move upwards to clear the obstacle
    (9.0, 9.0)      # Move diagonally to the center of the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(1.75, 1.75):**  This starting point is chosen from within the start set.
2. **(1.75, 6.0):** This waypoint moves the path vertically upwards, ensuring a safe distance from the top vertex of the obstacle at (9.0, 5.0).
3. **(9.0, 9.0):** This final waypoint is within the goal set, successfully completing the path.

This path avoids crossing the obstacle and maintains a safe distance, fulfilling the requirements of the task.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:43:46 AM] The original path fails because it tries to cross the obstacle directly. We need to find a way around.

1. **Starting Point:** Keep the starting point at (1.75, 1.75) as it's safely within the start set.

2. **Navigating the Obstacle:** Obstacle 1 spans from x=1 to x=9 and y=1 to y=9. To avoid it, we can move above its y=9 boundary.

3. **Waypoint Above Obstacle:** Introduce a waypoint at (1.75, 9.5). This takes us directly upwards, clear of the obstacle.

4. **Reaching the Goal:** From (1.75, 9.5), we can move horizontally to the right to reach the goal set. Let's use (9.0, 9.5) which falls within the goal set.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75), 
    (1.75, 9.5), 
    (9.0, 9.5)
]
```

This path moves straight up from the start point to avoid the obstacle, then straight right to reach the goal.

[08/22/2024 08:43:55 AM] The original path attempts to cross the obstacle directly. 
- We need to find a way around the obstacle to reach the goal. 
- Since the obstacle forms a square-like shape, we can go either above or below it. 

Considering the goal position, going above the obstacle seems like a more efficient approach. 

Here's a possible modified path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Starting point within the start set
    (1.75, 6.0),  # Move vertically upwards, clearing the obstacle's highest Y point
    (9.0, 6.0),  # Move horizontally towards the goal set
    (9.0, 9.5)   # Move vertically to reach the desired endpoint within the goal set
]
```

This path avoids the obstacle by going above it, ensuring a clear and collision-free trajectory.

[08/22/2024 08:44:00 AM] The initial path goes through the obstacle. To fix this, the path needs to go around obstacle 1. There's enough space to go above it.

2.  **Going Up:** Move straight up to a point above the obstacle, for example (1.75, 6.0).
3.  **Moving Right:**  Move right, staying above the obstacle, until you are past it, for example to (9.0, 6.0).
4.  **Reaching the Goal:** Now move down to a point inside the goal set, for example, (9.0, 9.5).

[08/22/2024 08:44:18 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate directly to the goal set, but in doing so, it intersects with Obstacle 1. To correct this, the path needs to move around the obstacle.

1. **Starting Point:** The initial starting point (1.75, 1.75) is good as it's already positioned to avoid the lower left corner of Obstacle 1.

2. **Navigating around Obstacle 1:**  Instead of moving directly upwards, the path should move rightwards, staying below the y-coordinate of 5.0 (the upper bound of Obstacle 1), until it clears the obstacle.

3. **Reaching the Goal Set:** Once clear of Obstacle 1, the path can then proceed upwards and then leftwards to reach the goal set.

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start
    (5.5, 1.75),  # Move rightward, staying below Obstacle 1

[08/22/2024 08:44:24 AM] The current path attempts to move directly from the start to the goal, intersecting the obstacle. 
To avoid this, we need to route the path around the obstacle. 

Since the obstacle forms a square shape from (1, 5) to (5, 1) and (5, 9) to (9, 5), we can navigate around it by going "above" or "below".  Let's choose to go "above".

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start point
    (1.75, 5.5),  # Move upwards, clearing the obstacle 
    (9.0, 5.5),   # Move rightwards towards the goal 
    (9.0, 9.5)    # Move upwards to reach the goal
]
```

]

[08/22/2024 08:44:30 AM] The primary issue with the initial path is that it cuts directly through Obstacle 1. To rectify this, we need to navigate around this obstacle. 

Considering the obstacle's shape and position, the optimal strategy is to guide the path above its upper boundary (y = 5.0). 

Let's modify the path with the following waypoints:

1.  **(1.75, 1.75):** Start point, remains unchanged.
2.  **(1.75, 5.5):** Move vertically upward, ensuring to stay above the obstacle with a y-value greater than 5.0. 
3.  **(9.0, 5.5):** Move horizontally towards the goal set, maintaining the same y-value to stay clear of the obstacle.
4.  **(9.0, 9.5):**  Move vertically upward to reach the desired endpoint within the goal set.

Therefore, the adjusted path is as follows:

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

    Obstacle Avoidance (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
		Segment 1 between points (1.75, 1.75) and (1.75, 5.5) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]
		Segment 2 between points (1.75, 5.5) and (9.0, 5.5) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:44:35 AM] The initial path attempts to move directly to the right and then upwards, but this leads to collisions with Obstacle 1. 

To circumvent this, the path needs to navigate around Obstacle 1. One approach is to move upwards first, clear of Obstacle 1's topmost y-coordinate, then proceed rightwards towards the goal.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  // Start within the start set
    (1.75, 6.0),  // Move upwards, clearing Obstacle 1's y-coordinate range
    (9.0, 6.0),  // Move rightwards, staying clear of Obstacle 1
    (9.0, 9.5)   // Move downwards to reach the goal set 
]
```

This adjusted path ensures that all segments remain clear of Obstacle 1.

]

[08/22/2024 08:44:42 AM] The original path attempted to move directly upwards and then rightwards, but this is obstructed by Obstacle 1. To circumvent this, the path needs to navigate around the obstacle. 

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Start:** (1.75, 1.75) -  This starting point is within the start set.

2. **Move Right:**  Since going up directly leads to a collision, move towards the right side of the start set, away from Obstacle 1. A suitable point could be (2.0, 1.75).

3. **Move Upwards:** Now that there's ample space, move upwards, clearing the y-coordinate of Obstacle 1. A possible waypoint is (2.0, 6.0).

4. **Move Rightwards:** With Obstacle 1 cleared, move right towards the goal set. A suitable point would be (9.0, 6.0).

5. **Reach the Goal:** Finally, move down into the goal set.  The endpoint can be (9.0, 9.0).

Therefore, the revised path is:

```
new_path = [(1.75, 1.75), (2.0, 1.75), (2.0, 6.0), (9.0, 6.0), (9.0, 9.0)]

[08/22/2024 08:45:26 AM] The primary issue with the initial path is that it attempts to navigate through the obstacle rather than around it.  The obstacle forms a square "wall" from x=1 to x=9 and y=1 to y=9.

To rectify this, the path needs to be adjusted to go around this obstacle. One approach is to move along the outside edge of the obstacle.

Here's a possible revised path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),   # Start within the start set
    (1.0, 1.75),   # Move outside the obstacle's left edge 
    (1.0, 9.5),    # Move up, clearing the obstacle
    (9.5, 9.5)     # Move right to the goal set 
]
```

This path starts within the start set, navigates around the obstacle by going along its left edge, and then proceeds to the goal set. Each segment of this path avoids intersecting the obstacle.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.75, 1.75), (1.0, 1.75), (1.0, 9.5), (9.5, 9.5)]

    Obstacle Avoidance (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
		Segment 2 between points (1.0, 1.75) and (1.0, 9.5) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:45:30 AM] The feedback correctly pointed out that the second segment of the path intersects with Obstacle 1. To avoid this, we need to navigate around the obstacle. 

The path needs to move upwards to clear the obstacle, then right to approach the goal, and finally upwards again to reach the goal set.  

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Starting point
    (1.75, 6.0),  # Move upwards to clear the obstacle 
    (9.5, 6.0),  # Move rightwards towards the goal

]

[08/22/2024 08:45:35 AM] The initial path attempts to move directly upwards and then rightwards towards the goal. However, this leads to collisions with Obstacle 1, which forms a large square shape in the space. 

To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle. One strategy is to move to the right, clear of the obstacle, and then proceed upwards.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),    # Start within the start set
    (6.0, 1.75),    # Move rightwards, clear of Obstacle 1 
    (6.0, 9.5),     # Move upwards, clear of Obstacle 1
    (9.5, 9.5)      # Reach the goal within the goal set
]
```

This path first moves horizontally to a point where it's to the right of Obstacle 1. Then, it proceeds vertically upwards to reach the goal set. This avoids any intersections with the obstacle.

[08/22/2024 08:45:41 AM] The path goes through obstacle 1. To fix this, the path needs to go around obstacle 1. 

1.  The path can first move left to  `(1.75, 0.5)`. This avoids going through the bottom part of the obstacle.
2. From there, the path can go up to `(1.75, 6.0)`. This brings the path to a point where it can safely move to the right.
3. The path can then proceed to `(6.0, 6.0)`.
4. Finally, the path can move down to `(6.0, 9.5)` and then reach the goal at `(9.5, 9.5)`.

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:45:46 AM] The primary issue with the previous path was that it attempted to move through the obstacle. To rectify this, the path needs to navigate around the obstacle.

Starting from (1.75, 1.75), we can move to the right, staying clear of the obstacle's leftmost x-coordinate (1.0). Let's aim for x = 6.0, which is clear of the obstacle. From there, we can move up to the goal's y-coordinate. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start point
    (6.0, 1.75),  # Move right, clear of the obstacle
    (6.0, 9.5),  # Move up to the goal's y-coordinate
    (9.5, 9.5)   # Move right to the goal point
]

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:45:52 AM] The original path intersects with Obstacle 1 because it tries to go directly to the goal. 

To circumvent this, we can route the path above the obstacle. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start within the start set
    (1.75, 6.0),  # Move upward, clearing Obstacle 1's highest Y
    (6.0, 6.0),  # Move rightward, staying clear of Obstacle 1
    (6.0, 9.5),  # Move downward towards the goal set
    (9.5, 9.5)   # End within the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **(1.75, 6.0):** We move upward from the start point to a Y-coordinate higher than Obstacle 1's upper boundary.
2. **(6.0, 6.0):** From this elevated position, we move rightward, ensuring we're clear of Obstacle 1's rightmost X-coordinate.
3. **(6.0, 9.5):** Now safely past the obstacle, we move down towards the goal set. 

This revised path navigates the environment successfully, avoiding any intersection with Obstacle 1.

    (9.5, 9.5)      # Move right to reach the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(1.75, 1.75):** Start within the start set.
2. **(5.5, 1.75):** Move rightward, ensuring we stay below the lower boundary of Obstacle 1.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/22/2024 08:46:27 AM] The original path attempts to go over and through the obstacle. It must go around.

1. **Starting Point:**  We'll keep the starting point (1.75, 1.75).

2. **Navigating the Obstacle:** The obstacle occupies a large portion of the center of the space. We'll need to navigate around it. Let's go below it:

    * **Waypoint 2:** Move right, staying below the obstacle: (5.5, 1).

3. **Reaching the Goal:** Now we're clear of the obstacle and can move towards the goal:

    * **Waypoint 3:** Move upwards to the goal's y-level: (5.5, 9.5) 
    * **Waypoint 4:** Move right to reach the goal: (9.5, 9.5)

**New Path:**

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

    
## Your generated path:

[08/22/2024 08:46:31 AM] The path needs to navigate around the obstacle that stretches across a large portion of the space. It's crucial to find waypoints that allow the path to move around this obstacle without intersecting it.

Instead of directly moving towards the goal, the path can first navigate below the obstacle, then proceed towards the goal. 

Here's the updated path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start within the start set
    (1.75, 0.5),  # Move downwards below the obstacle
    (9.5, 0.5),  # Move rightwards, staying below the obstacle
    (9.5, 9.5)   # Move upwards to the goal set 
]
```
