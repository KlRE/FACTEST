# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:34:26 AM] The provided obstacle stretches from y = 1.0 to y = 9.0 and spans from x = 1.0 to x= 9.0, essentially forming a square shape that encompasses both the start and goal areas. 

Therefore, it's impossible to draw a path that starts within the start set and reaches the goal set without intersecting this obstacle. 

No path can be provided without intersecting the obstacle.

[08/22/2024 08:34:36 AM] The provided environment has a single obstacle forming a diamond shape. The path needs to navigate from the start region, around this obstacle, and reach the goal region.

Here's a possible path considering the obstacle's position:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.75),    # Start within the start set
    (2.0, 6.0),     # Move upwards, clearing the obstacle vertically
    (9.0, 6.0),     # Move rightwards, maintaining a safe distance from the obstacle 
    (9.0, 9.0)      # Move downwards to end within the goal set
]
```

This path avoids crossing the obstacle by moving upwards and creating enough clearance before proceeding horizontally towards the goal.

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:34:44 AM] The original path attempts to move directly upwards and then rightwards.  This fails because Obstacle 1 blocks the entire path on the right side of the start set.  To circumvent this, the path needs to first move left to a point where it can clear all obstacles when traveling right.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.75),   # Start within the start set
    (0.0, 1.75),   # Move left, clearing the x-range of the obstacle
    (0.0, 6.0),    # Move upwards to be above the obstacle
    (9.0, 6.0),    # Move rightwards towards the goal
    (9.0, 9.0)     # Move down to the desired end point within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(2.0, 1.75) -> (0.0, 1.75):**  Move directly left to avoid the rightward obstacle (Obstacle 1). 
2. **(0.0, 1.75) -> (0.0, 6.0):** Move straight up to a y-coordinate that's safely above Obstacle 1.
3. **(0.0, 6.0) -> (9.0, 6.0):** Now clear of the obstacle, move directly right towards the goal area.
4. **(9.0, 6.0) -> (9.0, 9.0):**  Finally, move straight down to reach the desired end point within the goal set. 

This adjusted path avoids crossing Obstacle 1 by navigating around it.

]

[08/22/2024 08:34:50 AM] The feedback correctly points out that the segment (0.0, 6.0) to (9.0, 6.0) crosses Obstacle 1. To fix this, we need to navigate around this obstacle. 

One approach is to go below the obstacle. We can do this by adding a waypoint between (0.0, 1.75) and (0.0, 6.0) that takes us below the obstacle's lowest y-coordinate. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.75),  # Start inside the start set
    (0.0, 1.75),  # Move left 
    (0.0, 0.5),  # Move down, staying below Obstacle 1
    (9.0, 0.5),  # Move right, staying below Obstacle 1
    (9.0, 9.0)   # Move up to the goal set 
]
```

This path first moves left to avoid the starting area, then goes down to clear Obstacle 1, and then proceeds safely to the goal.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

[08/22/2024 08:35:19 AM] The issue is that the path directly crosses the obstacle to reach the goal.  To fix this, we can adjust the path to go around the obstacle. We can achieve this by adding waypoints.

1. **Initial path analysis:** The path starts fine and goes up clearly of the obstacle. The problem is the long straight line from (0.0, 9.0) to (9.0, 9.0), as this line cuts through the obstacle. 

2. **Identifying a safe passage:**  We need to route the path around the obstacle. Since the obstacle is a rectangle slanted in the environment, we can go around it either above or below. For this solution, let's go below. 

3. **Choosing waypoints:** We need to add waypoints that navigate us below the obstacle.  We'll maintain a y-value that keeps us safely below the lowest point of the obstacle. Looking at the obstacle's coordinates, its lowest y-value is 1.0.  To be safe, let's aim for a y-value of 0.5.  This means we'll need to adjust our x-values to go around the obstacle as well.

4. **New path:** Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (2.0, 1.75),    # Start within the start set (unchanged)
    (0.0, 1.75),    # Move left (unchanged)
    (0.0, 0.5),     # Move down, clearing the obstacle's lowest point
    (9.5, 0.5),     # Move right, staying clear of the obstacle
    (9.5, 9.0)      # Move up to the goal position
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

* **(0.0, 0.5):**  This waypoint takes us directly south, ensuring we are well below the obstacle.
* **(9.5, 0.5):** This waypoint keeps us at the same safe y-value while moving us horizontally to align with our goal position. 
* **(9.5, 9.0):** From here, we can safely move north into our goal position. 

This adjusted path successfully avoids the obstacle and reaches the goal.
