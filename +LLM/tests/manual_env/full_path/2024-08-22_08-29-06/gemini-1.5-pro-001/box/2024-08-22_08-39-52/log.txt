# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.

[08/22/2024 08:40:18 AM] The provided obstacle spans diagonally across the space, dividing it into two sections. The start position lies in the bottom left section, while the goal position resides in the top right section.

A viable path involves navigating around the obstacle. 

Here's a possible path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),    # Start within the start set
    (1.75, 6.0),     # Move upwards, staying clear of the obstacle 
    (10.0, 6.0),    # Move rightwards, maintaining distance from the obstacle
    (9.0, 9.0)      # Move down into the goal set
]
```

This path avoids crossing the obstacle by navigating around it, first moving upwards, then rightwards, and finally downwards to reach the goal set.

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:40:25 AM] The primary issue with the initial path is that it attempts to navigate through obstacle 1. To correct this, we need to find a path around this obstacle.

**Analyzing the environment:**

- **Start Set:** We can start from the provided point (1.75, 1.75).
- **Obstacle 1:** This obstacle forms a large square-like shape spanning from y-coordinate 1.0 to 9.0 and blocking direct paths to the right.
- **Goal Set:**  Located in the upper-right area (x>8.5, y>8.5).

**Path Correction:**

1. **Navigate Above Obstacle 1:** Since the obstacle spans a large portion of the y-axis, the most efficient way to reach the goal is by going above it. 
2. **Move Right:** Once above the obstacle, we can move directly right towards the goal.
3. **Descend to Goal:** Finally, we descend to a point within the goal set.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),   // Start Point
    (1.75, 9.5),   // Move above Obstacle 1 
    (9.5,  9.5)    // Move right and reach the Goal Point 
]
```

This path avoids obstacle 1 by navigating above it, ensuring a collision-free trajectory to the goal.

[08/22/2024 08:40:30 AM] The initial path goes straight up from the start set, intersecting obstacle 1. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle. 

Since the goal is to the right and up, the path can move to the right, clear of obstacle 1, then proceed upwards to the goal.

Here's a possible new path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),    # Start within the start set
    (6.0, 1.75),    # Move right, clear of obstacle 1

[08/22/2024 08:40:38 AM] The initial path attempts to go over the obstacle, which is incorrect. A better approach would be to go around the obstacle.

**Corrected Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start point
    (1.75, 6.0),   # Move upwards to clear the obstacle
    (6.0, 6.0),   # Move rightwards 
    (6.0, 9.0),   # Move upwards to align with the goal
    (9.0, 9.0)    # Move rightwards to reach the goal
]
```

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Identify Obstacle:** The obstacle (Obstacle 1) spans from x=1 to x=9 and from y=1 to y=9, effectively blocking a direct path to the goal.

2. **Find a Clear Path:**  To avoid the obstacle, the path needs to navigate around it. 

3. **Navigate Around Obstacle:**
    * From the start point (1.75, 1.75), move vertically upwards to a y-coordinate greater than the obstacle's maximum y-coordinate (y=5). This leads to the waypoint (1.75, 6.0).
    * Move rightwards to a x-coordinate greater than the obstacle's maximum x-coordinate (x=5), reaching waypoint (6.0, 6.0).

4. **Reach the Goal:** 
    * Move upwards to align with the goal's y-coordinate (9.0), arriving at (6.0, 9.0).
    * Finally, move rightwards to reach the goal point (9.0, 9.0).

This new path successfully circumvents the obstacle while adhering to the specified constraints.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements

    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:40:43 AM] The original path attempts to go directly to the goal, colliding with Obstacle 1 along the way. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around the obstacle.

One solution is to go around the obstacle clockwise. This can be achieved by first moving horizontally to the right, clearing the x-coordinate of Obstacle 1, then moving upwards, and finally heading towards the goal.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Starting point
    (5.5, 1.75),  # Move right, clearing Obstacle 1's x-range 
    (5.5, 9.0),   # Move upwards, clearing Obstacle 1's y-range
    (9.0, 9.0)    # Move to the goal
]

]

[08/22/2024 08:40:50 AM] The original path attempts to move directly from the start to the goal, resulting in collisions with Obstacle 1. A safer approach involves navigating around Obstacle 1 completely.

1. **Starting Point:** We can use the original starting point (1.75, 1.75).
2. **Moving Upwards:**  Similar to the original path, we should move upwards to avoid the obstacle. We can aim for a point above the obstacle's top y-coordinate of 5.0. Let's go to (1.75, 6.0).
3. **Moving Rightwards:** Now, we can safely move to the right, clearing the obstacle. We can target a point with an x-coordinate greater than the obstacle's rightmost x-coordinate of 9.0. Let's go to (9.5, 6.0).
4. **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, we can move down to reach the goal set. We can end at (9.0, 9.0), which is within the goal set.

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),
    (1.75, 6.0), 
    (9.5, 6.0),

    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:41:25 AM] The issue with the previous path is that the segment connecting (0.9, 5.1) to (9.1, 5.1) directly cuts through Obstacle 1. 

To fix this, we can adjust the path to go around Obstacle 1. Since the obstacle forms a square shape from (1, 5) to (5, 9), we need to navigate outside this region. 

We can modify the path to first move downwards, then go around the obstacle to the right, and finally upwards to reach the goal.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),   # Start within the start set
    (1.75, 0.9),   # Move downwards to avoid the obstacle 
    (5.1, 0.9),   # Move rightwards, clear of the obstacle
    (9.1, 0.9),   # Continue rightwards 
    (9.0, 9.0)    # Move upwards to reach the goal set
]
```
