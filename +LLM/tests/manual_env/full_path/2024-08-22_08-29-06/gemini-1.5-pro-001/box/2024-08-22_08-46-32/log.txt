# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

]

[08/22/2024 08:46:36 AM] The obstacle forms a square shape that encloses the start set, leaving a narrow passage on the top side. The path needs to navigate through this passage to reach the goal set.

new_path = [
    (1.75, 2.0),   # Start within the start set, slightly shifted towards the opening
    (1.75, 5.5),   # Move upwards, clearing the obstacle with a margin

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:46:42 AM] The initial path goes straight up and intersects the obstacle. To avoid this, we need to navigate around the obstacle. 

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Start:** Begin at the top edge of the start set, for example at (1.75, 2.0) as in the initial attempt.
2. **Move Right:**  Move rightwards, clearing the x-coordinate of obstacle 1 (x=5.0). A safe waypoint could be (5.5, 2.0).
3. **Move Up:** Now safe to move upwards, surpassing the obstacle's y-coordinate (y=5.0), we can aim for (5.5, 5.5).
4. **Head to Goal:** Finally, move towards the goal set. A possible endpoint within the goal set is (9.0, 9.0).

Therefore, the adjusted path is: 

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 2.0), 
    (5.5, 2.0), 
    (5.5, 5.5),

]

[08/22/2024 08:46:49 AM] The primary obstacle is shaped like a rotated rectangle, creating a funnel-like path from the start to the goal. The initial path fails because it attempts to cross through the obstacle. To circumvent this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle. 

The safest approach is to skirt along the outer edges of the obstacle.  Therefore, we will guide the path around the obstacle by adding waypoints:

1. **Starting Point**: We'll keep the starting point within the start set: (1.75, 2.0)

2. **Navigating Around the Obstacle**: To avoid the obstacle, we'll introduce waypoints that move along its perimeter:
    - (1.75, 6.0):  Moves directly upwards, clearing the obstacle's top edge.
    - (9.5, 6.0):  Moves directly rightwards, keeping a safe distance from the obstacle.

3. **Reaching the Goal**: Finally, we move downwards to reach a point within the goal set: 
    - (9.0, 9.0): Remains within the goal set.

Therefore, the corrected path is:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 2.0), 
    (1.75, 6.0), 
    (9.5, 6.0), 
    (9.0, 9.0)

[08/22/2024 08:47:00 AM] The original path attempts to cross the obstacle directly. It needs adjustments to navigate around it.

1. **Starting Point:** (1.75, 2.0) is fine.
2. **Moving Upwards:** Instead of going straight up to (1.75, 6.0), we need to navigate around Obstacle 1. We can do this by moving to the right side of the obstacle. 
3. **Navigating to the Right:**  A safe waypoint would be (5.5, 2.0), clear of the obstacle's right edge.
4. **Moving Upwards:** From (5.5, 2.0), we can move upwards to (5.5, 6.0), safely above the obstacle.
5. **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, move horizontally to the goal set at (9.0, 9.0).

Here's the adjusted path:

[08/22/2024 08:47:10 AM] The original path attempts to pass directly through the obstacle. 
To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around the obstacle. 

The path can first move upwards, staying clear of the obstacle, then proceed rightwards towards the goal once it's at the same y-level as the top of the obstacle.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 2.0),  # Start within the start set
    (1.75, 6.0),  # Move upwards, clear of the obstacle

[08/22/2024 08:47:16 AM] The original path attempts to move directly upwards and then rightwards, intersecting with Obstacle 1.  We need a path that navigates around this obstacle.

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Start:** Begin at (1.75, 2.0), as before.
2. **Move Right:** Move rightwards, staying clear of Obstacle 1. A safe waypoint could be (6.0, 2.0), well past the obstacle's rightmost edge.
3. **Move Upwards:** From this point, we can safely move upwards towards the goal.  (6.0, 9.0) positions us directly below the goal set.
4. **Reach Goal:** Finally, move left to (9.0, 9.0) within the goal set.

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 2.0), 
    (6.0, 2.0),  
    (6.0, 9.0),

[08/22/2024 08:47:25 AM] The original path attempts to cross the obstacle directly. The obstacle spans from y-coordinate 1.0 to 9.0 between x-coordinates 1.0 and 9.0. 

To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around the obstacle. 

**Option 1: Go above:**

1.  **Start:** (1.75, 2.0) - Same as the original path.
2.  **Move above the obstacle:** (1.75, 9.5) - Maintain the x-coordinate and move to a y-coordinate above the obstacle.
3.  **Approach the goal:** (9.0, 9.5) - Move right towards the goal, staying above the obstacle.
4.  **End:** (9.0, 9.0) - Same as the original path.

1.  **Start:** (1.75, 2.0) - Same as the original path.
2.  **Move below the obstacle:** (1.75, 0.5) - Maintain the x-coordinate and move to a y-coordinate below the obstacle.
3.  **Approach the goal:** (9.0, 0.5) - Move right towards the goal, staying below the obstacle.

[08/22/2024 08:47:30 AM] The original path attempted to move vertically from the start set to the upper y-limit of the goal set, then horizontally to the goal set. This intersected with Obstacle 1.  

To avoid this, the path can first move horizontally to the right, clearing the x-limit of Obstacle 1, before moving vertically, and finally horizontally again to the goal. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 2.0),  # Start within the start set
    (6.0, 2.0),  # Move right, clearing Obstacle 1's x-range

]

[08/22/2024 08:47:35 AM] The current path attempts to go over and through the obstacle. A better approach would be to navigate around the obstacle completely. 

Here's a possible path:

1. **Start:** (1.75, 2.0) -  Same starting point as before, within the start set.
2. **Waypoint 1:** (1.75, 6.0) - Move directly upwards to clear the obstacle's highest y-coordinate.
3. **Waypoint 2:** (6.0, 6.0) - Move right, staying clear of the obstacle. 
4. **Waypoint 3:** (6.0, 9.0) - Move upwards, aligning with the goal set.
5. **End:** (9.0, 9.0) -  Move right, reaching the goal set.

**New Path:**

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:47:43 AM] The main issue with the initial path is that it tries to cross the obstacle directly. We need to find a way around it. 

1. **Analyzing the Obstacle:** The obstacle spans from x=1 to x=9 and from y=1 to y=9. This means our initial straight line approach won't work. 

2. **Identifying a Safe Passage:** We can go around the obstacle by navigating either above or below it. Since the goal is located in the top right corner, let's try going above.

3. **Adjusting the Waypoints:**
    * **Start:** Keep the starting point at (1.75, 2.0).
    * **Waypoint 1:** Move directly upwards to a point above the obstacle, for example (1.75, 10.0).
    * **Waypoint 2:** Move rightwards, staying above the obstacle, to align with the goal, for example (9.0, 10.0). 
    * **End:** Move downwards to a point within the goal set, for example (9.0, 9.0).

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 2.0),  
    (1.75, 10.0), 
    (9.0, 10.0),  
    (9.0, 9.0)   
]
```

This new path avoids the obstacle by navigating around it, ensuring a safe and collision-free trajectory to the goal.

[08/22/2024 08:48:23 AM] The initial path intersects with Obstacle 1 because it attempts to move directly upwards from the start set. To avoid this, the path needs to first navigate around the obstacle to the right before heading towards the goal.

Here's how the path can be adjusted:

1. **Starting Point:** (1.75, 2.0) - Same as the initial path.
2. **Navigate Right:** Move rightwards to a point clear of Obstacle 1. For example: (6.0, 2.0). This point is to the right of the obstacle's rightmost x-coordinate.
3. **Move Upwards:** Now safe to move upwards towards the goal: (6.0, 10.0). 
4. **Reach the Goal:** Finally, move left towards the goal set: (9.0, 9.0).

Therefore, the corrected path is:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 2.0), 
    (6.0, 2.0),
    (6.0, 10.0),

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:48:29 AM] The initial path goes through the obstacle. I need to find a way around it. 

1. **Starting Point:** I'll keep the starting point at (1.75, 2.0) since it's already within the start set.

2. **Navigating the Obstacle:** The obstacle spans from x=1 to x=9 and y=1 to y=9.  To avoid it completely, I'll need to route the path either above (y > 9) or below it (y < 1). Since the goal is located at the top right, it's more efficient to go above.

3. **Waypoint Above Obstacle:** I'll add a waypoint above the obstacle with an x-coordinate that allows for a straight shot to the goal. A good option would be (2.0, 10.0) as it's directly above the start point and provides a clear path. 

4. **Reaching the Goal:** From (2.0, 10.0), I can create a straight line to a point within the goal set, like (9.0, 9.0).

**Therefore, the corrected path is:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 2.0), 
    (2.0, 10.0), 
    (9.0, 9.0)
]

			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

]

[08/22/2024 08:48:36 AM] The original path crosses Obstacle 1 because it attempts to move directly upwards from the start set. To avoid this, we can route the path around the left side of the obstacle.

1. **Start:** We can keep the starting point of (1.75, 2.0).
2. **Navigate around Obstacle 1:** Move left to a point with an x-coordinate less than 1.0 (Obstacle 1's leftmost point) and a y-coordinate above 5.0 (Obstacle 1's topmost point). Let's choose (0.5, 5.5).
3. **Move towards the goal:** From (0.5, 5.5), we can move directly right towards the goal set without encountering obstacles. Let's choose (9.0, 5.5) as an intermediate waypoint.
4. **Reach the goal:** Finally, move down to a point within the goal set. Let's choose (9.0, 9.0).

Here's the updated path:

[08/22/2024 08:48:41 AM] The current path attempts to cross the obstacle horizontally. We need to adjust the path to go around it. 

1. **Start:** The starting point (1.75, 2.0) is fine.
2. **Above the Obstacle:** We need to navigate above the obstacle. Since the highest point of the obstacle is at y=9.0, let's aim for a waypoint with y=9.5 to ensure clearance.  We'll keep the x-coordinate low to avoid the obstacle, so (1.75, 9.5) is a good intermediate waypoint.
3. **Clear Path:** From (1.75, 9.5), we have a clear path to the goal. We can move directly to a point within the goal set.

[08/22/2024 08:48:46 AM] The initial path attempts to move directly upwards from the start set to the goal set. However, this movement is obstructed by Obstacle 1. To circumvent this, the path needs to navigate around the obstacle.

Given that Obstacle 1 is a quadrilateral spanning from x-coordinate 1.0 to 9.0 and y-coordinate 1.0 to 9.0,  the path can be adjusted by moving outside the x-coordinate range of the obstacle before moving upwards.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 2.0),  # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 2.0),  # Move outside the x-coordinate range of Obstacle 1 
    (0.5, 9.5),  # Move upwards to the level of the goal set
    (9.0, 9.0)   # Move rightwards to reach the goal set
]
```

This path first moves left, clearing the obstacle, then proceeds upwards, and finally rightwards to reach the goal. This avoids any intersection with Obstacle 1.
