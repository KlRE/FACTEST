# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:15:05 AM] The provided obstacles create a sort of channel that the path needs to navigate through. 

1. **Starting Point:** We can start at the top vertex of the start quadrilateral:  (-0.5, 0.87)

2. **Navigating the Channel:** We need to move upwards, avoiding Obstacle 2,  and then rightwards, staying within the channel created by the obstacles. 

3. **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, we can navigate towards the goal quadrilateral.

Here's a possible path:

```
new_path = [
    (-0.5, 0.87),    # Start at the top vertex of the start quadrilateral 
    (-0.5, 2.5),     # Move upwards to avoid Obstacle 2
    (1.5,  2.5),     # Move rightwards within the channel 
    (2.5, 2.5),     # Continue moving rightwards
    (3.46, 2.87)      # Reach the top left vertex of the goal quadrilateral
]
```

[08/22/2024 09:15:17 AM] The initial path crosses obstacle 2 multiple times. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle. 

1. **Starting Point:** I'll keep the starting point at (0.0, 0.0) as it's already within the start set.

2. **Navigating Obstacle 2:**  Obstacle 2 extends significantly in the positive x-direction. It also extends slightly below the starting point's y-coordinate. Therefore, the path needs to initially move significantly in the positive y-direction to clearly circumvent obstacle 2.

3. **Approaching the Goal:** Once clear of obstacle 2, the path can move towards the goal set. Given the goal set's location, a direct eastward movement is possible.

4. **Final Approach:**  Finally, the path can turn north and proceed to a suitable end point within the goal set.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0),   // Start
    (0.0, 4.0),   // Move up to avoid obstacle 2 
    (3.0, 4.0),   // Move right towards the goal

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:15:23 AM] The original path attempts to move directly from the start to the goal, crossing several obstacles in the process. We need to find a way around these obstacles.

1. **Navigating Obstacle 2:**  We can start by moving upwards from the start set to avoid the lower portion of Obstacle 2. 
2. **Navigating Obstacle 1:**  Obstacle 1 presents a more challenging barrier. It extends far in both the x and y directions.  We can navigate around it by first moving upwards, then rightwards to clear its top-right corner. 

Let's try this revised path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0),     // Start Point
    (0.0, 4.0),     // Move upwards to clear Obstacle 2
    (6.0, 4.0),     // Move rightwards, staying above Obstacle 1
    (6.0, 2.0),     // Move downwards, aiming for the goal set
    (3.46, 2.87)   // Final point inside the goal set
]
```

This path aims to avoid all obstacles by going around Obstacle 2, then above and around Obstacle 1 before approaching the goal set.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:15:31 AM] The original path attempts to navigate above Obstacle 1 and through a gap in Obstacle 2. However, this gap is too narrow and several segments intersect with the obstacles. 

To correct this, we can re-route the path to go below both obstacles:

1. **Start:** Keep the starting point at (0.0, 0.0).
2. **Navigate below Obstacle 1:** Move downwards to a y-coordinate below Obstacle 1, for example, (0.0, -1.0). 
3. **Move right, avoiding Obstacle 2:**  Move rightwards, ensuring to stay below the lowest point of Obstacle 2. A safe waypoint could be (2.0, -1.0).
4. **Navigate upwards towards the goal:**  From this point, move upwards to a point safely above the rightmost edge of Obstacle 2, for example (2.0, 3.0). 
5. **Reach the goal:** Finally, move rightwards to reach the goal set at (3.46, 2.87).

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0),
    (0.0, -1.0),

]

[08/22/2024 09:15:37 AM] The initial path was largely inefficient and had multiple intersections with obstacles. Let's break down a safer approach:

1. **Starting Point:** We can keep (0.0, 0.0) as our starting point as it lies well within the start set.

2. **Navigating Obstacles:**  
    - Obstacle 2 presents an immediate hurdle moving directly right or down from the start.  
    - Obstacle 1 extends far across the x-axis, making a solely horizontal approach difficult.
    - There is a noticeable gap between the lower edge of Obstacle 1 and the upper edge of Obstacle 2.

3. **Path Modification:**

    - From (0.0, 0.0), move significantly upwards to a y-value greater than the highest point of Obstacle 2, say (0.0, 4.0).
    - Proceed rightwards, staying clear of Obstacle 1, to a point roughly aligned with the goal set's x-coordinate, such as (3.5, 4.0).
    -  Finally, descend directly down into the goal set at (3.5, 2.87).

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0), 
    (0.0, 4.0), 
    (3.5, 4.0),

[08/22/2024 09:15:43 AM] The previous path attempted to go above the obstacles, but intersected with Obstacle 1 in multiple segments. A better strategy is to navigate below the obstacles.

Here's the updated path:

```

    (0.0, -1.0),   # Move downwards, clearing Obstacle 2

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:15:50 AM] The initial path attempts to go around obstacle 2 from the right side, but fails to stay clear of its boundaries. 
To correct this, the path should be adjusted to go around obstacle 2 from the left and utilize the space between obstacles 1 and 2:

1. **Starting Point:** (0.0, 0.0) - This point is within the start set.
2. **Waypoint 1:** (0.0, 4.0) - Move vertically upwards to avoid obstacle 2. 
3. **Waypoint 2:** (2.5, 4.0) - Move horizontally towards the gap between the obstacles.
4. **Waypoint 3:** (2.5, 6.5) - Move vertically upwards, clearing obstacle 1.
5. **Waypoint 4:** (4.0, 6.5) - Move horizontally, clearing obstacle 2.
6. **End Point:** (3.46, 2.5) - Move diagonally into the goal set.

This adjusted path ensures a safe distance from all obstacles while reaching the goal set. 

Here is the corrected path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0),
    (0.0, 4.0),
    (2.5, 4.0),
    (2.5, 6.5),

[08/22/2024 09:16:18 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate above obstacle 1 but fails due to several intersections. The key insight is to find a path that goes below obstacle 1 and obstacle 2.

Here's a possible path considering the obstacle positions:

1. **Start:** (0.0, 0.0) -  This starting point is within the start set.
2. **Navigate below Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2:** (0.0, -0.5) - Moving slightly downwards ensures clearance from both obstacles.
3. **Move towards the goal:** (6.0, -0.5) -  This moves the path clear of the obstacles and towards the goal position. 
4. **Reach the goal:** (3.46, 2.5) - This point lies within the goal set.

**New Path:**
```
new_path = [(0.0, 0.0), (0.0, -0.5), (6.0, -0.5), (3.46, 2.5)]

### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:16:29 AM] The initial path goes through the obstacles. 
It can be fixed by navigating around obstacle 1 on the left and obstacle 2 on the right.

1. **Start Point:**  We can start at the top-most point of the start set: (0.37, 1.37). 
2. **Avoiding Obstacle 1:** To go around obstacle 1, the path needs to move left and up. A waypoint can be added at (-1.0, 2.0) to clear obstacle 1.
3. **Avoiding Obstacle 2:** With obstacle 1 cleared, the path needs to head towards the goal while staying clear of obstacle 2. A waypoint at (1.0, 3.0) achieves this.
4. **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, the path can head straight to a point in the goal set, such as (3.46, 2.5).

**New Path:**

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:16:37 AM] The previous path goes out of the starting set and collides with Obstacle 1 multiple times. It also takes an inefficient route to the goal set. 

1. **Start Point:**  We need to begin within the start set. A good starting point would be (0.37, 1.37), which is already one of the vertices of the start quadrilateral.

2. **Navigating Obstacle 1:** Obstacle 1 presents a significant challenge as it occupies a large portion of the space between the start and goal. To circumvent it, we can first move to the right, staying below the lower-right vertex of the start quadrilateral. Let's add a waypoint at (1.5, 0.5). 

3. **Continuing to the Goal:** From (1.5, 0.5), we have a clear path to maneuver towards the goal set without intersecting any obstacles. We can add a waypoint at (2.5, 2.0) and then proceed directly to a point within the goal set. 

4. **End Point:** We can choose (3.46, 2.5), a vertex of the goal quadrilateral, as our endpoint.

Therefore, the revised path looks like this:

```
new_path = [
    (0.37, 1.37), 
    (1.5, 0.5),
    (2.5, 2.0),
    (3.46, 2.5)

[08/22/2024 09:16:44 AM] The previous path failed because it intersected with both obstacles. To correct this, we need to find a way around the obstacles to reach the goal. 

1. **Starting Point:** We can start at the top-right corner of the start set: (0.37, 1.37). This gives us a good starting position to navigate around the obstacles.

2. **Navigating Obstacle 2:**  Obstacle 2 presents a challenge as it spans a large portion of the y-axis.  We can navigate around it by first moving to the right, staying clear of its top-right vertex.  A good waypoint could be (1.5, 2.0). 

3. **Navigating Obstacle 1:** From (1.5, 2.0), we need to maneuver around Obstacle 1. We can do this by continuing to move right and slightly upward to a point like (2.5, 2.5). 

4. **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, we have a clear path to the goal. We can move to the left edge of the goal set at (2.96, 2.87).

[08/22/2024 09:16:55 AM] The previous path failed to adhere to both the start and end set constraints, and also intersected with an obstacle. The goal now is to construct a path that originates within the start set, successfully navigates around the obstacles, and finally terminates within the boundaries of the goal set.

Let's break down the environment:

1. **Start Set:** We need to begin at a point within the quadrilateral defined by [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]. A suitable starting point could be the centroid of this shape.

2. **Obstacles Analysis:**
   - **Obstacle 1**  [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]] spans across a large area.
   - **Obstacle 2** [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]] also presents a significant barrier. 

3. **Navigating the Obstacles:**  The key is to find a way around the obstacles.  A possible route could involve moving upwards initially, maneuvering around the top of Obstacle 1, and then proceeding towards the goal set.

4. **Goal Set:** Finally, we need to end up within the goal set defined by [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]].


**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.285, 0.75),   # Start within the start set (centroid)
    (0.285, 4.0),    # Move upwards to clear Obstacle 1
    (3.0, 4.0),      # Move rightwards towards the goal set
    (3.5, 3.0),      # Adjust position to enter the goal set safely
    (3.46, 2.5)     # End within the goal set 
]

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.

[08/22/2024 09:17:12 AM] The initial path was trying to take a too direct route to the goal and thus crossed Obstacle 1 multiple times. To correct this, we need to plan a path that goes around Obstacle 1. 

First, I'll move directly south to avoid an early collision with Obstacle 1.  Then, I'll navigate to the right, steering clear of the bottom corner of Obstacle 1. Finally, I'll proceed upward to reach the goal set.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.285, 0.75),  # Start point (unchanged)
    (0.285, 0.2),   # Move south to avoid early collision with Obstacle 1 
    (2.0, 0.2),    # Move east, staying clear of Obstacle 1

[08/22/2024 09:17:20 AM] The previous path attempts to navigate through a space crowded with obstacles. To find a successful path, let's break down the environment and strategically place waypoints.

1. **Starting Point:** We'll keep the starting point at (0.285, 0.75) within the start set.

2. **Navigating Obstacles:**
   - Obstacle 2 presents a significant barrier going right. We need to move above its highest y-coordinate (3.5) before moving towards the goal. 
   - Obstacle 1 extends far to the right, making a straight path to the goal impossible.

3. **Strategic Waypoints:**
   -  Let's first move above Obstacle 2 by going to (0.285, 3.7). 
   -  Then, we'll carefully navigate to the right. A safe point appears to be (1.5, 3.7), staying clear of Obstacle 1.
   -  From there, we can proceed right to (2.5, 3.7).
   -  Finally, descend to the goal set at (3.46, 2.5).

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.285, 0.75), 
    (0.285, 3.7), 
    (1.5, 3.7),

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:17:25 AM] The original path intersects with Obstacle 1 multiple times. To correct this, we need to find a way around it. 

- **Starting Point:**  (0.285, 0.75) is fine.
- **Maneuvering Around Obstacle 1:** The key is to navigate around the 'corner' of Obstacle 1 that juts out towards the start position. To do this, we can first move upwards to a y-coordinate higher than the obstacle's highest point, then proceed rightwards. Finally, we can adjust our course to reach the goal set.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.285, 0.75),   // Start point
    (0.285, 6.5),   // Move upwards, clearing Obstacle 1's height
    (3.5, 6.5),    // Move rightwards, staying clear of Obstacle 1
    (3.46, 2.5)     // Move downwards to the chosen end point within the goal set

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:17:34 AM] The original path attempts to navigate above Obstacle 1. However, both upward and downward segments collide with it. A better strategy is to navigate below Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2, as there is a clear path.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.285, 0.75),   # Start within the start set
    (0.285, -0.5),  # Move downwards to a point clearly below Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2
    (7.0, -0.5),   # Move rightwards to a point clear of Obstacle 2
    (7.0, 3.0),    # Move upwards to a point above Obstacle 2
    (3.46, 3.0)     # Move leftwards to the goal set, ensuring a clear path
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Initial Downward Movement:**  The path first moves downwards to  `(0.285, -0.5)`, ensuring it's below the lowest points of both Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2. 
2. **Rightward Movement:**  Next, it moves rightwards to `(7.0, -0.5)`. This segment is safe as it remains below all obstacles.
3. **Upward Movement:** The path then moves upwards to `(7.0, 3.0)`, reaching a point safely above Obstacle 2.
4. **Final Approach to Goal:**  Lastly, it moves leftwards to `(3.46, 3.0)`, a point within the goal set.

This adjusted path successfully avoids all obstacles and reaches the goal set.

[08/22/2024 09:17:40 AM] The initial path attempts to go around Obstacle 2 by staying close to its boundaries. However, this results in multiple intersections. 

It's clear that a more effective strategy is needed to navigate between the obstacles. Looking at their positioning, there's a noticeable gap between the upper-right corner of Obstacle 2 and the right edge of Obstacle 1.  

The corrected path will leverage this gap:

1. **Start:** (0.285, 0.75) - Remains within the start set.
2. **Navigate Right:** (2.5, 0.75) - Move horizontally to the right, staying clear of Obstacle 2's top-left corner.
3. **Ascend:** (2.5, 4.0) - Move vertically upwards, safely passing between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 1.
4. **Reach Goal:** (3.46, 3.0) - Move directly to a point within the goal set.

**New Path:**

[08/22/2024 09:17:50 AM] The initial path attempts to go through the obstacles. 
1. The first segment connecting (0.285, 0.75) and (2.5, 0.75) cuts through Obstacle 2. 
2. The second segment going straight up from (2.5, 0.75) to (2.5, 4.0) collides with both Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2. 
3. The final segment from (2.5, 4.0) to (3.46, 3.0) also intersects Obstacle 1.

To correct this, we need a path that navigates around the obstacles. Here's a possible approach:

1. **Start:** Keep the starting point at (0.285, 0.75).
2. **Navigate Upwards:** Move vertically upwards to a point above Obstacle 2. A suitable waypoint could be (0.285, 3.0). 
3. **Navigate Rightwards:** Move horizontally to the right, staying above both obstacles. A suitable waypoint could be (6.0, 3.0).
4. **Navigate Downwards:**  Move vertically downwards to align with the goal set. A suitable waypoint could be (6.0, 2.87).
5. **Reach the Goal:** Move horizontally to the left to enter the goal set and end at (3.46, 2.87).

Therefore, a corrected path could be:

```
new_path = [(0.285, 0.75), (0.285, 3.0), (6.0, 3.0), (6.0, 2.87), (3.46, 2.87)] 
```

This path avoids all obstacles and successfully reaches the goal set.

    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/22/2024 09:18:37 AM] The initial path failed because it attempted to cross both obstacles directly. To correct this, the path needs to navigate around the obstacles. 

1. **Starting Point:** Keep the starting point at (0.285, 0.75) as it's already within the start set.

2. **Navigating Obstacle 1:** 
    - Obstacle 1 stretches vertically and has a large x-range.  
    - Instead of moving directly up to y=3.0, guide the path around the left side of Obstacle 1.  
    - Add a waypoint to the left of Obstacle 1, for instance, at (-2.0, 0.75).
    - Then add another waypoint above Obstacle 1 to clear its top edge, for instance, at (-2.0, 7.0).

3. **Navigating Obstacle 2:**
    - From the point above Obstacle 1, the path needs to navigate around Obstacle 2. 
    - Obstacle 2 extends primarily to the right.
    - Add a waypoint to the right, giving enough clearance, for example, at (7.5, 7.0).

4. **Reaching the Goal Set:**
    - From (7.5, 7.0), the path has a clear line of sight to the goal set.
    - Add a waypoint within the goal set, for instance, at (3.46, 2.87).

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.285, 0.75), 
    (-2.0, 0.75),
    (-2.0, 7.0),
    (7.5, 7.0), 
    (3.46, 2.87)
]
```

This revised path successfully avoids both obstacles by navigating around them and reaches the goal set.
