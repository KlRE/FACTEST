]

[08/22/2024 08:57:33 AM] The initial path attempts to move vertically and then horizontally. However, obstacles 1 and 2 create a significant barrier. To navigate this, the path needs to maneuver around these obstacles. 

1. **Starting Point:** We can keep the starting point at (0.0, 0.0) as it sits within the start set.

2. **Navigating Obstacles:**
   -  Instead of moving directly upwards, the path needs to first navigate around the bottom left corner of Obstacle 2.  
   -  A waypoint could be placed at (1.0, -1.0) to achieve this. 
   -  From there, the path can move vertically upwards to clear Obstacle 2, say to point (1.0, 3.0).
   -  Next, the path needs to clear the top right corner of Obstacle 1. 
   -  Moving horizontally to the right to point (6.0, 3.0) would achieve this. 
   -  Finally, the path can move downwards towards the goal set.

3. **Reaching the Goal:** A final waypoint can be placed at (3.5, 2.5), which sits comfortably within the goal set.

Therefore, the adjusted path, considering the obstacle avoidance, would be:

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0),  
    (1.0, -1.0), 
    (1.0, 3.0),  
    (6.0, 3.0),  
    (3.5, 2.5)   
]

[08/22/2024 08:57:43 AM] The main issue with the initial path was that it went through the obstacles instead of navigating around them. To correct this, we need to visualize the obstacles and find a path that weaves around them.

1. **Starting Point:** The initial point (0.0, 0.0) is fine as it lies within the start set.

2. **Navigating Obstacles:**  
    * Obstacle 2 sits to the left and below the start set, extending towards the right. 
    * Obstacle 1 sits above and to the right of the start set. 
    * To avoid both, we need to initially head rightwards, giving a wide berth to Obstacle 2.

3. **Intermediate Waypoint:** Let's place a waypoint at (2.0, 0.5). This moves us safely to the right of the start set and below Obstacle 1.

4. **Approaching the Goal:** 
    * The goal set is located to the top right. 
    * We need to navigate above Obstacle 2 and then approach the goal from the right to avoid the top corner of Obstacle 1.

5. **Final Waypoints:** Let's add waypoints at (2.0, 4.0) and (4.0, 3.0).  This takes us above Obstacle 2, avoids the corner of Obstacle 1, and positions us for a clear path to the goal. 

6. **Endpoint:** We can then choose a point within the goal set, such as (3.46, 2.5), as our endpoint.


**New Path:**

Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:57:51 AM] The initial path attempts to take a more or less straight line to the goal, but as the feedback indicates, this results in multiple collisions with the obstacles.  A new approach is needed.

- **Starting Point:**  We can use the same starting point (0.0, 0.0) as it sits within the start set.

- **Navigating Obstacles:**  
    - Obstacle 2 presents a significant barrier as it stretches across a large portion of the x-axis.  To circumvent this, we need to direct the path above its highest y-value (3.5).
    - Obstacle 1 lies primarily in the positive x and y quadrant. 

- **Waypoint Strategy:**
    1. **Ascend above Obstacle 2:** Move vertically to a point above Obstacle 2. Let's choose (0.0, 4.0) 
    2. **Proceed Right, Avoiding Obstacle 1:**  Move rightward, staying clear of Obstacle 1's leftmost x-coordinate (-3.23). A safe waypoint could be ( -3.5, 4.0).
    3. **Approach the Goal:**  Now having a clear path, we can proceed towards the goal set. We can select a point within the goal set, like (3.46, 2.5)

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0),
    (0.0, 4.0),
    (-3.5, 4.0), 
    (3.46, 2.5)

[08/22/2024 08:58:20 AM] The initial path has collisions because it doesn't properly account for the obstacles' positions and shapes. 

**Analysis:**

* **Segment 1:** The line from (0.0, 0.0) to (0.0, 4.0) directly cuts through both obstacles. We need to find a way around them. 
* **Segment 3:** Similarly, the line from (-3.5, 4.0) to (3.46, 2.5) also intersects obstacle 1.

**Strategy:**

1. **Navigate Above Obstacles:**  Since the obstacles are concentrated in the lower part of the space, let's try going above them.  
2. **Clearance:**  We need to ensure our path maintains a safe distance to avoid collisions.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0),    # Start inside the start set
    (0.0, 7.0),    # Move vertically upwards to a point clearly above all obstacles
    (8.0, 7.0),    # Move horizontally to a point directly above the goal set
    (3.46, 2.5)     # Move down into the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

* We've added waypoints to create a path that goes vertically up, then horizontally right, and finally vertically down into the goal. 
* This path avoids both obstacles with a significant margin.

**Note:** The coordinates (8.0, 7.0) were chosen to be sufficiently far to the right and above the obstacles. You can adjust these values based on the specific clearance requirements and a more detailed analysis of the obstacle geometry.

[08/22/2024 08:58:26 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate around the obstacles by going vertically then horizontally. However, this leads to collisions. 
To avoid this, the path needs to maneuver through the space between the obstacles more carefully.

1. **Start:** (0.0, 0.0) is a valid starting point within the start set.

2. **Navigate Upwards:**  Instead of going straight up which intersects Obstacle 2, we need to navigate between the "corridor" created by the two obstacles.  A good waypoint would be around (0.5, 2.0) as it sits between the obstacles.

3. **Navigate Rightwards:** From (0.5, 2.0) we can move rightwards towards the goal. A safe waypoint is around (2.5, 2.0), staying clear of Obstacle 1's top-left vertex.

4. **Reach the Goal:** Finally, from (2.5, 2.0), a straight path to (3.46, 2.5) within the goal set is clear.

**Therefore, a corrected path is:**

```
new_path = [(0.0, 0.0), (0.5, 2.0), (2.5, 2.0), (3.46, 2.5)]

]

[08/22/2024 08:58:33 AM] The initial path goes through Obstacles 1 and 2. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around these obstacles. 

1. **Starting Point:** Keep the starting point at (0.0, 0.0), which is inside the start set.

2. **Navigating Obstacles:**  
    - Obstacle 2 extends significantly lower than Obstacle 1. Therefore, it's more efficient to route the path above both obstacles. 
    - Move upward, staying clear of Obstacle 2's rightmost vertex at (7.06, 1.77). A safe waypoint could be (0.0, 2.0).
    - Move rightward, staying above Obstacle 1. A safe waypoint could be (2.5, 2.0). 

3. **Reaching the Goal:**
    - Continue moving rightward towards the goal set. 
    - The final waypoint can remain at (3.46, 2.5), which is inside the goal set.

**New Path:**

```

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

    
## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.0, 0.0), (0.0, 2.0), (2.5, 2.0), (3.46, 2.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    Obstacle Avoidance (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
		Segment 1 between points (0.0, 0.0) and (0.0, 2.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]
		Segment 2 between points (0.0, 2.0) and (2.5, 2.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:58:40 AM] The initial path goes through obstacles 1 and 2. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around these obstacles. 

1. **Start Point:** We can keep the start point at (0.0, 0.0) as it is within the start set.

2. **Navigating Obstacles:**  
    - We need to move above Obstacle 2, which has a maximum y-coordinate of approximately 3.5.  Let's aim for a y-value of 4.0 to be safe.
    - To avoid Obstacle 1, which extends to the right, we should move vertically upwards first before moving horizontally towards the goal.

3. **Approaching the Goal:**
    - Once we are above Obstacle 2, we can move horizontally towards the goal position. 
    - Since the goal set starts at x = 2.96, we can aim for a waypoint at x = 2.8 to be safe.

4. **Reaching the Goal:** 
    -  Finally, we can move down to a point within the goal set. The point (3.46, 2.5) is a good choice as it lies within the goal set.

Therefore, a revised path could be:

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0),    # Start Point
    (0.0, 4.0),    # Move above Obstacle 2
    (2.8, 4.0),    # Move horizontally towards the goal
    (3.46, 2.5)   # Reach the goal set
]
```

]

[08/22/2024 08:58:45 AM] The initial path was attempting to take too straight of a line to the goal, resulting in collisions with Obstacle 1.  To avoid this, we can route the path around the obstacles.

Starting at (0, 0), we can first move to a point above Obstacle 2. A good waypoint for this is (0, 3.6). 

Next, we need to navigate around the top of Obstacle 1. A waypoint at (2.0, 3.6) keeps us clear. 

Finally, we can head towards the goal, aiming for a point near the center at (3.46, 2.5).

Therefore, a corrected path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0), 
    (0.0, 3.6),
    (2.0, 3.6),

]

[08/22/2024 08:58:52 AM] The initial path attempted to take a direct route towards the goal. However, Obstacle 1 presents a significant barrier. To navigate this, the path needs to be adjusted:

1. **Starting Point:**  We'll keep the starting point at (0.0, 0.0) as it's within the start set.

2. **Navigating Around Obstacle 1:**  Obstacle 1 stretches across a large portion of the y-axis. To avoid it, we need to move above its highest point (y = 6.1).  

3. **Approaching the Goal:** With Obstacle 1 cleared, we can plot a more direct route towards the goal set. 

4. **Final Approach:** A final adjustment might be needed to ensure the path enters the goal set without intersecting any part of Obstacle 1. 

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0),        // Start Point
    (0.0, 6.5),        // Move above Obstacle 1 
    (3.0, 6.5),        // Move towards the goal set
    (3.46, 2.5)         // End point within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

*   The path now first navigates vertically to bypass the most challenging obstacle. 
*   Waypoints have been carefully chosen to ensure a safe distance from all obstacle boundaries.

This new path should successfully navigate the robot from the start to the goal while adhering to the non-crossing constraint.

[08/22/2024 08:59:23 AM] The initial path goes straight up from the start, hitting obstacles 1 and 2. To avoid this, the path should initially move to the right, taking advantage of the space between obstacles 1 and 2. Once past these obstacles, the path can safely proceed upwards and then turn left towards the goal. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0),   # Start at the bottom left corner of the start set
    (2.0, 0.0),   # Move right, staying clear of obstacle 2
    (2.0, 5.0),   # Move upwards, clearing obstacle 1
    (3.0, 5.0),   # Move right, preparing to navigate around the top of obstacle 1

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.

[08/22/2024 08:59:30 AM] The original path attempts to navigate directly to the goal region but encounters multiple obstacles. I will adjust the path to go around obstacles.

1. **Starting Point:** Keep the starting point at (0.0, 0.0) as it's already within the start set.

2. **Avoiding Obstacle 2:** Instead of moving directly right, let's first move upwards to avoid Obstacle 2 entirely.  A good waypoint could be (0.0, 2.0).

3. **Navigating between Obstacles:** Now we need to move right, passing between the top of Obstacle 2 and the bottom of Obstacle 1. We need to find a y-coordinate that's clear. Analyzing the obstacle coordinates, we can aim for a point like (2.5, 2.0), which should be safely between the obstacles.

4. **Approaching the Goal:**  From (2.5, 2.0), we can move directly into the goal set. A suitable endpoint would be (3.46, 2.5), which is inside the goal set.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0),  
    (0.0, 2.0), 
    (2.5, 2.0),

]

[08/22/2024 08:59:37 AM] The initial path attempts to move directly upwards and then right towards the goal.  However, this causes collisions with both obstacles. 

**Analysis:**

* **Obstacle 1:**  This obstacle stretches across a significant portion of the x-axis, making a direct path from the start to the right impossible.
* **Obstacle 2:** This obstacle sits above the start and extends downwards towards the goal, making a direct upward movement initially problematic.

**Strategy:**

1. **Navigate around Obstacle 2:** Instead of moving directly upwards, we need to first move right, avoiding Obstacle 2, and then proceed upwards.
2. **Clear Obstacle 1:** Once above Obstacle 2, we can safely move right, clearing Obstacle 1. 
3. **Approach the Goal:** Finally, we can adjust our trajectory downwards to enter the goal set.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0),    # Start Point
    (1.5, 0.0),    # Move right, staying clear of Obstacle 2

    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:59:46 AM] The initial path attempts to take a rather direct route to the goal, but unfortunately intersects with both obstacles. 

Let's break down a safer approach:

1. **Starting Point:** We can keep the starting point at (0.0, 0.0) as it sits comfortably within the start set.

2. **Navigating Obstacle 2:** Obstacle 2 presents an immediate challenge as it stretches across both positive and negative y-axis. To avoid it, we need to navigate around its top end. 

3. **Reaching Positive Y:**  A safe bet would be to first move upwards to a y-coordinate greater than the highest point of Obstacle 2 (y = 3.5). Let's aim for (0.0, 4.0) to be safe.

4. **Moving Towards the Goal:** Now clear of Obstacle 2, we can start moving towards the goal. However, Obstacle 1 lies in wait. We need to pass through the space between its bottom left corner and Obstacle 2's top right corner.

5. **A Safe Passage:**  We can move directly rightwards to a point with an x-coordinate greater than Obstacle 1's rightmost edge (x=5.56).  Let's target (6.0, 4.0). 

6. **Final Approach:** Now clear of both obstacles, we can simply move down towards any point within the goal set. (3.46, 2.5) works nicely.

**Therefore, the revised path is:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0),   
    (0.0, 4.0),   
    (6.0, 4.0),

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:59:51 AM] The initial path attempts to go above obstacle 1 and 2, but intersects both.  Therefore, we need to find a path that goes below those obstacles.
1. **Starting Point:** We can keep the starting point at (0.0, 0.0) as it is inside the start set.
2. **Navigating Obstacles:** To go below obstacle 1 and 2, we need to navigate to the bottom left of both obstacles. A potential waypoint could be (-2.0, -1.0). 
3. **Reaching the Goal:** From (-2.0, -1.0), we can plot a straight course to the goal position without intersecting any obstacles. Let's choose (3.46, 2.5) as our endpoint within the goal set.

**Therefore, a revised path could be:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0), 
    (-2.0, -1.0), 
    (3.46, 2.5)

[08/22/2024 08:59:57 AM] The initial path crosses obstacle 2 because it takes a straight line from inside the start set to the goal set. To fix this, the path needs to first navigate around obstacle 2 before heading towards the goal.

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Start Point:** (0.0, 0.0) - This is a valid point within the start set.
2. **Waypoint 1:** (-2.0, 1.0) - This waypoint moves further away from obstacle 2 by going left and slightly up.
3. **Waypoint 2:** (1.0, 2.0) - This waypoint maneuvers around the top-right corner of obstacle 2. 
4. **End Point:** (3.46, 2.5) - This remains unchanged, as it is a valid point within the goal set.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0),
    (-2.0, 1.0),
    (1.0, 2.0),

[08/22/2024 09:00:23 AM] The initial path attempts to take a direct route but fails to avoid the obstacles. I'll adjust the path to navigate around the obstacles strategically:

1. **Starting Point:** I'll keep the starting point at (0.0, 0.0) as it's already within the start set.

2. **Navigating Obstacle 2:** To avoid Obstacle 2, the path needs to initially move to the right. A waypoint at (1.0, 0.0) allows for a safe eastward movement. 

3. **Navigating Obstacle 1:** From (1.0, 0.0), we need to circumvent Obstacle 1. Moving directly upwards to a point like (1.0, 3.0) and then rightwards to (3.0, 3.0) would create a safe passage between the top of Obstacle 2 and the left side of Obstacle 1.

4. **Reaching the Goal:** From (3.0, 3.0), the path can proceed directly to the goal set. I'll choose (3.46, 2.5) as the endpoint, which is inside the goal set. 

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [(0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 0.0), (1.0, 3.0), (3.0, 3.0), (3.46, 2.5)]

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:00:33 AM] The original path crosses both obstacles. To avoid this, we need to find a way around them. 

1. **Starting Point:** We can keep the starting point (0.0, 0.0) as it sits within the start set.

2. **Navigating Obstacle 2:** Obstacle 2 extends far to the right, making it difficult to go around it horizontally at a low y-coordinate. Therefore, we need to move upwards before we move towards the goal set. A good point to aim for is above the top-left corner of Obstacle 2, which is at approximately ( -1.73, -1.0). To provide a safe margin, let's aim for the point (0.0, 1.0).

3. **Navigating Obstacle 1:** Now we need to get around Obstacle 1. Obstacle 1's top-right corner is at (5.56, 4.37). We can safely move to the right above Obstacle 1 by aiming for a point with a y-coordinate greater than 4.37. Let's choose the point (2.0, 4.5), providing a safe distance. 

4. **Reaching the Goal Set:**  From (2.0, 4.5), we have a clear path to the goal set.  We can choose the goal point within the goal set as (3.46, 2.5), as in the original path. 

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [

[08/22/2024 09:00:41 AM] The initial path crosses obstacles in several places.  We need to navigate around Obstacle 1, which sits between the start and goal.

1. **Starting Point:** Keep the starting point at (0.0, 0.0) as it sits within the start set.

2. **Navigating Obstacle 1:** 
    * Obstacle 1 extends upwards significantly. Instead of going above it, let's try going below it.
    * We can move down and to the right to stay clear. A waypoint around (1.0, -1.0) could work.

3. **Approaching the Goal:**
    * From (1.0, -1.0), we have a clear path to move rightwards towards the goal set.
    * A waypoint around (3.0, -1.0) positions us directly below the goal.

4. **Reaching the Goal:** 
    * Move upwards from (3.0, -1.0) to enter the goal set.
    * (3.46, 2.5) is a valid endpoint within the goal set.

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/22/2024 09:00:52 AM] The initial path goes directly upwards, intersecting both obstacles.  We need to reroute it to go around the obstacles completely. 

Moving to the right and going around all the obstacles seems like the best strategy in this case. We can start at the rightmost point of the start quadrilateral, move far right to avoid all obstacles, then move up to be level with the goal, and finally go left towards the goal.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.87, 0.5),    # Start at the rightmost point of the start set
    (7.0, 0.5),    # Move far right, avoiding all obstacles
    (7.0, 3.0),    # Move upwards to be level with the goal quadrilateral
    (3.46, 3.0)     # Move leftwards to reach the goal set 
]
```
