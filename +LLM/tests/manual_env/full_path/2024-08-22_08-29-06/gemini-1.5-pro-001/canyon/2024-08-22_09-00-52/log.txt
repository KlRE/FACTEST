# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

[08/22/2024 09:01:09 AM] The initial path goes directly through obstacles. I will adjust the path to circumvent them.

1. **Start:** (0.0, 0.0) is a valid starting point within the start set.
2. **Avoiding Obstacle 2:** Obstacle 2 spans the lower portion of the environment.  To avoid it, I'll guide the path above it. A waypoint at (0.0, 1.5) will achieve this.
3. **Navigating between Obstacles:** Obstacle 1 presents a challenge as it occupies the space directly to the right of Obstacle 2. I'll route the path further to the right, then upwards to clear Obstacle 1. Waypoints at (2.0, 1.5) and (2.0, 3.0) will achieve this.
4. **Reaching the Goal:** From (2.0, 3.0), the path has a clear shot to the goal set. I'll choose (3.46, 2.87) as the endpoint, which is within the goal set.

**New Path:**
```

2. **Above Obstacle 1:** (0.0, 6.5) - This point is directly above Obstacle 1 and provides a clear path forward. 
3. **Towards Goal:** (3.0, 6.5) -  Move horizontally towards the goal, staying above Obstacle 1.
4. **Descend to Goal:** (3.0, 2.87) -  Safely descend to the level of the goal set.
5. **Goal:** (3.46, 2.87) - This point is within the goal set.

    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:01:23 AM] The original path attempts to navigate around the obstacles in a vertical manner but encounters intersections.  To rectify this:

1. **Starting Point:** I'll keep the starting point at (0.0, 0.87) within the start set.

2. **Navigating Obstacle 1:** To avoid Obstacle 1, a  shift to the right is needed before moving upwards. A suitable waypoint could be around (1.0, 0.87). From there, moving upwards to a point clear of Obstacle 1, like (1.0, 6.5), would be safe. 

3. **Approaching the Goal:** With Obstacle 1 cleared,  moving horizontally towards the goal is possible. A waypoint at (3.0, 6.5) positions the path for the final descent.

4. **Reaching the Goal:**  A final waypoint at (3.0, 2.87) allows for a direct path to the chosen endpoint within the goal set, (3.46, 2.87).

Therefore, the adjusted path is as follows:

```
new_path = [(0.0, 0.87), (1.0, 0.87), (1.0, 6.5), (3.0, 6.5), (3.0, 2.87), (3.46, 2.87)]

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:01:29 AM] The feedback indicates that the path goes through Obstacle 1. 
To fix this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle. 

Since the obstacle extends further to the left than the start set, the path needs to initially move to the right. 
Also, because the obstacle extends quite far upwards, it's necessary for the path to move significantly to the right to completely clear the obstacle before moving upwards. 

Once clear of Obstacle 1, the path can proceed upwards to a point that has a clear path to the goal set.
Then, it can move leftwards towards the goal set.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.87),   # Starting point within the start set
    (2.0, 0.87),   # Move rightwards, ensuring clear distance from Obstacle 1
    (2.0, 6.5),   # Move upwards, well clear of Obstacle 1
    (3.0, 6.5),   # Move rightwards, towards the goal set
    (3.0, 2.87),   # Move downwards to align with the goal set
    (3.46, 2.87)  # Move slightly rightwards to end within the goal set

[08/22/2024 09:01:35 AM] The initial path went through several obstacles. To fix this, the path needs to navigate around obstacle 1 and 2. A viable path can be achieved by going above both obstacles. 

First, the path should start from within the start set, for instance, at point (0.0, 0.87). From there, it can move vertically upwards to a point above the obstacles, such as (0.0, 7.0). This avoids crossing obstacle 2. 

Next, the path can move horizontally to the right, aiming for a point above the goal set and clear of obstacle 1. A suitable point could be (3.5, 7.0).

Finally, from this position, the path can descend vertically downwards directly into the goal set, ending at a point within the set, such as (3.5, 2.87).

Here is the updated path:

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:01:48 AM] The original path attempts to navigate around Obstacle 1 by going above it. However, segments of the path intersect with Obstacle 1. The path needs to be adjusted to go around the other side of Obstacle 1. 

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Start Point:** Keep the same starting point (0.0, 0.87).
2. **Navigate Below Obstacle 1:** Instead of going above, guide the path below Obstacle 1.  A waypoint around (1.0, -0.5) could work.
3. **Clear Obstacle 1:** Continue moving rightwards to a point that's clear of Obstacle 1, such as (6.0, -0.5).
4. **Approach Goal:** Move upwards towards the goal set. A waypoint like (6.0, 3.0) would work.
5. **End Point:** Finally, move leftwards to end inside the goal set at (3.46, 2.87).

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.87), 
    (1.0, -0.5), 
    (6.0, -0.5), 
    (6.0, 3.0), 
    (3.46, 2.87)
]
``` 
 
This new path avoids crossing Obstacle 1 by going around it and ensures all segments are clear of any obstacles.

[08/22/2024 09:02:22 AM] The main issue with the previous path was that it tried to go under obstacle 2, which turned out to be too tight of a space.  The updated path will instead go above obstacle 2.

Here's the thought process for the adjusted path:

1. **Start Point:** Keep the starting point at (0.0, 0.87) within the start set.
2. **Navigate Above Obstacle 2:**  To avoid obstacle 2 entirely, the path needs to go above its highest point (y=3.5).  A safe waypoint above obstacle 2 could be around (0.0, 4.0).
3. **Clear Obstacle 1:** Obstacle 1's rightmost point is at x=5.56.  To maintain a safe distance, the path should aim for an x-coordinate greater than that before changing direction to head towards the goal.  A waypoint like (6.0, 4.0) achieves this.
4. **Approach Goal:** With obstacles cleared, the path can move towards the goal. The final waypoint can be directly within the goal set, such as (3.46, 2.87).

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [(0.0, 0.87), (0.0, 4.0), (6.0, 4.0), (3.46, 2.87)]
```

Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:02:35 AM] The original path attempts to navigate above Obstacle 1, but the chosen waypoints result in collisions. A more effective approach would be to go below Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2 since they both have a relatively low y-coordinate. By going below, we can then safely navigate to the right and upwards towards the goal set.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0),  # Start at the bottom of the start set
    (0.0, -1.0),  # Move down to clear the obstacles
    (7.0, -1.0),  # Move right, staying clear of the obstacles
    (7.0, 3.0),  # Move upwards to be level with the goal set
    (3.46, 2.87)   # Move to the goal position 
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(0.0, 0.0):** We start at a point within the start set with a low y-coordinate to prepare for moving below the obstacles.
2. **(0.0, -1.0):**  Move directly downwards to a point safely below both obstacles.
3. **(7.0, -1.0):** Move rightward, staying at the same y-coordinate, passing safely below both obstacles.
4. **(7.0, 3.0):**  Move upwards to align with the height of the goal set.
5. **(3.46, 2.87):**  Finally, move left and slightly down to reach the chosen end point within the goal set.

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:02:42 AM] The original path attempts to go around the obstacles by sticking close to the edges of the environment. However, this leads to multiple intersections with Obstacle 2, which spans a large portion of the space. 

To avoid this, the path needs to navigate through the opening between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2.  

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0),   # Start within the start set
    (0.0, 2.0),   # Move upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 2 
    (2.0, 2.0),   # Move rightwards, staying below Obstacle 1
    (4.0, 2.0),   # Continue rightwards, entering the space between Obstacle 1 and 2 
    (4.0, 2.5),   # Move slightly upwards to reach the goal set
    (3.46, 2.87)  # End within the goal set
]
```

This path first moves upwards to avoid the lower portion of Obstacle 2. Then it proceeds rightwards, carefully staying below Obstacle 1 and entering the channel between the obstacles. Finally, it moves slightly upwards again to reach the goal set. This strategy ensures the path stays clear of all obstacles.

]

[08/22/2024 09:02:52 AM] The original path attempts to move directly to the right and then up to the goal.  However, there are obstacles blocking this direct path. To circumvent this, the path needs to navigate around the obstacles. 

1. **Starting Point:** We can keep the starting point at (0.0, 0.0) as it is within the start set.

2. **Navigating Obstacles:** We need to maneuver around the obstacles. Obstacle 1 occupies a space from approximately x = -3 to 6 and y = -0.13 to 6.1. Obstacle 2 poses a challenge as it extends across a significant portion of the x-axis. 

3. **Finding a Safe Passage:**  The key is to identify a region with a higher y-value that's clear of both obstacles. Examining the obstacle coordinates, there's a clear path above Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2.

4. **Adjusting the Path:**

    * From (0.0, 0.0), move vertically upwards to a point above the obstacles. A safe y-value could be 6.5 (ensuring we are comfortably clear of Obstacle 1's maximum y). So the next waypoint becomes (0.0, 6.5).

    * Now, we can safely move horizontally to the right, towards our goal.  A safe x-value could be 3.0, putting us close to the goal set's x-coordinate. So, the next waypoint becomes (3.0, 6.5).

    *  Finally, move downwards to enter the goal set. We can select (3.46, 2.87) as it sits comfortably within the goal set.

Therefore, the updated path is as follows:

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0),
    (0.0, 6.5),
    (3.0, 6.5),

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:02:57 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate above Obstacle 1 and towards the goal. However, it intersects with both Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2. To correct this:

1. **Navigate between Obstacles:**  There's a clear path between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2 if we stay below the y-coordinate 1. 
2. **Approach from the Right:** Instead of approaching the goal set from above, we can approach it from the right side to avoid crossing Obstacle 1. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0),    # Start within the start set

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.

[08/22/2024 09:03:17 AM] The proposed path goes right through obstacle 2.  I will adjust it to go around the obstacle.

1. **Starting Point:** I'll keep the starting point at (0.0, 0.0) as it's inside the start set.

2. **Navigating Obstacles:** To avoid Obstacle 2, the path needs to go "south" of it.  A waypoint below the minimum y-coordinate of Obstacle 2 will ensure this.  Let's place a waypoint at (0.0, -2.0).

3. **Reaching the Goal:** From (0.0, -2.0), the path can move east towards the goal set without encountering obstacles. Let's add a waypoint at (3.0, -2.0), and then directly to a point in the goal set (3.46, 2.87).

Therefore, the updated path is:

```
new_path = [(0.0, 0.0), (0.0, -2.0), (3.0, -2.0), (3.46, 2.87)]
```

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:03:25 AM] The original path attempts to go below the obstacles but fails. It seems more efficient to navigate above Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2 to reach the goal.

1.  **Start Point:** We can start at `(0.0, 0.0)` which is inside the start set. 
2.  **Navigate Upwards:** Move vertically upwards to a point `(0.0, y)` where `y` is greater than the highest point of Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2. Looking at the coordinates of Obstacle 1 and 2, a `y` value of 7.0 should suffice. This brings us to the point `(0.0, 7.0)`.
3.  **Navigate Rightwards:** Move horizontally rightwards towards the goal set to a point `(x, 7.0)`  where `x` is greater than the rightmost point of Obstacle 1. Choosing an `x` value of 6.0 should be sufficient. This leads to the waypoint `(6.0, 7.0)`.
4.  **Navigate Downwards:** Finally, move downwards to a point within the goal set, for instance, `(3.46, 2.87)`.

Therefore, the adjusted path avoiding all obstacles is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0), 
    (0.0, 7.0), 
    (6.0, 7.0), 
    (3.46, 2.87)
]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:03:32 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate above the obstacles. However, both upward and rightward segments intersect with obstacles. A more suitable approach involves navigating between Obstacles 1 and 2.

1. **Start:**  Begin at the origin (0.0, 0.0), which lies within the start set.
2. **Navigate Downwards:** To avoid collision with Obstacle 2, move downwards to a point below its lowest y-coordinate. A safe waypoint could be (0.0, -1.5).
3. **Navigate Rightwards:** Proceed rightwards, staying below Obstacle 1. A safe passage exists between Obstacles 1 and 2. A suitable waypoint could be (6.0, -1.5).
4. **Navigate Upwards:**  Move upwards towards the goal set, ensuring clearance from Obstacle 1. A waypoint like (6.0, 3.0) achieves this.
5. **Reach the Goal:** Finally, move leftwards to enter the goal set. The point (3.46, 2.87) serves as a valid endpoint.

Therefore, a revised path is:

```
new_path = [(0.0, 0.0), (0.0, -1.5), (6.0, -1.5), (6.0, 3.0), (3.46, 2.87)]

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:03:41 AM] The initial path attempts to go around Obstacle 2 by staying below it. However, this strategy fails because the obstacle stretches too far both horizontally and vertically. To correct the path, we should route it above Obstacle 2.

Here's a breakdown of the adjustments and the reasoning behind them:

1. **Starting Point:** We can keep the starting point at (0.0, 0.0) as it lies within the start set.

2. **Navigating Above Obstacle 2:**  
    - We need to move above the highest point of Obstacle 2, which has a y-coordinate of 3.5. Let's aim for a y-coordinate of 4.0 to provide a safe margin.
    - To avoid a vertical line that might touch the obstacle, we'll first move horizontally to the right. A suitable waypoint could be (1.0, 0.0).
    - Then, we can move vertically to (1.0, 4.0).

3. **Reaching the Goal Set:**
    - From (1.0, 4.0), we can move horizontally towards the goal set. A safe waypoint could be (3.0, 4.0), which provides a clear path to the goal.
    - Finally, we can choose a point within the goal set as the final waypoint, for instance, (3.46, 2.87).

Therefore, the adjusted path is as follows:

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0), 
    (1.0, 0.0), 
    (1.0, 4.0), 
    (3.0, 4.0), 
    (3.46, 2.87)
]
```

This path successfully avoids all obstacles while adhering to the start and end set requirements.

]

[08/22/2024 09:03:48 AM] The initial path attempts to go over Obstacle 2 and through Obstacle 1, which is not possible. To address this, we need to find a way around the obstacles. 

Starting from within the start set, we can move above Obstacle 2 by aiming for a point with a y-coordinate greater than 3.5 (Obstacle 2's maximum y-coordinate).  

Next, we need to navigate around Obstacle 1.  Since Obstacle 1's minimum x-coordinate is -3.23 and maximum x-coordinate is 5.56, we can move to the right while staying clear of Obstacle 1.  To do so, we can aim for a point with an x-coordinate greater than 5.56. Let's choose a point with an x-coordinate of 6 and a y-coordinate greater than 3.5 to avoid Obstacle 2.

From there, we can safely move towards the goal set.

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0),  # Start point
    (0.0, 4.0),  # Move above Obstacle 2 
    (6.0, 4.0),  # Move to the right, clear of Obstacle 1

[08/22/2024 09:03:53 AM] The initial path goes directly up and right, intersecting both obstacles. A safer approach is to navigate around the obstacles completely. 

Starting at the origin (0,0) still works. First, we should move to positive x values to avoid Obstacle 2 entirely. Then, we can move up to clear Obstacle 1, and finally head towards the goal.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0),    # Start at the origin
    (2.0, 0.0),    # Move right, staying clear of Obstacle 2 
    (2.0, 3.0),    # Move upwards, clearing Obstacle 1 
    (3.46, 2.87)   # Head towards the goal point within the goal set 
]
```

This path avoids both obstacles by navigating around them, first moving right then upwards. It ensures all segments are clear of intersections and provides a safe trajectory.

[08/22/2024 09:04:17 AM] The original path crosses obstacle 2 to get to the right side of the environment, and then collides with obstacle 1 on its way to the goal. The path needs to be adjusted to navigate around these obstacles more effectively. 

First, to avoid crossing obstacle 2 at the beginning, the path can initially move upwards within the start set. Then, to avoid obstacle 1, the path needs to move to the right in the space between the two obstacles. Once past obstacle 1, the path can proceed towards the goal set.

Here is a possible path based on these adjustments:

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0),   # Start within the start set
    (0.0, 4.0),   # Move upwards to avoid obstacle 2
    (2.5, 4.0),   # Move rightwards, staying above obstacle 1
    (2.5, 2.5),   # Move downwards to approach the goal set
    (3.46, 2.87)  # End within the goal set
]
```
