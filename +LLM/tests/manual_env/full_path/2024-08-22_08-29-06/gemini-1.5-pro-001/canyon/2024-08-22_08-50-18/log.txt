        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:50:26 AM] The provided obstacles create a channel-like path from the start to the goal positions.  Here's a possible path considering obstacle avoidance:

1. **Start:** Choose a point within the start quadrilateral, for instance: (0.1, 0.2) 
2. **Navigate Upwards:**  Move upwards avoiding Obstacle 2,  a possible waypoint could be: (0.1, 2.0)
3. **Navigate Rightwards:** Move rightwards towards the goal, staying within the channel formed by the obstacles. Waypoints could include: (1.5, 2.0), (2.5, 2.3)
4. **Reach the Goal:** Finally, move into the goal quadrilateral.  A possible endpoint within the goal set could be: (3.2, 2.6)

Therefore, the path could be represented by the following waypoints:

```
new_path = [
    (0.1, 0.2),   
    (0.1, 2.0),   
    (1.5, 2.0), 
    (2.5, 2.3),   
    (3.2, 2.6)    
]
``` 

**Important:** Remember to visually verify that this path avoids intersecting the obstacles based on their provided coordinates. This description provides a general strategy, and the exact waypoint values might need adjustments to ensure a safe distance from the obstacle boundaries.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:50:32 AM] The initial path attempts to move vertically from the start set, leading to collisions with Obstacle 1. A better approach would be to navigate around Obstacle 1 first before approaching the goal set.

1. **Navigate around Obstacle 1:** Starting from the start set, we can move horizontally to the right, staying clear of Obstacle 1's left edge. 
2. **Proceed towards the goal set:** Once we've passed Obstacle 1, we can safely move upwards and approach the goal set. 

Considering this strategy, the revised path could look like this:

```
new_path = [
    (0.1, 0.2),   # Start within the start set
    (2.0, 0.2),   # Move right, clear of Obstacle 1
    (2.0, 2.6),   # Move upwards, towards the goal set
    (3.2, 2.6)    # Move right to reach the goal set
]
```

This path ensures a safe distance from Obstacle 1 by initially moving horizontally. It then changes direction to approach the goal set, avoiding any intersections with the obstacle. Remember to double-check this path against the actual obstacle coordinates to guarantee a collision-free trajectory.

]

[08/22/2024 08:50:41 AM] The initial path fails to navigate around the obstacles. Let's analyze the environment to craft a successful path.

1. **Starting Point:** We can use the initial starting point (0.1, 0.2) as it sits within the start set.

2. **Navigating Obstacles:**
    -  Obstacle 2 presents an immediate hurdle moving directly right.  We need to move upwards initially to avoid it. 
    -  Obstacle 1 sits to the right, partially blocking the path to the goal.  

3. **Finding a Waypoint:** A safe waypoint can be established above both obstacles, allowing for a clear path to the right. Let's choose (0.1, 5.0).

4. **Moving Right:** From (0.1, 5.0), we can safely move rightwards, clearing both obstacles. Let's target a point horizontally aligned with the goal set, for example (3.2, 5.0).

5. **Reaching the Goal:**  Finally, descend directly downwards from (3.2, 5.0) to (3.2, 2.6), a point safely within the goal set.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.1, 0.2),  # Start
    (0.1, 5.0),  # Move above obstacles
    (3.2, 5.0),  # Move right, clearing obstacles
    (3.2, 2.6)   # Descend into goal set
]
```

This revised path successfully avoids both obstacles while adhering to the start and goal set constraints.

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:50:47 AM] The provided path attempts to go above obstacle 1 but fails to account for its shape extending further left. Additionally, it doesn't fully plan for the space occupied by Obstacle 2.

We can construct a successful path by moving below all obstacles. 

1. **Start:** We can utilize the same starting point, (0.1, 0.2).
2. **Downward Movement:** Move further down to y = -0.5 to clearly bypass the bottom vertex of Obstacle 1. This gives us an intermediate waypoint (0.1, -0.5).
3. **Rightward Movement:** Move rightwards towards the goal, staying below Obstacle 2. A safe y-coordinate to clear all obstacles is -0.5. We can overshoot the goal horizontally to around x = 3.2, resulting in waypoint (3.2, -0.5).
4. **Upward Movement:**  Finally, move upwards to reach the goal set. We can end at (3.2, 2.6), which is already part of the previous path and lies comfortably within the goal set.

Therefore, a corrected path is:

```
new_path = [(0.1, 0.2), (0.1, -0.5), (3.2, -0.5), (3.2, 2.6)]
```

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]

			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:50:54 AM] The original path was trying to cross Obstacle 2 directly which is problematic. I'll adjust the path to go around this obstacle.

1. **Start:** Keep the starting point within the start set at (0.1, 0.2).
2. **Go above Obstacle 2:**  Obstacle 2 extends the furthest in the positive y-direction. To avoid it, the path needs to go above its highest point (y = 3.5).  Let's aim for a waypoint at (0.1, 4.0). 
3. **Move right:** From (0.1, 4.0), we can safely move horizontally towards the goal. Let's add a waypoint at (3.2, 4.0) to ensure clearance from Obstacle 1.
4. **Descend to Goal:** Finally, move down from (3.2, 4.0) to a point within the goal set. (3.2, 2.6) is a suitable endpoint.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.1, 0.2),  
    (0.1, 4.0),  
    (3.2, 4.0),

[08/22/2024 08:51:19 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate directly to the goal region but intersects with Obstacle 1 multiple times. To correct this, the path needs to maneuver around Obstacle 1. 

Analyzing the environment, we see that Obstacle 1 extends significantly in the positive y-direction. Therefore, we can adjust the path to first move below Obstacle 1 before approaching the goal region.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.1, 0.2),    # Start within the start set
    (0.1, -0.5),   # Move below Obstacle 1
    (4.0, -0.5),   # Move right, staying below Obstacle 1
    (3.2, 2.6)    # Move up to the goal within the goal set
]
```

This path avoids intersecting Obstacle 1 by going below its lowest point and then proceeds towards the goal region.

[08/22/2024 08:51:26 AM] The initial path was going through Obstacle 2. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle. 

1. **Starting Point:** Keep the starting point at (0.1, 0.2).
2. **Navigating Obstacle 2:**  
    *  Since Obstacle 2 extends significantly in the positive y-direction, it's easier to go around it from below. 
    *  Move down further to (0.1, -1.5) to ensure clearance from Obstacle 2's lowest point.
    *  Move rightward to (7.5, -1.5) to be clear of Obstacle 2's rightmost point. 
3. **Reaching the Goal:**
    * Now we have a clear path to the goal. Move upwards to (7.5, 2.6) to align with the goal's y-coordinate.
    * Finally, move left to (3.2, 2.6) to reach within the goal set.

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:51:33 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate around the obstacles by going below them. However, the chosen waypoints result in collisions. To correct this, the path should be adjusted to go above obstacle 2 while staying clear of obstacle 1.

Here's a possible approach and a revised path:

1. **Starting Point:** Keep the starting point within the start set at (0.1, 0.2).

2. **Navigating Above Obstacle 2:**
   - Move vertically upwards to a point above the highest point of obstacle 2. Let's choose (0.1, 4.0). 
   - Move horizontally to the right, staying above obstacle 2. A suitable waypoint could be (7.5, 4.0). 

3. **Reaching the Goal Set:**
   - From (7.5, 4.0), move downwards to a point within the goal set.  (3.2, 2.6) is a suitable endpoint.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [(0.1, 0.2), (0.1, 4.0), (7.5, 4.0), (3.2, 2.6)] 
```

This revised path avoids both obstacles:

- It stays clear of obstacle 1 by moving vertically upwards first.
- It clears obstacle 2 by maintaining a height greater than its highest point.

]

[08/22/2024 08:51:40 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate above obstacle 1, but in doing so, it creates intersections. To correct this, we need to reroute the path to go around obstacle 1 while staying clear of obstacle 2. 

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Start Point:** Keep the starting point within the start set, for instance, (0.1, 0.2).
2. **Navigate Downwards:**  Instead of moving upwards, guide the path downwards to go around obstacle 1. A point like (0.1, -1.0) could work as it puts the path well below obstacle 1.
3. **Move Right:**  From there, move rightwards, staying below obstacle 1. A waypoint like (6.0, -1.0) places the path to the right of obstacle 1 and clear of obstacle 2.
4. **Navigate Upwards:** Finally, move upwards towards the goal set. A suitable endpoint could be (3.2, 2.6), which lies within the goal set.

Therefore, a revised path might look like this:

```
new_path = [(0.1, 0.2), (0.1, -1.0), (6.0, -1.0), (3.2, 2.6)] 
```

This new path avoids intersecting both obstacles while adhering to the start and end set requirements.

[08/22/2024 08:51:47 AM] The primary issue with the previous path was that it attempted to pass through Obstacle 2. To correct this, we can leverage the fact that Obstacle 2 doesn't extend below the y-axis.  

Here's the thought process for the new path:

1. **Start:** We can keep the starting point at (0.1, 0.2), which is within the start set.
2. **Navigate Below Obstacle 2:** Move downwards to a point below Obstacle 2. A safe waypoint could be (0.1, -1.5).
3. **Clear Obstacle 2:** Move rightwards to a point clear of Obstacle 2. We need to ensure this point has a larger x-coordinate than the rightmost point of Obstacle 2. A safe waypoint could be (7.5, -1.5).
4. **Approach Goal:** Move upwards towards the goal set.  A waypoint at (7.5, 3.0) aligns well.
5. **Enter Goal:**  Finally, move leftwards directly into the goal set. A possible endpoint is (3.2, 3.0).

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.1, 0.2), 
    (0.1, -1.5), 
    (7.5, -1.5),

    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:51:54 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate around the obstacles by going below them. However, this approach leads to collisions. 

To correct this, let's adjust the path to go above obstacle 2:

1.  **Start Point:** Keep the start point within the start set: (0.1, 0.2).
2.  **Navigate Above Obstacle 2:** To avoid obstacle 2, the path needs to go above its highest point (y = 3.5). Let's aim for a y-coordinate of 4.0.
3.  **Clear Obstacle 1:**  Before moving horizontally, ensure the path clears the rightmost point of Obstacle 1 (x = 5.56). We can set the x-coordinate to 6.0.
4.  **Approach Goal Set:** Now, move horizontally towards the goal set. A waypoint at (6.0, 3.0) seems suitable.
5.  **End Point:** Finally, move down into the goal set. An appropriate end point could be (3.2, 3.0).

Therefore, the modified path is as follows:

```
new_path = [(0.1, 0.2), (0.1, 4.0), (6.0, 4.0), (6.0, 3.0), (3.2, 3.0)] 
```

This new path addresses the collision issues and provides a clear path from the start to the goal set.

[08/22/2024 08:52:28 AM] The initial path was trying to navigate above obstacle 1 and then towards the goal. However, the chosen waypoints created intersections with both obstacles. 

To correct this, we can visualize a path that goes below both obstacles. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.1, 0.2),  # Start within the start set
    (0.1, -0.5), # Move downwards to a point clearly below both obstacles 
    (7.0, -0.5), # Move rightwards, staying below the obstacles
    (7.0, 3.0),  # Move upwards to align with the goal set
    (3.2, 3.0)   # Move leftwards to end within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(0.1, 0.2):** We start at the same point within the start set.
2. **(0.1, -0.5):**  From the start, we move downwards to a y-value that's clearly below the lowest points of both obstacles.
3. **(7.0, -0.5):** We move to the right, maintaining the same y-value, ensuring we're clear of both obstacles. 
4. **(7.0, 3.0):**  We move upwards to a y-value that aligns with the goal set.
5. **(3.2, 3.0):** Finally, we move leftwards to a point within the goal set. 

This new path avoids both obstacles by going around them in a clockwise manner.

[08/22/2024 08:52:34 AM] The previous path was trying to navigate below the obstacles but got stuck due to their shape and positioning. This time we will try to navigate above obstacle 1 and 2 to reach the goal.

1. **Starting Point:** We can start at the same point as before (0.1, 0.2) inside the start set.
2. **Navigating Obstacles:** We need to move above obstacle 1, so let's go vertically up to a point (0.1, 7.0) ensuring we clear the highest point of both obstacles.
3. **Moving towards the goal:** Now we can safely move horizontally towards the goal, going to a point (7.0, 7.0) clearing all obstacles. 
4. **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, move down into the goal set at a point like (3.2, 3.0).

Therefore, the updated path is:

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]

			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.

        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:52:46 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate under obstacle 2, but the chosen waypoints lead to collisions. The strategy should be revised to go above obstacle 2 instead.

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Start Point:** (0.1, 0.2) - This point is within the start set and suitable for the revised path.

2. **Navigate Upwards:** Move vertically upwards to a point above the upper boundary of obstacle 2.  A suitable waypoint could be (0.1, 4.0).

3. **Move Towards the Goal:**  Move horizontally towards the goal set. A waypoint like (3.0, 4.0) would put the path near the goal without intersecting obstacles. 

4. **Reach the Goal:** Finally, move downwards to a point within the goal set.  The point (3.2, 3.0) from the original path is a suitable endpoint.


**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.1, 0.2),   
    (0.1, 4.0),   
    (3.0, 4.0),

]

[08/22/2024 08:52:52 AM] The original path attempts to navigate directly to the goal set but intersects with Obstacle 1 multiple times. A viable path requires circumventing this obstacle.

First, I'll maintain the initial waypoint within the start set at (0.1, 0.2).  To avoid Obstacle 1, the path needs to steer clear of its bottom-most vertex at approximately (5.56, 4.37).  

Therefore, the next waypoint should be above this point. Let's choose (0.1, 5.0).  From here, the path can move horizontally to the right, clearing the obstacle.  A suitable waypoint for this would be (6.0, 5.0).

Finally, the path can descend to a point within the goal set.  The point (3.5, 3.0) suffices.

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.1, 0.2), 
    (0.1, 5.0), 
    (6.0, 5.0), 
    (3.5, 3.0)

[08/22/2024 08:52:57 AM] The original path attempts to navigate directly from the start to the end set. However, this results in collisions with Obstacle 1. To avoid this, we need to route the path around this obstacle. 

1. **Initial Movement:** We can keep the starting point within the start set. To avoid early collisions, let's direct the path upwards, aiming for a y-coordinate above Obstacle 1's highest point. 

2. **Navigating Around Obstacle 1:** From our elevated position, we can extend the path rightwards, ensuring we stay clear of Obstacle 1's vertices.  

3. **Approaching the Goal:** With Obstacle 1 circumvented, we can now angle the path downwards towards the goal set, ensuring the final waypoint sits comfortably within its boundaries.

[08/22/2024 08:53:22 AM] The original path attempts to navigate above obstacle 1. However, both segments moving vertically and then horizontally towards the goal intersect this obstacle. 

**Proposed Path:**

To avoid this, we can adjust the path to go below obstacle 1. We can then navigate around the right side of obstacle 1 to access the goal.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.1, 0.2),  # Start within the start set
    (0.1, -0.5),  # Move downwards, clear of obstacle 2
    (6.0, -0.5),  # Move rightwards, clear of obstacle 1 
    (3.5, 3.0)   # Move to the goal within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

*   **Waypoint 2:** Moved downwards to (0.1, -0.5) to go below both obstacles.
*   **Waypoint 3:** Moved rightwards to (6.0, -0.5), staying below obstacle 1.
*   **Waypoint 4:** Remains unchanged, as it's already a suitable endpoint within the goal set. 

This adjusted path avoids all obstacles and successfully reaches the goal.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    Obstacle Avoidance (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
		Segment 1 between points (0.1, 0.2) and (0.1, -0.5) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]
		Segment 2 between points (0.1, -0.5) and (6.0, -0.5) intersects with obstacle(s):

		Segment 3 between points (6.0, -0.5) and (3.5, 3.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 08:53:29 AM] The initial path was trying to navigate under Obstacle 2, but the obstacle extends far to the right, making this approach unsuccessful. 

Instead of going under, the path can be adjusted to go above Obstacle 2. Since Obstacle 1 spans from a low y-coordinate to a high one, the path needs to navigate to the right before going up.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.1, 0.2),    # Start within the start set
    (2.0, 0.2),    # Move right, staying below Obstacle 2
    (2.0, 4.0),    # Move upwards, clearing Obstacle 2 
    (3.5, 3.0)     # Move to a point within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1.  **Move Right First:** Instead of immediately moving down, the path now prioritizes moving to the right. This gets it out of the way of Obstacle 1's vertical span.
2.  **Then Upwards:**  Once clear of Obstacle 1's x-coordinate range, the path moves upwards to a y-coordinate that is safely above Obstacle 2.
3.  **Finally to Goal:** From this position above Obstacle 2, it's a simple maneuver to reach the goal set.

[08/22/2024 08:53:36 AM] The provided path intersects with all obstacles. It appears that the path attempts to navigate through a gap between obstacles 1 and 2, but the waypoints are not strategically placed to avoid intersection.

Here's a revised approach:

1. **Start Point:**  We can keep the start point (0.1, 0.2) as it lies within the start set.

2. **Navigating Obstacles:** The key is to find a path that goes above Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2.  We can achieve this by:
    *  Moving vertically upward from the start point to a point above the upper boundary of both obstacles.  A safe y-coordinate could be 7.0.
    *  Moving horizontally to a point aligned with the goal set. A safe x-coordinate could be 3.5.
    *  Moving vertically downward to enter the goal set.

3. **End Point:** We can choose the point (3.5, 3.0) as it lies within the goal set.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.1, 0.2),    
    (0.1, 7.0), 
    (3.5, 7.0),
    (3.5, 3.0)
]
```

This new path avoids all obstacles by first moving vertically to a point above the obstacles, then horizontally towards the goal, and finally vertically down into the goal set.

[08/22/2024 08:53:42 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate above Obstacle 1. However, both the upward and downward segments intersect this obstacle. A more suitable approach involves navigating below Obstacle 1 and steering clear of Obstacle 2.

Here's a possible path considering the obstacle positions:

1. **Start:** (0.1, 0.2) - This point lies within the start set.

2. **Move Right:** (2.0, 0.2) - Move horizontally to the right, staying below Obstacle 1 and avoiding the negatively extending region of Obstacle 2.

3. **Move Upwards:** (2.0, 2.5) -  Move upwards, staying clear of the rightmost vertex of Obstacle 1.

4. **Move Right:** (3.5, 2.5) - Move right towards the goal set, ensuring to be above the top vertex of Obstacle 2.

5. **Reach Goal:** (3.5, 3.0) - This point lies within the goal set.

Therefore, the adjusted path is:
