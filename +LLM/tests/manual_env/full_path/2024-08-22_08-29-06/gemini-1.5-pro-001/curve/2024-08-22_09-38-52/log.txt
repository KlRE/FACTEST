# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

[08/22/2024 09:39:16 AM] The initial path attempts to go above obstacles 6 and 10, but intersects them. 

**Changes:**

1. **Navigate between Obstacles:**  Instead of going over, the path needs to navigate between obstacles 6 and 7, and then between obstacles 9 and 10. 

2. **Added Waypoints:** To achieve this, we'll add waypoints to guide the path safely.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),      // Start in the start set
    (-3.5, 7.5),      // Move up to avoid obstacle 7
    (1.0, 7.5),       // Move right, staying clear of obstacle 7
    (1.0, 8.5),       // Move up to navigate between obstacles 6 and 7
    (7.0, 8.5),       // Move right, staying clear of obstacle 10
    (7.0, 6.5),      // Move down 
    (5.5, 6.5)       // End in the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

* The path first moves slightly up to avoid obstacle 7.
* It then proceeds right, maintaining a safe distance from obstacles 6 and 7.
* Next, it moves right again, staying clear of obstacle 10.
* Finally, it moves down to the goal set. 

This new path avoids all obstacles and successfully connects the start and goal sets.

]

[08/22/2024 09:39:24 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate directly from the start to the end set. However, it runs into obstacles, particularly obstacles 3, 7, and 10. 

To correct the path, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Starting Point:**  (-3.5, 6.5) is fine.
2. **Navigating Obstacles:**
    * Instead of directly heading towards the goal, we need to first navigate around obstacle 7.  We can do this by moving upwards to ( -3.5, 9.5), clearing the obstacle.
    * Next, to avoid obstacle 3, we'll move rightwards to (1.0, 9.5). 
    * We can now safely pass obstacle 10 by moving rightwards again to (7.0, 9.5).
3. **Reaching the Goal:** 
    * Finally, we can descend to the goal set by moving downwards to (7.0, 6.5) and then to (5.5, 6.5).

**New Path:**

```

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:39:31 AM] The initial path attempts to go above obstacles 6 and 10. However, the segments cross into these obstacles. To correct this, we can reroute the path to go below all the obstacles.

Here's the thought process for adjusting the path:

1. **Start:** Keep the starting point at (-3.5, 6.5). 
2. **Navigate below obstacles:** Move downwards to a y-coordinate below all obstacles. For instance, y = -2.0 should be safe. Add a waypoint at (-3.5, -2.0).
3. **Traverse horizontally:** Move rightwards, staying below the obstacles, until reaching a point below the goal set. Add a waypoint at (5.5, -2.0).
4. **Reach the goal:** Move upwards to the goal set. Keep the ending point at (5.5, 6.5).

Therefore, the corrected path is:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),
    (-3.5, -2.0),
    (5.5, -2.0),
    (5.5, 6.5)
]
```

]

[08/22/2024 09:39:39 AM] The original path goes straight down and collides with obstacle 1. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around the left side of the obstacles.

The first waypoint should be adjusted to go around obstacle 1. It can be moved left to (-4.5, 6.5) and then down to (-4.5, 5.5).  From there, it needs to clear obstacles 7 and 3. A waypoint at (-4.5, 4.5) achieves this. 

Next, the path needs to navigate to the right, avoiding obstacle 8. A waypoint at (1.0, 4.5) allows the path to move rightward above obstacle 8.

Finally, the path can go straight to the goal from this point.

Here's the corrected path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  # Start point
    (-4.5, 6.5),  # Move left 
    (-4.5, 5.5),  # Move down, clearing obstacle 1

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:39:55 AM] The issue is with the path going from (-4.5, 4.5) to (1.0, 4.5), as this line goes directly through Obstacle 3. To fix this, the path needs to move below Obstacle 3 before proceeding to the right.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5), 
    (-4.5, 6.5), 
    (-4.5, 5.5), 
    (-4.5, 4.5), 
    (-4.5, 2.5),  # Move down to clear Obstacle 3
    (1.0, 2.5),  # Move right, staying clear of Obstacle 3
    (1.0, 3.5), 
    (3.0, 3.5), 
    (3.0, 4.5), 
    (5.5, 6.5)
]
```

Here's the thought process:

1. **Identify the problem:** The original path segment from (-4.5, 4.5) to (1.0, 4.5) intersects Obstacle 3.
2. **Find a safe passage:**  We need to navigate around Obstacle 3. The best option is to move down below its lowest point and then proceed right.
3. **Add waypoints:**
   - Add a waypoint at (-4.5, 2.5) to move down clear of Obstacle 3.
   - Add a waypoint at (1.0, 2.5) to move right while remaining below Obstacle 3.
4. **Connect to the existing path:** The rest of the path remains valid and can be connected to the new waypoints.

]

[08/22/2024 09:40:30 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate directly from the start to the end set, which results in collisions with obstacles 2 and 8. To rectify this, the path should be adjusted to circumnavigate these obstacles.

First, instead of going straight to the right from the starting point, the path can be modified to move downwards, going around the left side of obstacles 2 and 8. This can be achieved by adding a waypoint below obstacle 2.

Next, the path needs to safely navigate to the right, towards the goal set. Given the position of obstacle 8, it's more efficient to move above it. 

Therefore, a waypoint above obstacle 8 will be added. From there, the path can proceed directly to the right towards the goal set without encountering further obstacles.

Here is the modified path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5), 
    (-4.5, 6.5), 
    (-4.5, 5.5), 
    (-4.5, -1.5),  # Move down, clearing obstacle 2
    (1.5, -1.5),   # Move right, staying below obstacle 8
    (1.5, 3.5),   # Move up, clearing obstacle 8
    (3.0, 3.5), 
    (3.0, 4.5), 
    (5.5, 6.5)
]
```

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:40:40 AM] The issue is that the path tries to cut straight through the middle, encountering obstacles 2 and 8. It needs to navigate around these obstacles to reach the goal.

Here's a possible revised path:

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),   # Start within the start set
    (-4.5, 6.5),   # Move slightly left 
    (-4.5, 4.5),   # Move up, staying clear of obstacles 6 & 7
    (-4.5, -2.5),  # Move down, passing south of obstacles 2 & 8
    (1.5, -2.5),   # Move right, staying clear of obstacle 8
    (1.5, 3.5),    # Move up, passing north of obstacle 4
    (3.0, 3.5),    # Continue right
    (3.0, 4.5),    # Move up 
    (5.5, 6.5)     # Move to the goal set
] 
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1.  **Initial Maneuvering:** The path starts similar to the original but makes a more decisive move upwards to avoid obstacles 6 and 7.
2.  **Going South:** Instead of attempting to go through the middle, the path takes a detour south, going below obstacle 2 and 8. 
3.  **Moving Right and Up:** The path then moves right, staying clear of obstacle 8's lower corner, before heading north again to avoid obstacle 4. 
4.  **Final Approach:** The final segments of the path are adjusted slightly to ensure a clear and direct path to the goal set. 

This new path avoids all obstacles while staying within the defined start and goal areas.

## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements

]

[08/22/2024 09:40:52 AM] The feedback indicates that the segment connecting (1.5, -2.5) and (1.5, 3.5) intersects Obstacle 8. Looking at the coordinates of Obstacle 8, we see that it spans from x = -1.0 to x = 3.0 and from y = -2.0 to y = 2.0. 

Our problematic segment travels vertically along the line x = 1.5, which is directly through the middle of Obstacle 8. To circumvent this, we can route the path around Obstacle 8.

Here's a possible adjustment:

1. **From the previous waypoint:** Instead of going directly upwards to (1.5, 3.5), we need to navigate around Obstacle 8.

2. **Go left:**  Since the obstacle extends further to the right, let's move leftwards, going around the obstacle to its left side. A good waypoint could be (-0.5, -2.5), ensuring we are clear from the obstacle's bottom-left corner.

3. **Move upwards:** Now we can safely move upwards, clearing the obstacle. A suitable waypoint would be (-0.5, 3.5).

4. **Connect to the next waypoint:** Finally, move rightwards to rejoin the original path at (1.5, 3.5).

Therefore, the adjusted segment would be: (1.5, -2.5) -> (-0.5, -2.5) -> (-0.5, 3.5) -> (1.5, 3.5).

Here's the updated path:

[08/22/2024 09:41:00 AM] The path needs adjustments to avoid colliding with Obstacles 2 and 8.  Here's a possible fix with the reasoning:

    * **(1.5, -2.5):**  (Existing waypoint, maintained for continuity)
    * **(1.5, -0.5):**  Move upward, staying clear of Obstacle 2's lower-right corner.

## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[6.0, 7.0], [5.0, 7.0], [5.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[-2.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0], [-2.0, -1.0], [0.0, -1.0]]

			Obstacle 10: [[6.0, 10.0], [4.0, 10.0], [4.0, 8.0], [6.0, 8.0]]

    
## Your generated path:
    path = [(-3.5, 6.5), (-4.5, 6.5), (-4.5, 4.5), (-4.5, -2.5), (1.5, -2.5), (1.5, -0.5), (1.5, 3.5), (3.0, 3.5), (3.0, 4.5), (5.5, 6.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    Obstacle Avoidance (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
		Segment 5 between points (1.5, -2.5) and (1.5, -0.5) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 8: [[-1.0, 0.0], [1.0, -2.0], [3.0, 0.0], [1.0, 2.0]]
		Segment 6 between points (1.5, -0.5) and (1.5, 3.5) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 8: [[-1.0, 0.0], [1.0, -2.0], [3.0, 0.0], [1.0, 2.0]]
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:41:09 AM] The path intersects with Obstacle 8 because it attempts to go directly upwards from y = -2.5 to y = -0.5, crossing the obstacle's x-span at x = 1.5. To rectify this, the path needs to navigate around Obstacle 8.

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Maintain the downward trajectory:** The path is already moving downwards to avoid obstacles, so continue this trajectory. 
2. **Circumvent Obstacle 8:** Instead of going straight up, guide the path around the right side of Obstacle 8.
3. **Proceed towards the goal:**  After clearing Obstacle 8, the path can resume its trajectory towards the goal.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5), 
    (-4.5, 6.5), 
    (-4.5, 4.5), 
    (-4.5, -2.5),
    (1.5, -2.5),  
    (2.5, -2.5),  # Go around obstacle 8 on the right
    (2.5, 3.5),   # Move upwards after clearing the obstacle 
    (3.0, 3.5),   
    (3.0, 4.5), 
    (5.5, 6.5)
]
```

This adjusted path avoids Obstacle 8 by navigating around it while maintaining a safe distance.

[08/22/2024 09:41:19 AM] The path intersects with obstacles 4 and 8 because it attempts to go in a straight line from (-4.5, -2.5) to (2.5, 3.5). 

To avoid this, we can adjust the path to go around these obstacles.  We can achieve this with the following changes:

1.  From (-4.5, -2.5), move further left to (-5.5, -2.5) to clear obstacle 8.
2.  Move upward to (-5.5, 0.5) to clear obstacle 4. 
3.  Move right towards (2.5, 0.5) to allow for an upward trajectory.
4.  Finally, move upward to (2.5, 3.5) to reconnect with the original path. 

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5), 
    (-4.5, 6.5), 
    (-4.5, 4.5), 
    (-4.5, -2.5),

[08/22/2024 09:41:32 AM] The path needs significant adjustments to avoid obstacles in the center of the environment.  Here's a breakdown of the changes and the reasoning:

1. **Initial Maneuvering:** The path starts well.  Keeping the initial waypoints at (-3.5, 6.5), (-4.5, 6.5), (-4.5, 4.5) ensures a clear path around obstacles 6 and 7.

2. **Navigating the Central Obstacles:** The problematic segment starts at (-4.5, 4.5). Instead of going directly down, we need to navigate around obstacles 1, 2, and 8.

    * **Waypoint 1:** Add a waypoint to the left of obstacle 1 at (-5.5, 4.5). 
    * **Waypoint 2:**  Continue left to a point below obstacle 2 at (-5.5, -0.5).
    * **Waypoint 3:** Move right, staying below obstacles 2 and 4, to a point at (2.5, -0.5). 

3. **Approaching the Goal:** From (2.5, -0.5), the path can proceed upwards.

    * **Waypoint 4:** Add a waypoint above obstacles 4 and 8 at (2.5, 3.5).
    * **Waypoint 5:** Continue to a point between obstacles 3 and 9 at (3.0, 3.5).

4. **Final Approach:** The remaining waypoints can be adjusted to smoothly reach the goal.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:41:41 AM] The original path attempts to navigate through a space crowded with obstacles, leading to collisions. To rectify this, we should adjust the path to take advantage of the open space available. Instead of directly going down and trying to navigate between obstacles near the y-axis, the path should be modified to leverage the open space around the obstacle cluster. 

Here’s how we can adjust the path:

1. **Starting Point:** Maintain the starting point of (-3.5, 6.5).

2. **Navigate Upwards:**  Since there's ample space above the start set, guide the path upwards to (-3.5, 8.5) to avoid Obstacle 6 and 7. 

3. **Move Rightwards:**  With a clear path above the obstacles, proceed horizontally to the right, reaching (5.5, 8.5) above the goal set.

4. **Descend to Goal:** Finally, navigate downwards from (5.5, 8.5) to (5.5, 6.5), ending within the goal set.

This revised path avoids all obstacles by taking advantage of the open space available. 

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5), 
    (-3.5, 8.5), 
    (5.5, 8.5), 
    (5.5, 6.5)
]

[08/22/2024 09:41:48 AM] The initial path goes through obstacles 6 and 10. To avoid this, the path needs to be adjusted to navigate around these obstacles.

1. **Start to Safe Passage:**  The path can start at (-3.5, 6.5) and initially move upwards to (-3.5, 9.5) staying clear of obstacle 6. 
2. **Navigating to the Goal Side:** From (-3.5, 9.5), the path can move right, going above obstacle 6 and 10 to a point like (7.5, 9.5).
3. **Descending to Goal:** Finally, the path can move downwards from (7.5, 9.5) to (7.5, 6.5) and then to (5.5, 6.5) to reach the goal set without intersecting any obstacles.

1. **Starting Point:** We can keep the same starting point (-3.5, 6.5).

2. **Navigating Obstacles 6 & 7:**
    * Instead of going directly upwards, we can navigate between obstacles 6 and 7.
    * A waypoint at (-3.5, 7.5) takes us above obstacle 7. 
    * From there, we can move right, staying above obstacle 7 with a waypoint at (0, 7.5).

3. **Navigating to the Goal:**
    *  We can continue moving right, staying clear of obstacle 10 with a waypoint at (2, 7.5). 
    *  Finally, move down to enter the goal set at (5.5, 6.5).

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  # Start
    (-3.5, 7.5),  # Move up, clearing obstacle 7
    (0, 7.5),     # Move right, staying above obstacle 7
    (2, 7.5),     # Continue right, clearing obstacle 10
    (5.5, 6.5)   # Move down into the goal set 
]

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[6.0, 7.0], [5.0, 7.0], [5.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[-2.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0]]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:42:03 AM] The initial path was trying to go above obstacles 3 and 7, but the segment crossed into their boundaries. We need to reroute the path to go below these obstacles. 

Let's modify the path with the following waypoints:

1. **Start:** (-3.5, 6.5) - Remains the same, starting within the start set.
2. **Waypoint 2:** (-3.5, 5.5) - Move downwards, clearing obstacle 7. 
3. **Waypoint 3:** (0.0, 5.5)  - Move rightwards, staying below obstacles 7 and 3.
4. **Waypoint 4:** (2.0, 5.5) - Continue moving rightwards, staying below obstacle 9.
5. **Waypoint 5:** (5.5, 6.5) -  Remains the same, moving upwards to reach the goal set.

This adjusted path avoids all obstacles:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5), 
    (-3.5, 5.5), 
    (0.0, 5.5),

[08/22/2024 09:42:28 AM] The initial path attempted to take a straight line above the obstacles, but intersected with Obstacles 6 and 10. To correct this, the path needs to navigate around these obstacles.

1. **Start:** Keep starting point at (-3.5, 6.5).
2. **Navigate Right:** Move right, staying clear of Obstacle 6. A safe waypoint could be (0.0, 6.5).
3. **Navigate Upwards:**  Continue moving right, then turn upwards to clear Obstacle 10. A safe waypoint could be (2.0, 9.0). 
4. **Approach Goal:**  Continue moving right towards the goal set, passing above Obstacle 10.  A safe waypoint could be (5.5, 9.0).
5. **Enter Goal:** Finally, move down into the goal set and end at (5.5, 6.5).

**New Path:**
```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),
    (0.0, 6.5),
    (2.0, 9.0),
    (5.5, 9.0),
    (5.5, 6.5)
]
```
