# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

[08/22/2024 09:27:37 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate above obstacles 6 and 10. However, the chosen waypoints result in collisions. To rectify this, we can adjust the path to go below these obstacles. 

Here's the thought process for the corrected path:

1. **Start Point:** We can maintain the initial starting point of (-3.5, 6.5).

2. **Navigate Below Obstacles:** Instead of going above obstacles 6 and 10, we'll route the path below them. A waypoint at (-3.5, 5.0) would place us below obstacle 6.

3. **Avoid Obstacles 7 & 9:**  We need to navigate around obstacles 7 and 9. A waypoint at (-1.0, 5.0) allows us to move past obstacle 7. Then, we can use a waypoint at (1.0, 5.0) to circumvent obstacle 9.

4. **Approach the Goal:**  With obstacles cleared, we can proceed towards the goal. A waypoint at (3.0, 5.0) positions us directly below the goal set. 

5. **Reach the Goal:**  Finally, we can move upwards and end the path within the goal set at (5.5, 6.5).

Therefore, the corrected path is: 

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5), 
    (-3.5, 5.0), 
    (-1.0, 5.0),

[08/22/2024 09:27:45 AM] The path intersects with Obstacle 3 because it attempts to move directly from left to right at a y-coordinate of 5.0. We need to adjust the path to go around this obstacle. 

Here's a possible approach:

1.  **Maintain initial segment:** The first segment from (-3.5, 6.5) to (-3.5, 5.0) is acceptable.
2.  **Navigate below Obstacle 3:** Instead of moving directly right, let's go below Obstacle 3:
    *   Add a waypoint at (-3.5, 3.5) to move below the obstacle.
    *   Add another waypoint at (1.0, 3.5) to clear the obstacle horizontally.
3.  **Proceed towards the goal:** 
    *   Add a waypoint at (3.0, 3.5) to position the path for entry into the goal set.
    *   Connect to the goal set with a waypoint at (5.5, 6.5). 

This new path avoids Obstacle 3 while respecting the other constraints.
