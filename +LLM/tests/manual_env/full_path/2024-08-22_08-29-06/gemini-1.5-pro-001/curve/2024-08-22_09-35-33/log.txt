# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[6.0, 7.0], [5.0, 7.0], [5.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[-2.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0]]

[08/22/2024 09:35:46 AM] The initial path went through several obstacles. To fix this, the path needs to navigate around obstacles 6 and 3 on the left side of the map, then curve downwards to the goal, avoiding obstacles 9 and 10.

Here's a possible new path:

1. **Start:** (-3.5, 6.5) -  Same starting point.
2. **Move above obstacles 6 & 7:** (-3.5, 11.0) -  Go straight up to avoid obstacles 6 and 7.
3. **Navigate towards the center:** (1.0, 11.0) - Move horizontally to the right, staying above obstacle 3.
4. **Descend between obstacles 3 & 9:** (1.0, 5.0) -  Move straight down, passing between obstacles 3 and 9.
5. **Approach the goal:** (3.0, 5.0) - Move horizontally towards the goal, staying clear of obstacle 9.
6. **Enter the goal set:** (5.5, 6.5) -  Same ending point.

[08/22/2024 09:35:58 AM] The initial path has several intersections with the obstacles. To correct this, I will analyze the path segment by segment and make the following adjustments:

1. **Segment 1 ( (-3.5, 6.5) to (-3.5, 11.0) )**: This segment intersects with Obstacle 6. To avoid this, we can make the path go around Obstacle 6. Since the goal is to the right, let's guide the path to the right of Obstacle 6. 

2. **Segment 2 ( (-3.5, 11.0) to (1.0, 11.0) )**: This segment is now clear as we are going around Obstacle 6 from the right.

3. **Segment 3 ( (1.0, 11.0) to (1.0, 5.0) )**: This segment intersects with Obstacle 3. Since we went around Obstacle 6 to the right, we should aim to go around Obstacle 3 to the right as well to maintain a consistent direction.  

4. **Segment 4 ( (1.0, 5.0) to (3.0, 5.0) )**: This segment also intersects with Obstacle 3. We will adjust it while addressing segment 3.

5. **Segment 5 ( (3.0, 5.0) to (5.5, 6.5) )**: This segment is clear and leads directly to the goal set.

Therefore, considering these adjustments, a possible corrected path is:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),    
    (-3.5, 11.0),   
    (3.0, 11.0),   
    (3.0, 5.0),    
    (5.5, 6.5)     
]
```

This new path avoids all obstacles:

- It goes around Obstacle 6 by moving to the right before changing its y-coordinate.
- It avoids Obstacle 3 by maintaining a y-coordinate of 11.0 until it's clear to move down towards the goal. 

This path ensures a safe and collision-free trajectory from the start to the goal set.

[08/22/2024 09:36:15 AM] The original path attempts to go above obstacles 6 and 9. However, the line segments cross into these obstacles. To correct this, we can route the path between obstacles 6 and 7, and then between obstacles 9 and 10. 

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  # Start point
    (-3.5, 7.5),  # Move up to go between obstacles 6 and 7
    (1.0, 7.5),   # Move right, staying between obstacles 6 & 7 and 9 & 10
    (1.0, 6.5),   # Move down to go between obstacles 3 and 9 
    (3.0, 6.5),  # Move right, staying below obstacle 3
    (5.5, 6.5)   # End point 
]

This path avoids all obstacles while staying within the start and goal sets.

[08/22/2024 09:36:24 AM] The initial path attempts to take a straight route to the goal, which causes collisions with multiple obstacles. A more nuanced approach is required.

* **Vertical Corridor:**  There's a clear vertical corridor between obstacles 2 & 4 and obstacles 5 & 8. 
* **Horizontal Maneuvering:** Once past obstacle 3, there's ample space to move horizontally towards the goal.

**Adjusted Path:**

1. **Start:** (-3.5, 6.5) -  Same starting point.
2. **Downwards:** (-3.5, 5.5) - Move down, staying clear of obstacle 7.
3. **Navigate Corridor:** (-3.5, 0.5) - Continue downwards, staying within the vertical corridor.
4. **Clear Obstacles:** (1.5, 0.5) - Move right, clearing obstacles 2 and 4.

[08/22/2024 09:36:31 AM] The original path attempts to navigate through the obstacles in a fairly direct manner, leading to collisions.  A safer approach involves identifying larger gaps and maneuvering around obstacle clusters.

Starting at (-3.5, 6.5), we can observe a clear path upwards. Let's move to (-3.5, 9.5) to avoid obstacles 6 and 7 completely.

Next, we can move horizontally to the right, aiming for the space between obstacle clusters formed by (3, 9, 10) and (4, 5). A suitable waypoint could be (1.5, 9.5).

From (1.5, 9.5), we can safely descend to a point like (1.5, 5.5), staying clear of obstacles 3 and 9. 

Finally, we can move horizontally towards the goal, reaching (5.5, 5.5), which lies within the goal set.

Here's the updated path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5), 
    (-3.5, 9.5), 
    (1.5, 9.5), 
    (1.5, 5.5), 
    (5.5, 5.5)

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

[08/22/2024 09:36:38 AM] The initial path was attempting to take a shorter route but failed to account for obstacles 6 and 3. 

Here's a breakdown of a safer path:

2. **Navigate around obstacle 6:** 
    *  (-3.5, 11) - Move vertically upward, clearing the top of obstacle 6.

3. **Move towards the goal:**
    * (7, 11) - Move horizontally, staying clear of obstacles 10 and 7.

4. **Descend towards the goal area:**
    * (7, 6.5) - Move vertically downward, avoiding obstacle 9.

5. **Reach the goal:**
    * (5.5, 6.5) - Move horizontally to a point within the goal set.

**New Path:**

[08/22/2024 09:36:44 AM] The current path goes directly upward from the start set, colliding with Obstacle 6. To circumvent this, the path needs to initially move right, navigating below Obstacles 6 and 7 before heading upward. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),   # Start within the start set
    (1.0, 6.5),    # Move right, staying below Obstacle 7
    (1.0, 11.0),   # Move upwards, clear of all obstacles
    (7.0, 11.0),   # Move right, staying above all obstacles
    (7.0, 6.5),   # Move down to the level of the goal set
    (5.5, 6.5)    # Move left to end within the goal set 
]
```

]

[08/22/2024 09:36:53 AM] The initial path has intersections with obstacles 3 and 7. To avoid this, we can adjust the path to go around these obstacles. 

1. **Starting Point:** We'll keep the starting point at (-3.5, 6.5).
2. **Avoiding Obstacles 3 and 7:** Instead of directly going towards the goal, we'll first navigate around obstacle 7 by moving upwards to a y-coordinate above the obstacle. We can choose ( -3.5, 9.0) as the next waypoint. Then, to avoid obstacle 3, we'll move rightwards, staying above its y-coordinate range. A suitable waypoint could be (3.0, 9.0).
3. **Approaching the Goal:** Now, we can safely move downwards towards the goal. We'll add a waypoint at (3.0, 6.5) to first align with the goal's y-coordinate. 
4. **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, we can move horizontally towards the goal, reaching the point (5.5, 6.5) within the goal set.

Therefore, the updated path is:

```

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

[08/22/2024 09:37:27 AM] The initial path has multiple intersections with obstacles. Let's analyze the environment and come up with a safer path. 

1. **Starting Point:** (-3.5, 6.5) is fine as it lies within the start set.

2. **Navigating Obstacles 1, 2, 6, and 7:** To avoid these obstacles, we can guide the path upwards, clear of obstacle 6 and 7, then move right, staying above obstacles 1 and 2.

3. **Maneuvering around Obstacle 3:** Obstacle 3 presents a challenge as it forces a path either above or below it. Since our goal lies to the right and at the same y-level as the top of obstacle 3, let's navigate above it.

4. **Reaching the Goal:** From above obstacle 3, it's a clear path to the goal set.

Based on this analysis, here's a possible revised path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),    # Start
    (-3.5, 9.0),    # Move upwards, clearing obstacles 6 & 7
    (1.0, 9.0),     # Move right, staying above obstacles 1 & 2
    (1.0, 8.5),     # Small adjustment to approach obstacle 3 from above
    (3.5, 8.5),     # Navigate above obstacle 3
    (5.5, 6.5)      # Move to a point within the goal set
]
``` 

This path avoids all obstacles and successfully connects the start and goal sets.

    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:37:36 AM] The original path was trying to take a relatively direct route to the goal, but it intersected with obstacles in three segments. To rectify this, the path needs adjustments:

1. **Segment 1 and 2:** The initial path goes almost vertically up from the start position, colliding with obstacle 6. We can circumvent this by first moving slightly right, then upwards, and then left to go around obstacle 6. 
2. **Segment 5:** This segment cuts through obstacles 9 and 10.  We can avoid this by routing the path below obstacle 9. 

Therefore, by adding waypoints to navigate around the obstacles, the path can be made collision-free.

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),   # Start Point
    (-2.5, 6.5),   # Move slightly right to avoid obstacle 7
    (-2.5, 9.5),   # Move up, clearing obstacle 6 
    (1.0, 9.5),    # Move right, staying above obstacle 6
    (1.0, 8.5),    # Move down, preparing to go between obstacles 7 and 9
    (3.5, 8.5),    # Move right, staying below obstacle 9
    (3.5, 5.5),    # Move down, clearing obstacle 9 
    (5.5, 5.5),    # Move right, towards the goal

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

[08/22/2024 09:37:43 AM] The primary issue lies in the path's attempt to navigate between obstacles 6 and 7. Let's adjust the path to circumvent these obstacles effectively.

Instead of directly moving upwards from the start point, let's guide the path to the right, steering clear of obstacle 6.  We can then navigate upwards, avoiding obstacle 3, and proceed towards the goal.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),   # Start point
    (-1.0, 6.5),   # Move right, staying clear of obstacle 6
    (-1.0, 9.5),   # Move upwards, avoiding obstacle 3
    (1.0, 9.5),    # Continue right
    (1.0, 8.5),    # Move down towards the goal
    (3.5, 8.5),    # Continue right
    (3.5, 6.5),    # Move down, avoiding obstacle 9
    (5.5, 6.5)     # Reach the goal area 
]
```

This adjusted path addresses the obstacle collision issues. It ensures a safe passage by maneuvering around obstacles 6, 3, and 9.

[08/22/2024 09:37:49 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate above obstacles 7 and 9, but the chosen waypoints result in intersections. To correct this, we can adjust the path to go below these obstacles instead.

1. **Start to Obstacle 7:** Instead of moving horizontally from the start point, we will move downwards to (-3.5, 4.5) to avoid obstacle 7.

2. **Below Obstacles 7 & 9:** From there, we can move horizontally to the right, passing below obstacles 7 and 9. A suitable waypoint would be (3.5, 4.5).

3. **Reaching the Goal:**  Finally, move upwards from (3.5, 4.5) to (5.5, 6.5) to reach the goal set.

This revised path avoids all obstacles and connects the start and goal sets.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

[08/22/2024 09:38:15 AM] The initial path intersects with obstacles 6 and 10. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around these obstacles. 

1. **Start:** We can keep the starting point at (-3.5, 6.5).
2. **Navigating Obstacles:**  
    - Instead of going straight up, we need to move right to avoid obstacle 6. 
    - A good waypoint would be (-1.5, 6.5), safely clearing obstacle 6. 
    - From here, we can move upwards to (-1.5, 9.5) to clear obstacle 10.
    - Now, we can move right horizontally towards the goal, passing above obstacle 10 with a waypoint at (5.5, 9.5).
3. **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, we can move down to the goal at (5.5, 6.5).

**New Path:**
```

[08/22/2024 09:38:21 AM] The original path was trying to take a relatively direct route, but it intersected with multiple obstacles. We need to find a way around these obstacles.

1. **Starting Point:** We can keep the starting point at (-3.5, 6.5).
2. **Avoiding Obstacles 6 & 7:** Instead of going right immediately, let's move upwards to (-3.5, 10.5) to avoid obstacles 6 and 7. 
3. **Avoiding Obstacle 10:** Now we can move right, safely past obstacle 10, to a point like (6.5, 10.5).
4. **Down to the Goal:** Finally, we can move down to (6.5, 6.5), which is inside the goal set.

Therefore, the new path is:

[08/22/2024 09:38:27 AM] The initial path attempts to go above the obstacles, but the chosen end point is incorrect. It needs to be adjusted to fall within the goal set. Additionally, the path intersects with obstacle 6. 

**Proposed Path:**

1. **Start:** (-3.5, 6.5) - Same as the original path, starting within the start set.

2. **Above Obstacles:** (-3.5, 11.0) -  Move further upward to ensure clear passage above obstacle 6.

3. **Horizontal Traverse:** (6.5, 11.0) - Move horizontally, staying above all obstacles.

4. **Descend to Goal:** (6.5, 6.5) -  Move down to a point within the goal set.

**New Path:**

```

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[6.0, 7.0], [5.0, 7.0], [5.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[-2.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0]]

    Obstacle Avoidance (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
		Segment 1 between points (-3.5, 6.5) and (-3.5, 11.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 6: [[-2.0, 10.0], [-4.0, 10.0], [-4.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 8.0]]
    End set: Incorrect, The path does not end inside the goal set [[6.0, 7.0], [5.0, 7.0], [5.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0]].

    Goal Position: End within the specified rectangular goal set.
Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:38:35 AM] The initial path goes too far up and misses the goal set.  We need to adjust it to go through the gap between obstacles 7 and 9, then turn right towards the goal.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),   # Start within the start set
    (-3.5, 7.5),   # Move up, staying clear of obstacle 7
    (1.5, 7.5),    # Move right, navigating between obstacles 7 and 9
    (5.5, 7.5),    # Move right towards the goal set
    (5.5, 6.5)     # Move down into the goal set
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Starting Point:**  We keep the same starting point within the start set.
2. **Upward Adjustment:** We move slightly upward to (-3.5, 7.5) to ensure clearance from obstacle 7. 
3. **Navigating the Gap:** We move right to (1.5, 7.5), passing through the gap between obstacles 7 and 9. 
4. **Approaching the Goal:** Continue moving right to (5.5, 7.5), aligning with the goal set.
5. **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, we move down to (5.5, 6.5), placing the final point within the goal set.

[08/22/2024 09:38:44 AM] The initial path was trying to take a straight line, but collided with obstacles. I'll adjust it to go around obstacles 3 and 7 by going above them, and then navigate around obstacle 9.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),   # Start
    (-3.5, 9.0),   # Move up to clear obstacles 3 & 7
    (1.5, 9.0),    # Move right, still above obstacles
    (1.5, 7.5),    # Move down to the level of the goal
    (5.5, 7.5),    # Move right to the goal
    (5.5, 6.5)     # End 
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(-3.5, 6.5) to (-3.5, 9.0):**  Move vertically upwards to a point clearly above obstacles 3 and 7. 
2. **(-3.5, 9.0) to (1.5, 9.0):** Move horizontally rightwards, staying above obstacles 3 & 7.
3. **(1.5, 9.0) to (1.5, 7.5):**  Move vertically downwards to align with the height of the goal, ensuring we are clear of obstacle 9.
4. **(1.5, 7.5) to (5.5, 7.5):** Move horizontally rightwards towards the goal.
5. **(5.5, 7.5) to (5.5, 6.5):** Finally, move down into the goal area. 

This path avoids all obstacles by taking a safer route above the cluttered area.

[08/22/2024 09:38:52 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate above obstacles 6 and 7, but the chosen waypoints result in collisions. Similarly, the path segment between obstacles 3 and 9 intersects obstacle 9. To rectify this, the path needs adjustments:

1. **Navigate between Obstacles 6 and 7:** Instead of going directly above obstacle 6, the path can be modified to pass between obstacles 6 and 7. 

2. **Navigate between Obstacles 3 and 9:**  To avoid the intersection with obstacle 9, the path should pass below it.

Therefore, the adjusted path will first move to a point below obstacle 7, then proceed rightwards, passing below obstacle 9, and finally reach the goal set.

Here's the modified path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),   # Start within the start set
    (-3.5, 5.5),   # Move down to a point below obstacle 7
    (1.5, 5.5),    # Move rightwards, staying below obstacles 7 and 9
    (5.5, 5.5),    # Move rightwards to a point within the goal set
    (5.5, 6.5)     # End within the goal set 
]
```
