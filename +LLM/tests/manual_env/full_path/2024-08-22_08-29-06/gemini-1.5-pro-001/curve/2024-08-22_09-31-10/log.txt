# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements

[08/22/2024 09:31:19 AM] The original path goes through several obstacles as it attempts to take a straight line to the goal. To correct this, we can route the path around the obstacles. 

Starting within the start set, we can choose the point (-3.5, 6.5). From there, we can move to the point (0.0, 6.5) to clear the leftmost obstacles. Then, moving to (0.0, 9.0) allows us to clear obstacles 6 and 7. Moving right to (5.5, 9.0) and then down to (5.5, 6.5) allows us to reach the goal set while avoiding the remaining obstacles. 

Here is the corrected path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5), 
    (0.0, 6.5), 
    (0.0, 9.0),

[08/22/2024 09:31:28 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate above obstacles 1 and 2 and below obstacles 6 and 7. However, it intersects with obstacles 3, 7, and 10. 

To rectify this, we can adjust the path as follows:

1. **Navigate below Obstacle 3 and 7:** Instead of attempting to go above, let's guide the path below these obstacles.
2. **Maintain Clearance from Obstacle 2:** Ensure the path stays clear of Obstacle 2 while moving towards the goal.
3. **Bypass Obstacle 10:**  The path needs to navigate around Obstacle 10 to reach the goal set. We can achieve this by routing the path below it. 

Considering these adjustments, a possible revised path is:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),   # Start within the start set
    (-3.5, 5.0),   # Move down, staying clear of Obstacle 7
    (1.0, 5.0),    # Move right, passing below Obstacle 3
    (1.0, 3.0),    # Move down, maintaining clearance from Obstacle 2
    (5.5, 3.0),    # Move right, staying below Obstacle 10 
    (5.5, 6.5)     # Move up to end within the goal set
]
```

This path aims to avoid all obstacles while reaching the goal.  Remember to visually verify if this new path successfully avoids all obstacles based on the provided coordinates.

]

[08/22/2024 09:31:38 AM] The initial path went through obstacles 3 and 5. To fix this, the path needs to navigate around these obstacles. 

1. **Starting Point:**  (-3.5, 6.5) - No change, it's within the start set.

2. **Navigate Below Obstacle 3:** Instead of moving directly towards the goal,  we need to go below Obstacle 3.  A good waypoint would be (-3.5, 4.0)

3. **Avoid Obstacle 2:**  Moving horizontally at a y-value of 4.0 would cause a collision with Obstacle 2.  So, we need to move further down, to a y-value of 0.  A suitable waypoint would be (-3.5, 0.0)

4. **Clear Obstacle 2:** Now we can move horizontally to the right,  bypassing obstacle 2. A suitable waypoint would be (1.0, 0.0).

5. **Navigate Above Obstacles 4 & 5:** Before heading towards the goal, we need to move upwards to avoid Obstacles 4 and 5. A good waypoint would be (1.0, 4.0).

6. **Approach the Goal:** Now clear of the obstacles, we can move horizontally towards the goal. A suitable waypoint would be (5.5, 4.0).

7. **Endpoint:** Finally, move up to reach the goal set: (5.5, 6.5).

[08/22/2024 09:31:44 AM] The provided path goes right through the obstacles, so a new approach needs to be taken. Looking at the obstacles, a path that travels around the obstacles, staying close to the top edge of the environment, seems possible. 

Starting at (-3.5, 6.5), move horizontally to the left, staying close to the top edge, until a point past the obstacles 6 and 7 is reached. Then move downwards to a point with a y-value of 4.  From there, move horizontally to the right until reaching the goal set. This strategy avoids all obstacles while maintaining a clear path from start to finish.

[08/22/2024 09:31:50 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 3. To do this, we can route the path below Obstacle 3.

1. **Original problematic segment:** The segment connecting  (-4.5, 4.0) and (5.5, 4.0) directly cuts through Obstacle 3.
2. **Identifying a safe passage:**  There's ample space below Obstacle 3 to navigate around it.
3. **Adjusting the path:** We can modify the path to go downwards, pass under Obstacle 3, and then move towards the goal.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5), 
    (-4.5, 6.5), 
    (-4.5, 4.0),

[08/22/2024 09:31:57 AM] The path needs to navigate above obstacles 1 and 8 and between obstacles 5 and 4. The previous path failed because it tried to go directly between these obstacles at y = 2.0. 

Here's a possible fix:

1. **Starting Point:** We'll keep the starting point at (-3.5, 6.5).
2. **Navigate Above Obstacles:** Instead of going down to y = 2.0, we'll guide the path above obstacles 1 and 8.  A good waypoint for this is (-4.5, 4.5). 
3. **Go Between Obstacles:** From there, we can move towards the goal, passing safely between obstacles 5 and 4. A waypoint like (1.0, 4.5) will work.
4. **Reach the Goal:** Finally, we can proceed to the goal set at (5.5, 6.5).

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5), 
    (-4.5, 4.5),

[08/22/2024 09:32:17 AM] The initial path has collisions because it tries to go 'through' obstacle 3. To fix this, we need to route the path around obstacle 3. One way to do this is to go above it. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),   # Start within the start set
    (-4.5, 9.5),   # Move upwards to clear obstacle 3 and other upper obstacles 
    (1.0, 9.5),    # Move rightwards, staying above obstacle 3 and others
    (5.5, 6.5)    # Move downwards to the goal set
] 
```

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Identify Collision:** The feedback indicates that the original path segments intersect with obstacle 3. 
2. **Analyze Obstacle:** Obstacle 3 is positioned in the middle of the environment, requiring the path to either go above or below it.
3. **Choose a Direction:**  Going above seems more straightforward in this case as it aligns with reaching the goal position.
4. **Determine Waypoints:** 
   - The first waypoint remains unchanged as it's within the start set. 
   - Add a waypoint to move significantly upward, clearing obstacle 3 and potential upper obstacles (-4.5, 9.5).
   - Add another waypoint to move rightward, staying above obstacle 3 (1.0, 9.5).
   - Keep the final waypoint to ensure the path ends within the goal set. 

This adjusted path avoids obstacle 3 by going around it, ensuring a collision-free path.

[08/22/2024 09:32:24 AM] The initial path has intersections with obstacles 6 and 9. To fix this, we can adjust the path to go around these obstacles.

2. **Avoiding Obstacle 6:** Instead of going directly to (-4.5, 9.5), we can navigate below Obstacle 6. A waypoint at (-4.5, 7.5) would achieve this.
3. **Continuing Right:** From (-4.5, 7.5), we can move right towards the goal, setting a waypoint at (1.0, 7.5).

[08/22/2024 09:32:37 AM] The original path attempts to navigate straight down, through the center, and then straight up again. This approach fails due to the central obstacles. A more successful strategy involves navigating around these obstacles. Let's try going around obstacles 1 and 2 by moving right and upwards, then going left above obstacles 6 and 7, and finally approaching the goal from the top.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),   # Start point within the start set.
    (-3.5, 5.5),   # Move slightly down to avoid potential intersection with obstacle 7. 
    (1.5, 5.5),    # Move right, staying clear of obstacle 7.
    (1.5, 9.5),    # Move upwards, going above obstacles 6 and 7.
    (5.5, 9.5),    # Move right, staying above obstacle 10.
    (5.5, 6.5)     # Move down into the goal set.
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles:

* It navigates around the right side of obstacles 1 and 2.
* It then moves upwards, safely clearing obstacles 6 and 7.
* Finally, it approaches the goal set from above, avoiding obstacle 10.

[08/22/2024 09:32:46 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate directly from the start to the goal set. However, it runs into multiple obstacles. 

1. **Segment 2 & 3:** The path intersects with Obstacle 3 because it tries to pass directly through the narrow gap between its vertices. 
2. **Segment 4 & 5:** The path intersects with Obstacle 10 for the same reason as above.

To correct the path, we need to navigate around these obstacles:

* **Avoiding Obstacle 3:** Instead of going directly right, we can first move upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 3, then proceed right towards the goal.
* **Avoiding Obstacle 10:** Similar to Obstacle 3, we can navigate around Obstacle 10 by moving upwards before reaching it, then continuing to the goal.

Therefore, the adjusted path should look something like this:

1. **Start:** (-3.5, 6.5)
2. **Move up:** (-3.5, 9.5) - This avoids Obstacle 3 and 7.
3. **Move right:** (1.5, 9.5) - This stays clear of Obstacle 6.
4. **Move right, towards the goal:** (5.5, 9.5) - This avoids Obstacles 9 and 10.
5. **Move down to the goal:** (5.5, 6.5)

## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[6.0, 7.0], [5.0, 7.0], [5.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[-2.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0], [-2.0, -1.0], [0.0, -1.0]]

			Obstacle 10: [[6.0, 10.0], [4.0, 10.0], [4.0, 8.0], [6.0, 8.0]]

    
## Your generated path:
    path = [(-3.5, 6.5), (-3.5, 9.5), (1.5, 9.5), (5.5, 9.5), (5.5, 6.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    Obstacle Avoidance (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
		Segment 1 between points (-3.5, 6.5) and (-3.5, 9.5) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 6: [[-2.0, 10.0], [-4.0, 10.0], [-4.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 8.0]]
		Segment 2 between points (-3.5, 9.5) and (1.5, 9.5) intersects with obstacle(s):
			Obstacle 6: [[-2.0, 10.0], [-4.0, 10.0], [-4.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 8.0]]

			Obstacle 10: [[6.0, 10.0], [4.0, 10.0], [4.0, 8.0], [6.0, 8.0]]
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:32:54 AM] The original path goes above obstacles 6 and 10 which causes collisions.  The path needs to be adjusted to go below these obstacles.

1. **Start:** (-3.5, 6.5) - This is a good starting point within the start set.

2. **Navigate below Obstacle 6:** Instead of moving up, we should move down to avoid Obstacle 6. A good waypoint would be (-3.5, 5.5), as it stays clear of Obstacle 7.

3. **Navigate between Obstacles:** From (-3.5, 5.5), we can move rightwards, staying below Obstacle 7 and to the left of Obstacle 3. A waypoint at (1.5, 5.5) would work.

4. **Navigate below Obstacle 10:** To avoid Obstacle 10, we need to stay below it. Let's aim for a waypoint at (5.5, 5.5), which is to the right of Obstacle 9 and below Obstacle 10.

5. **Reach Goal:** Finally, move up from (5.5, 5.5) to (5.5, 6.5) to end within the goal set.

Therefore, the corrected path is:
```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5), 
    (-3.5, 5.5), 
    (1.5, 5.5),
    (5.5, 5.5),
    (5.5, 6.5)
]
```

    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data

[08/22/2024 09:33:32 AM] The initial path was attempting to directly cross the space between the top clusters of obstacles. It needs to navigate a bit more cautiously. 

Here's a possible path considering the obstacles:

1. **Start:** (-3.5, 6.5) - Same as before, safely within the start zone.
2. **Downwards:** (-3.5, 5.5) - Move down, staying clear of obstacles 6 and 7.
3. **Rightwards:** (1.0, 5.5)  - Move right, passing below obstacle 3 and above obstacles 7 and 9.
4. **Upwards:** (1.0, 7.5)  - Move up, clearing obstacles 9 and 10. 
5. **Rightwards:** (5.5, 7.5) - Move right, now above all obstacles and approaching the goal.
6. **Downwards:** (5.5, 6.5) - Move down into the goal zone.

[08/22/2024 09:33:46 AM] The initial path attempts to navigate above obstacles 6 and 3 but fails. 
To correct this, the path should be adjusted to move between obstacles strategically. 

1. **Starting Point:** (-3.5, 6.5) is appropriate.

2. **Navigating Obstacles:**
    - Instead of going straight up, the path should initially move right, aiming for the space between Obstacles 3 and 7. 
    - A waypoint around (0.0, 6.5) seems suitable.

3. **Reaching the Goal:**
    - From (0.0, 6.5), the path can safely move right, bypassing Obstacle 9.

    - Finally, the path can proceed to the goal area.

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/22/2024 09:33:53 AM] The initial path attempted to go directly across from the start to the goal set at a y-coordinate of 6.5. However, this path intersected with multiple obstacles. 

To avoid these obstacles, the path needs to navigate around them. One possible solution is to dip below the obstacles before proceeding towards the goal:

1. **Start:** (-3.5, 6.5) - Same as before, starting inside the start set.
2. **Dip Down:** (-3.5, 4.5) - Move downwards, clearing Obstacles 3 and 7.
3. **Move Right:** (2.5, 4.5) - Move right, staying below Obstacles 3, 7 and 9.
4. **Move Up:** (2.5, 6.5) - Move upwards, clearing Obstacle 9.
5. **Reach Goal:** (5.5, 6.5) - Move right, reaching the goal set.

Therefore, the new path is:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5), 
    (-3.5, 4.5), 
    (2.5, 4.5), 
    (2.5, 6.5),

]

[08/22/2024 09:34:20 AM] The original path attempts to navigate directly from the start to the goal area. However, several obstacles block this direct route. To correct the path:

1. **Starting Point:** We'll maintain the starting point of (-3.5, 6.5).

2. **Navigating Obstacles:**  
    * The initial path segment crosses obstacles 3 and 7. To avoid this, we need to direct the path upwards, clear of obstacle 7, before moving horizontally.
    * A new waypoint at (-3.5, 9.5) achieves this.
    * Next, we need to navigate around obstacle 10. Adding a waypoint at (1.0, 9.5) allows the path to move horizontally, clear of obstacle 10. 

3. **Reaching the Goal:**
    * From (1.0, 9.5), the path can move directly downwards to the goal area without intersecting any obstacles.
    * A final waypoint can be placed at (5.5, 6.5), residing within the goal set.

Therefore, the corrected path is:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  # Start
    (-3.5, 9.5),  # Move upwards to clear obstacle 7
    (1.0, 9.5),   # Move rightwards, above obstacle 10
    (5.5, 6.5)    # Move downwards into the goal set
