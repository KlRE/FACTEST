# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements

[09/09/2024 06:52:23 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I've analyzed the environment and devised a path that meets the criteria. Here's the path represented as an array of waypoints:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (0.8, 0.5),    # Move slightly right to avoid Obstacle 1
    (0.8, 9.5),    # Move up above all obstacles
    (9.0, 9.5),    # Move right, staying above obstacles
    (9.0, 1.0),    # Move down, avoiding Obstacle 9
    (9.5, 1.0),    # Move right towards the goal set
    (9.5, 0.6)     # End within the goal set
]

Explanation of the path:
1. The path starts at (0.5, 0.5), which is within the start set.
2. It moves slightly right to avoid Obstacle 1.
3. Then it moves upward to a height of 9.5, which is above all obstacles.
4. The path then moves right across the top of the environment.
5. Once past all major vertical obstacles, it moves down to a height of 1.0, avoiding Obstacle 9.
6. It then moves right towards the goal area.
7. Finally, it moves down slightly to end at (9.5, 0.6), which is within the goal set.

This path successfully avoids all obstacles while maintaining a safe distance from them. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set as required.

[09/09/2024 06:52:33 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issue is with the path going too high (y=9.5), intersecting with several vertical obstacles.
3. We need to find a lower route that avoids the vertical obstacles.
4. There appears to be a gap between the bottom of most vertical obstacles and the ground.
5. The horizontal obstacles near the goal require careful navigation.

Let's plan a new path:

1. Start from (0.5, 0.5) in the start set.
2. Move right to (0.8, 0.5) to clear the first obstacle.
3. Instead of going up, we'll go right to (1.3, 0.5) to pass the first vertical obstacle.
4. Move up slightly to (1.3, 0.7) to avoid any potential rounding issues.
5. Continue right to (2.5, 0.7) to pass the second vertical obstacle.
6. Move right to (3.7, 0.7) to pass the third vertical obstacle.
7. Continue to (4.9, 0.7) to pass the fourth vertical obstacle.
8. Move to (6.1, 0.7) to pass the fifth and sixth vertical obstacles.
9. Continue to (7.3, 0.7) to pass the seventh vertical obstacle.
10. Move to (8.1, 0.7) to approach the final vertical obstacle.
11. Go up to (8.1, 3.3) to position below the lowest horizontal obstacle.
12. Move right to (9.1, 3.3) to pass the final vertical obstacle.
13. Go up to (9.1, 4.0) to position between horizontal obstacles.
14. Move right to (9.5, 4.0) to approach the goal set.
15. Finally, move up to (9.5, 0.6) to enter the goal set.

This path should avoid all obstacles while maintaining a safe distance from them. It utilizes the gap at the bottom of the environment and carefully navigates the horizontal obstacles near the goal.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (0.8, 0.5),
    (1.3, 0.5),
    (1.3, 0.7),

    (9.1, 3.3),
    (9.1, 4.0),
    (9.5, 4.0),

]

This path should meet all the requirements: starting in the start set, ending in the goal set, and avoiding all obstacles with a safe margin.

[09/09/2024 06:52:43 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the path and make the necessary adjustments to avoid intersecting with obstacles while ensuring the path starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.

Analysis and Thought Process:

1. Start point: The current start point (0.5, 0.5) is within the start set, so we can keep it.

2. Obstacle 1: We need to avoid crossing this obstacle. We can move to the right of it by going to (1.3, 0.5).

3. Obstacle 2: To avoid this obstacle, we need to go further right. We can move to (2.5, 0.5).

4. Obstacle 4: We need to go around this obstacle. We can move to (3.7, 0.5).

5. Obstacle 5: This obstacle starts at y=1.0, so we can safely pass under it.

6. Obstacle 6: We need to go around this obstacle. We can move to (6.1, 0.5).

7. Obstacle 8: This obstacle starts at y=1.0, so we can safely pass under it.

9. Obstacle 9: We need to go around this obstacle. We can move to (8.5, 0.5).

10. Obstacles 10-15: These obstacles create a zig-zag pattern. We need to navigate through them carefully.

11. Goal set: We need to end within the goal set, which is between x=9.3 and x=9.7, and between y=0.4 and y=0.8.

Based on this analysis, here's the new path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point
    (1.3, 0.5),    # Right of Obstacle 1
    (2.5, 0.5),    # Right of Obstacle 2
    (3.7, 0.5),    # Right of Obstacle 4
    (4.9, 0.5),    # Under Obstacle 5
    (6.1, 0.5),    # Right of Obstacle 6
    (7.3, 0.5),    # Under Obstacle 8
    (8.5, 0.5),    # Right of Obstacle 9
    (8.5, 3.3),    # Move up to navigate zig-zag
    (9.1, 3.3),    # Move right
    (9.1, 4.5),    # Move up
    (9.5, 4.5),    # Move right
    (9.5, 2.7),    # Move down
    (9.5, 0.6)     # End point within goal set
]

This path should avoid all obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. The zig-zag movement at the end helps navigate through the horizontal obstacles near the goal set.

[09/09/2024 06:52:54 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. Let's analyze the environment and create a new path that avoids all obstacles.

Analysis:
1. The start and end positions are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issue is that our path is intersecting with several vertical obstacles and one horizontal obstacle.
3. We need to create a path that zigzags between the vertical obstacles while maintaining a safe distance.
4. We should also adjust the vertical position of our path to avoid the horizontal obstacles near the goal.

Let's create a new path:

1. Start point: We'll keep (0.5, 0.5) as it's within the start set.
2. To avoid Obstacle 1, we'll move up to y=0.7 and then right to x=1.3.
3. We'll continue this pattern of moving up and right to avoid each vertical obstacle.
4. Near the goal, we'll navigate around the horizontal obstacles.

New path with explanation:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start point
    (0.5, 0.7),   # Move up to avoid Obstacle 1
    (1.3, 0.7),   # Move right past Obstacle 1
    (1.3, 0.9),   # Move up to avoid Obstacle 2
    (2.5, 0.9),   # Move right past Obstacle 2
    (2.5, 0.7),   # Move down slightly
    (3.7, 0.7),   # Move right past Obstacle 4
    (3.7, 0.9),   # Move up to avoid Obstacle 5
    (4.9, 0.9),   # Move right past Obstacle 5
    (4.9, 0.7),   # Move down slightly
    (6.1, 0.7),   # Move right past Obstacle 6
    (6.1, 0.9),   # Move up to avoid Obstacle 8
    (7.3, 0.9),   # Move right past Obstacle 8
    (7.3, 0.7),   # Move down slightly
    (8.1, 0.7),   # Move right, staying clear of Obstacle 9
    (8.1, 3.3),   # Move up, avoiding Obstacle 14
    (8.7, 3.3),   # Move right, staying between Obstacles 14 and 15
    (8.7, 4.5),   # Move up, avoiding Obstacle 13
    (9.1, 4.5),   # Move right, staying between Obstacles 13 and 11
    (9.1, 5.7),   # Move up, avoiding Obstacle 12
    (9.5, 5.7),   # Move right, staying between Obstacles 12 and 10
    (9.5, 0.6)    # Move down to the goal set
]

This path should avoid all obstacles while maintaining a safe distance. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set. The zigzag pattern allows it to navigate between the vertical obstacles, and the careful maneuvering near the end helps it avoid the horizontal obstacles near the goal.

[09/09/2024 06:53:09 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback. I'll analyze the path and make the necessary adjustments to avoid the obstacles. Let's go through the problematic segments and correct them:

1. Start to Obstacle 1:
The path needs to avoid Obstacle 1 (1.0-1.2 on x-axis). We'll move the path to go around it.

2. Between Obstacles 1 and 2:
We need to adjust the path to pass between these obstacles without touching them.

3. Between Obstacles 2 and 4:
Similar adjustment needed to pass safely between these obstacles.

4. Between Obstacles 4 and 5:
We'll adjust the path to pass below Obstacle 5.

5. Between Obstacles 5 and 6:
The path needs to be adjusted to pass between these obstacles.

6. Between Obstacles 6 and 8:
We'll modify the path to go below Obstacle 8.

7. Navigating through the right side:
Instead of going up and down between the horizontal obstacles on the right side, we'll plan a smoother path that avoids all these obstacles.

Considering these adjustments, here's the new path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point
    (0.8, 0.5),    # Move right, staying below Obstacle 1
    (0.8, 0.1),    # Move down to safely pass under Obstacle 1
    (1.4, 0.1),    # Move right, past Obstacle 1
    (1.4, 0.5),    # Move up to prepare for passing between Obstacles 1 and 2
    (2.1, 0.5),    # Move right, staying between Obstacles 1 and 2
    (2.1, 0.1),    # Move down to pass under Obstacle 2
    (2.6, 0.1),    # Move right, past Obstacle 2
    (2.6, 0.5),    # Move up to prepare for passing between Obstacles 2 and 4
    (3.3, 0.5),    # Move right, staying between Obstacles 2 and 4
    (3.3, 0.1),    # Move down to pass under Obstacle 4
    (3.8, 0.1),    # Move right, past Obstacle 4
    (3.8, 0.8),    # Move up, but stay below Obstacle 5
    (4.5, 0.8),    # Move right, staying below Obstacle 5
    (4.5, 0.1),    # Move down to prepare for passing between Obstacles 5 and 6
    (5.6, 0.1),    # Move right, staying between Obstacles 5 and 6
    (5.6, 0.8),    # Move up, but stay below Obstacle 7
    (6.2, 0.8),    # Move right, staying below Obstacle 8
    (6.2, 0.1),    # Move down to safely pass under Obstacle 8
    (7.4, 0.1),    # Move right, past Obstacle 8
    (7.4, 0.8),    # Move up, preparing to navigate through the right side
    (8.0, 0.8),    # Move right, staying below Obstacle 9
    (8.0, 1.2),    # Move up slightly to avoid Obstacle 9
    (8.6, 1.2),    # Move right, between Obstacles 9 and 14
    (8.6, 2.1),    # Move up, staying between Obstacles 9 and 14
    (9.1, 2.1),    # Move right, between Obstacles 14 and 15
    (9.1, 3.3),    # Move up, staying between Obstacles 14 and 13
    (9.5, 3.3),    # Move right, between Obstacles 13 and 12
    (9.5, 0.6)     # Move down to the goal set
]

This new path should avoid all obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. It takes a more careful approach, moving around obstacles with more waypoints to ensure a safe passage.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

[09/09/2024 06:53:24 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the path and make the necessary adjustments to avoid intersecting with obstacles. Let's go through the problematic segments and adjust the path accordingly.

1. Start point: The start point (0.5, 0.5) is correct and within the start set.

2. Segment intersecting Obstacle 1: We need to avoid the intersection between (0.8, 0.1) and (1.4, 0.1). We can do this by going around the obstacle.

3. Segment intersecting Obstacle 2: We need to avoid the intersection between (2.1, 0.1) and (2.6, 0.1). We'll adjust the path to go around this obstacle.

4. Segment intersecting Obstacle 4: We need to avoid the intersection between (3.3, 0.1) and (3.8, 0.1). We'll modify the path to go around this obstacle.

5. Segment intersecting Obstacle 6: We need to avoid the intersection between (5.6, 0.8) and (6.2, 0.8). We'll adjust the path to go around this obstacle.

6. Segment intersecting Obstacle 9: We need to avoid the intersection between (8.0, 1.2) and (8.6, 1.2). We'll modify the path to go around this obstacle.

7. Segment intersecting Obstacle 15: We need to avoid the intersection between (9.5, 3.3) and (9.5, 0.6). We'll adjust the final approach to the goal set to avoid this obstacle.

8. End point: We'll ensure the end point is within the goal set.

Considering these adjustments, here's the new path with explanations:

[09/09/2024 06:53:39 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the path and make the necessary adjustments to avoid obstacles while maintaining the start and end points within their respective sets.

Analysis and Thought Process:

1. Start point (0.5, 0.5) is correct and within the start set.

2. The path needs adjustments to avoid intersecting with obstacles:

   a. Obstacle 1 (1.0 to 1.2 on x-axis): We need to go around it.
   b. Obstacle 2 (2.2 to 2.4 on x-axis): Another adjustment needed.
   c. Obstacle 4 (3.4 to 3.6 on x-axis): We'll need to bypass this one too.
   d. Obstacle 6 (5.8 to 6.0 on x-axis): Requires a detour.
   e. Obstacle 9 (8.2 to 8.4 on x-axis): Need to avoid this one.
   f. Obstacle 15 (9.3 to 10.0 on x-axis, 2.3 to 2.5 on y-axis): Final obstacle to navigate around.

3. The end point (9.5, 0.6) is correct and within the goal set.

4. We'll maintain a safe distance of at least 0.1 units from all obstacles.

5. The path will generally move from left to right, making necessary vertical adjustments to avoid obstacles.

Based on this analysis, here's the adjusted path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),     # Start point
    (0.9, 0.5),     # Approach Obstacle 1
    (0.9, 0.2),     # Move down to go under Obstacle 1
    (1.3, 0.2),     # Clear Obstacle 1
    (1.3, 0.5),     # Move up to prepare for Obstacle 2
    (2.1, 0.5),     # Approach Obstacle 2
    (2.1, 0.2),     # Move down to go under Obstacle 2

    (3.3, 0.5),     # Approach Obstacle 4

[09/09/2024 06:53:53 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the path and make the necessary corrections to avoid intersecting with obstacles while maintaining the start and end points within their respective sets.

Analysis and Corrections:

1. Start point (0.5, 0.5) is correct and within the start set.

2. The path between (0.9, 0.2) and (1.3, 0.2) intersects Obstacle 1. To avoid this, we'll go around the obstacle:
   - Add a point (0.9, 0.5) to stay above the obstacle
   - Add a point (1.3, 0.5) to pass the obstacle

3. The segment between (2.1, 0.2) and (2.5, 0.2) intersects Obstacle 2. We'll adjust:
   - Change (2.1, 0.2) to (2.1, 0.5)
   - Change (2.5, 0.2) to (2.5, 0.5)

4. For the intersection with Obstacle 4, we'll adjust:
   - Change (3.3, 0.2) to (3.3, 0.5)
   - Change (3.7, 0.2) to (3.7, 0.5)

5. To avoid Obstacle 6, we'll modify:
   - Change (5.7, 0.2) to (5.7, 0.5)
   - Change (6.1, 0.2) to (6.1, 0.5)

6. For the intersection with Obstacle 9, we'll adjust:
   - Change (8.1, 1.1) to (8.1, 1.2)
   - Change (8.5, 1.1) to (8.5, 1.2)

7. To avoid Obstacle 15, we'll modify the approach to the goal:
   - Remove the point (9.5, 2.7)
   - Add points to navigate around the obstacles: (9.1, 2.7), (9.1, 2.1), (9.5, 2.1)

8. The end point (9.5, 0.6) is correct and within the goal set.

New path considering these adjustments:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (0.9, 0.5),
    (1.3, 0.5),
    (2.1, 0.5),
    (2.5, 0.5),
    (3.3, 0.5),
    (3.7, 0.5),
    (3.7, 0.8),
    (4.5, 0.8),
    (5.7, 0.8),
    (5.7, 0.5),
    (6.1, 0.5),
    (6.1, 0.8),
    (7.3, 0.8),
    (8.1, 1.2),
    (8.5, 1.2),
    (8.5, 2.0),
    (9.1, 2.0),
    (9.1, 2.7),
    (9.1, 2.1),
    (9.5, 2.1),
    (9.5, 0.6)
]

This new path should avoid all obstacles while maintaining the start and end points within their respective sets. The path now takes a more careful approach around each obstacle, ensuring a safe distance is maintained throughout the journey.

[09/09/2024 06:54:05 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and example. I'll analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and adjust the path accordingly.

Analysis and Thought Process:

1. Start point: The current start point (0.5, 0.5) is valid and within the start set.

2. Obstacle 1: We need to avoid crossing through (1.0, 0.5) to (1.3, 0.5). We can go around this obstacle by moving up slightly before moving right.

3. Obstacle 2: We need to avoid crossing through (2.1, 0.5) to (2.5, 0.5). We can go further up to avoid this obstacle.

4. Obstacle 4: We need to avoid crossing through (3.3, 0.5) to (3.7, 0.5). We can maintain our higher y-coordinate to avoid this obstacle.

5. Obstacle 6: We need to avoid crossing through (5.7, 0.5) to (6.1, 0.5). We can maintain our current path to avoid this obstacle.

6. Obstacle 9: We need to avoid crossing through (8.1, 1.2) to (8.5, 1.2). We can go around this obstacle by moving up slightly before proceeding.

7. Goal point: The current end point (9.5, 0.6) is valid and within the goal set.

Based on this analysis, here's the adjusted path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point
    (0.9, 0.5),    # Move right, staying below Obstacle 1
    (0.9, 1.0),    # Move up to avoid Obstacle 1
    (1.3, 1.0),    # Move right, clearing Obstacle 1
    (1.3, 1.5),    # Move up to avoid Obstacle 2
    (2.5, 1.5),    # Move right, clearing Obstacle 2
    (2.5, 1.0),    # Move down slightly
    (3.3, 1.0),    # Move right
    (3.3, 1.5),    # Move up to avoid Obstacle 4
    (3.7, 1.5),    # Move right, clearing Obstacle 4
    (3.7, 0.8),    # Move down slightly
    (4.5, 0.8),    # Move right
    (5.7, 0.8),    # Continue right
    (6.1, 0.8),    # Clear Obstacle 6
    (7.3, 0.8),    # Continue right
    (8.1, 0.8),    # Approach Obstacle 9
    (8.1, 1.5),    # Move up to avoid Obstacle 9
    (8.5, 1.5),    # Move right, clearing Obstacle 9
    (8.5, 2.0),    # Move up slightly
    (9.1, 2.0),    # Move right
    (9.1, 0.6),    # Move down towards the goal set
    (9.5, 0.6)     # End point within the goal set

[09/09/2024 06:54:17 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the path and make the necessary corrections to avoid intersecting with obstacles while maintaining the start and end points within their respective sets.

Analysis and Thought Process:

1. Start point: The current start point (0.5, 0.5) is valid and within the start set.

2. Obstacle 1: The path intersects with Obstacle 1 between (0.9, 1.0) and (1.3, 1.0). We need to go around this obstacle.

3. Obstacle 2: The path intersects with Obstacle 2 between (1.3, 1.5) and (2.5, 1.5). We need to adjust this segment.

4. Obstacle 4: The path intersects with Obstacle 4 between (3.3, 1.5) and (3.7, 1.5). We'll need to go around this obstacle.

5. Obstacle 6: The path intersects with Obstacle 6 between (5.7, 0.8) and (6.1, 0.8). We'll adjust this segment.

6. Obstacle 9: The path intersects with Obstacle 9 between (8.1, 1.5) and (8.5, 1.5). We'll need to go around this obstacle.

7. End point: The current end point (9.5, 0.6) is valid and within the goal set.

Corrections:

1. To avoid Obstacle 1, we'll go around it by moving up to y=1.5 before moving right.

2. For Obstacle 2, we'll move the path to y=1.8 to clear it safely.

3. To avoid Obstacle 4, we'll go around it by moving to y=1.8 before proceeding.

4. For Obstacle 6, we'll slightly adjust the y-coordinate to 0.7 to avoid intersection.

5. To clear Obstacle 9, we'll move the path to y=1.2 before proceeding to the goal.

New Path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start point
    (0.5, 1.5),  # Move up to clear Obstacle 1
    (1.3, 1.5),  # Move right
    (1.3, 1.8),  # Move up to clear Obstacle 2
    (2.5, 1.8),  # Move right
    (3.3, 1.8),  # Continue right
    (3.7, 1.8),  # Clear Obstacle 4
    (3.7, 0.7),  # Move down
    (5.7, 0.7),  # Move right
    (6.1, 0.7),  # Clear Obstacle 6
    (7.3, 0.7),  # Continue right
    (8.1, 0.7),  # Continue right
    (8.1, 1.2),  # Move up to clear Obstacle 9
    (8.5, 1.2),  # Move right
    (9.1, 1.2),  # Continue right
    (9.1, 0.6),  # Move down towards goal
    (9.5, 0.6)   # End point
]

This new path should avoid all obstacles while maintaining the start and end points within their respective sets. The path has been adjusted to keep a safe distance from all obstacles, ensuring no intersections occur.

[09/09/2024 06:54:28 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and example. I'll analyze the path and make corrections to avoid intersecting with obstacles while maintaining the start and end points within their respective sets.

Analysis and Corrections:

1. Start point (0.5, 0.5) is valid and within the start set.

2. The path intersects Obstacle 1 between (0.5, 1.5) and (1.3, 1.5). To avoid this, we'll go around the obstacle:
   - Move to (0.9, 1.5) to stay clear of Obstacle 1
   - Then to (0.9, 9.1) to go above Obstacle 1

3. The path intersects Obstacle 2 between (1.3, 1.8) and (2.5, 1.8). We'll adjust:
   - From (0.9, 9.1) to (2.5, 9.1) to stay above Obstacles 1 and 2

4. The path intersects Obstacle 4 between (3.3, 1.8) and (3.7, 1.8). We'll modify:
   - From (2.5, 9.1) to (3.7, 9.1) to stay above Obstacles 3 and 4

5. The path intersects Obstacle 6 between (5.7, 0.7) and (6.1, 0.7). We'll adjust:
   - From (3.7, 9.1) to (5.7, 9.1) to stay above Obstacle 5
   - Then to (5.7, 0.5) to go below Obstacle 6

6. The path intersects Obstacle 9 between (8.1, 1.2) and (8.5, 1.2). We'll modify:
   - From (5.7, 0.5) to (8.1, 0.5) to stay below Obstacles 6, 7, and 8
   - Then to (8.5, 0.5) to go around Obstacle 9

7. The final approach to the goal set needs adjustment to avoid Obstacles 10-15:
   - Move to (8.5, 3.3) to go between Obstacles 14 and 15
   - Then to (9.1, 3.3) to approach the goal set
   - Finally to (9.5, 0.6) to end within the goal set

Based on this analysis, here's the new path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (0.9, 1.5),
    (0.9, 9.1),
    (2.5, 9.1),
    (3.7, 9.1),
    (5.7, 9.1),
    (5.7, 0.5),
    (8.1, 0.5),
    (8.5, 0.5),
    (8.5, 3.3),
    (9.1, 3.3),
    (9.5, 0.6)
]

This path should avoid all obstacles while starting and ending in the correct sets. It takes a wider berth around obstacles to ensure no intersections occur.

[09/09/2024 06:54:38 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and example. I'll analyze the path and make the necessary adjustments to avoid intersecting with obstacles while maintaining the start and end requirements.

Analysis and Adjustments:

1. Start point (0.5, 0.5) is correct and within the start set.

2. The path from (0.9, 1.5) to (0.9, 9.1) is valid and avoids Obstacle 1.

3. The segment from (0.9, 9.1) to (2.5, 9.1) intersects with Obstacle 3. To avoid this, we'll adjust the y-coordinate to pass below Obstacle 3:
   - New point: (2.3, 5.5)

4. We'll add a point to navigate between Obstacles 2 and 4:
   - New point: (3.0, 5.5)

5. The segment from (3.7, 9.1) to (5.7, 9.1) intersects with Obstacle 5. We'll adjust the path to go around it:
   - New points: (3.7, 5.5), (5.0, 5.5), (5.0, 0.5)

6. The segment from (5.7, 0.5) to (8.1, 0.5) intersects with Obstacle 6. We'll adjust to avoid it:
   - New points: (5.7, 0.7), (6.2, 0.7)

7. The segment from (8.1, 0.5) to (8.5, 0.5) intersects with Obstacle 9. We'll adjust to avoid it:
   - New point: (8.1, 0.7)

8. The rest of the path is valid, but we'll adjust the final approach to the goal set to ensure we don't get too close to any obstacles:
   - New points: (8.5, 0.7), (9.1, 0.7), (9.5, 0.6)

Based on this analysis, here's the new path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (0.9, 1.5),
    (0.9, 9.1),
    (2.3, 5.5),
    (3.0, 5.5),
    (3.7, 5.5),
    (5.0, 5.5),
    (5.0, 0.5),
    (5.7, 0.7),
    (6.2, 0.7),
    (8.1, 0.7),
    (8.5, 0.7),
    (9.1, 0.7),
    (9.5, 0.6)
]

This new path should avoid all obstacles while maintaining the start and end requirements. It navigates through the gaps between obstacles and maintains a safe distance from them.

[09/09/2024 06:54:49 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the path and make the necessary adjustments to avoid the obstacles. Let's go through the problematic segments and correct them.

1. Start point: (0.5, 0.5) is correct and within the start set.

2. The segment between (0.9, 9.1) and (2.3, 5.5) intersects Obstacle 1. We need to go around this obstacle.

3. The segment between (3.0, 5.5) and (3.7, 5.5) intersects Obstacle 4. We need to move this segment.

4. The segment between (3.7, 5.5) and (5.0, 5.5) intersects Obstacle 5. We need to adjust this part of the path.

5. The segment between (5.7, 0.7) and (6.2, 0.7) intersects Obstacle 6. We need to move around this obstacle.

6. The segment between (8.1, 0.7) and (8.5, 0.7) intersects Obstacle 9. We need to adjust this part.

7. The end point (9.5, 0.6) is correct and within the goal set.

Let's make the following adjustments:

1. Instead of going up to y=9.1, we'll stay lower to avoid Obstacle 1. We'll go to (0.9, 0.5) first.

2. To avoid Obstacle 1, we'll go around it to the right, moving to (1.4, 0.5), then (1.4, 5.5).

3. We'll adjust the path to go between Obstacles 2 and 4 by moving to (2.6, 5.5).

4. To avoid Obstacle 5, we'll go under it by moving to (4.5, 0.5).

5. We'll go around Obstacle 6 by moving to (5.6, 0.5), then (6.2, 0.5).

6. To avoid Obstacle 9, we'll move the path slightly down to y=0.5 for that segment.

7. Finally, we'll move up to the goal set.

Here's the new path with these adjustments:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start point
    (0.9, 0.5),   # Move right, staying low
    (1.4, 0.5),   # Move right to go around Obstacle 1

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements

[09/09/2024 06:55:01 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the path and make the necessary adjustments to avoid intersecting with obstacles while maintaining the start and end requirements.

Thought process and analysis:

1. Start point: The current start point (0.5, 0.5) is valid, so we'll keep it.

2. Obstacle 1: To avoid intersecting with Obstacle 1, we need to move around it. We can go either above or below it. Let's choose to go below it.

3. Obstacles 2 and 3: These obstacles create a narrow passage that we need to navigate through. We'll aim to pass between them.

4. Obstacle 4: We need to avoid this obstacle by going either above or below it. Let's choose to go below it.

5. Obstacles 5 to 8: These create a series of vertical obstacles that we need to weave through. We'll plan a path that zigzags between them.

6. Obstacles 9 to 15: These create a maze-like structure near the goal. We'll need to carefully navigate through the openings to reach the goal.

Based on this analysis, here's the new path with explanations:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),     # Start point, remains the same
    (0.9, 0.5),     # Move right, staying below Obstacle 1
    (1.3, 0.5),     # Move past Obstacle 1
    (2.0, 0.5),     # Continue moving right
    (2.6, 0.5),     # Pass between Obstacles 2 and 3
    (3.2, 0.5),     # Continue moving right
    (3.8, 0.5),     # Pass Obstacle 4
    (4.4, 0.5),     # Continue moving right
    (5.0, 0.5),     # Approach Obstacle 5
    (5.0, 6.5),     # Move up, passing between Obstacles 5 and 6
    (5.4, 6.5),     # Move right
    (5.4, 0.5),     # Move down, passing between Obstacles 6 and 7
    (6.4, 0.5),     # Move right, passing Obstacle 6
    (6.4, 6.5),     # Move up, passing between Obstacles 7 and 8
    (6.8, 6.5),     # Move right
    (6.8, 0.5),     # Move down, passing Obstacle 8
    (8.0, 0.5),     # Move right, approaching Obstacle 9
    (8.0, 8.7),     # Move up, passing Obstacle 9
    (8.8, 8.7),     # Move right, above Obstacle 10
    (8.8, 7.5),     # Move down, between Obstacles 10 and 11
    (9.5, 7.5),     # Move right, above Obstacle 12
    (9.5, 6.3),     # Move down, between Obstacles 12 and 13
    (8.8, 6.3),     # Move left, above Obstacle 14
    (8.8, 5.0),     # Move down, between Obstacles 13 and 14
    (9.5, 5.0),     # Move right, above Obstacle 15
    (9.5, 0.6)      # Move down to the goal set
]

This new path should avoid all obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. The path carefully navigates through the narrow passages and around the obstacles, maintaining a safe distance from each one.

[09/09/2024 06:55:13 PM] Thank you for the feedback. I'll analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and adjust the path to avoid intersecting with them. Let's go through the problematic segments and make corrections:

1. Start to Obstacle 1:
The path needs to avoid Obstacle 1 at x=1.2. We'll move the second point to (0.8, 0.5) to stay clear of this obstacle.

2. Between Obstacles 1 and 2:
We'll add a point at (1.8, 0.5) to navigate between these obstacles.

3. Passing Obstacle 2:
We'll move the point after Obstacle 2 to (2.6, 0.5) to avoid intersection.

4. Navigating Obstacle 4:
We'll add a point at (3.2, 0.5) before Obstacle 4 and another at (3.8, 0.5) after it.

5. Passing Obstacles 5 and 6:
We'll adjust the path to go between these obstacles by adding points at (4.4, 0.5) and (5.4, 0.5).

6. Navigating around Obstacle 7:
Instead of going up and over, we'll keep the path lower, adding a point at (6.2, 0.5).

7. Passing Obstacle 8:
We'll add a point at (7.4, 0.5) to stay clear of this obstacle.

8. Final approach to goal:
We'll adjust the approach to avoid intersecting with Obstacles 10-15. We'll go up to (8.0, 2.0), then (9.1, 2.0), and finally to the goal at (9.5, 0.6).

Based on this analysis, here's the new path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (0.8, 0.5),
    (1.8, 0.5),
    (2.6, 0.5),
    (3.2, 0.5),
    (3.8, 0.5),
    (4.4, 0.5),
    (5.4, 0.5),
    (6.2, 0.5),
    (7.4, 0.5),
    (8.0, 0.5),
    (8.0, 2.0),
    (9.1, 2.0),
    (9.5, 0.6)
]

This path starts in the start set, avoids all obstacles by maintaining a safe distance, and ends in the goal set. It takes a more direct route while ensuring no intersections with obstacles occur.

[09/09/2024 06:55:24 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the path and make the necessary adjustments to avoid intersecting with obstacles while maintaining a valid path from the start to the goal.

Analysis and thought process:

1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. We need to adjust the path to avoid intersecting with Obstacles 1, 2, 4, 6, and 9.
3. There's a narrow passage between most obstacles, so we'll need to carefully navigate through these gaps.
4. We'll add more waypoints to create a zigzag pattern that avoids all obstacles.

Let's adjust the path:

1. Start point (0.5, 0.5) is fine.
2. To avoid Obstacle 1, we'll move up to (0.8, 1.5) before moving right.
3. We'll go between Obstacles 1 and 2 at (1.6, 1.5).
4. To avoid Obstacle 2, we'll move down to (2.0, 0.5) before continuing.
5. We'll go between Obstacles 2 and 3 at (2.8, 0.5).
6. To avoid Obstacle 4, we'll move up to (3.2, 1.5) and then back down to (4.0, 0.5).
7. We'll go between Obstacles 4 and 5 at (4.4, 0.5).
8. To avoid Obstacle 6, we'll move up to (5.4, 1.5) and then back down to (6.4, 0.5).
9. We'll go between Obstacles 7 and 8 at (6.6, 0.5).
10. To avoid Obstacle 9, we'll move up to (7.6, 1.5) before continuing right.
11. We'll navigate through the gaps in Obstacles 10-15 by zigzagging:
    - (8.0, 1.5) to avoid Obstacle 10
    - (8.8, 3.0) to go between Obstacles 12 and 13
    - (9.1, 4.0) to go between Obstacles 13 and 14
    - (9.1, 5.0) to go between Obstacles 14 and 15
12. Finally, we'll move to the goal point (9.5, 0.6).

New path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (0.8, 1.5),
    (1.6, 1.5),
    (2.0, 0.5),
    (2.8, 0.5),
    (3.2, 1.5),
    (4.0, 0.5),
    (4.4, 0.5),
    (5.4, 1.5),
    (6.4, 0.5),
    (6.6, 0.5),
    (7.6, 1.5),
    (8.0, 1.5),
    (8.8, 3.0),
    (9.1, 4.0),
    (9.1, 5.0),
    (9.5, 0.6)
]

This new path should avoid all obstacles while maintaining a valid route from the start to the goal position.

[09/09/2024 06:55:36 PM] Thank you for the feedback and example. I'll analyze the environment and provide a new path that avoids all obstacles.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issue is that the path intersects with several vertical obstacles. We need to find a way to weave between these obstacles.
3. There are horizontal gaps between obstacles that we can use to move upward or downward as needed.
4. We should aim to stay closer to the bottom of the environment to minimize the number of vertical movements required.

New path reasoning:
1. Start at (0.5, 0.5) within the start set.
2. Move right to (0.8, 0.5) to clear the first obstacle.
3. Go up to (0.8, 1.5) to prepare for crossing between obstacles 1 and 2.
4. Move right to (2.0, 1.5), staying above obstacle 2.
5. Go down to (2.0, 0.5) to pass under obstacle 3.
6. Move right to (3.2, 0.5), staying under obstacle 4.
7. Go up to (3.2, 1.5) to prepare for crossing between obstacles 4 and 5.
8. Move right to (4.4, 1.5), staying above obstacle 5.
9. Go down to (4.4, 0.5) to pass under obstacle 6.
10. Move right to (5.6, 0.5), staying under obstacle 7.
11. Go up to (5.6, 1.5) to prepare for crossing between obstacles 7 and 8.

[09/09/2024 06:55:48 PM] Thank you for the feedback. I'll analyze the path and make the necessary adjustments to avoid intersecting with obstacles. Let's go through the problematic segments and adjust them:

1. Start point: (0.5, 0.5) is good, as it's within the start set.

2. Obstacle 1: We need to avoid the vertical obstacle at x=1.1. Let's move to (0.9, 0.5) first, then go up to (0.9, 9.5) to clear all vertical obstacles.

3. Obstacles 2-8: These are vertical obstacles with gaps between them. We'll zigzag through these gaps, maintaining a safe distance.

4. Obstacles 9-15: These form a more complex pattern. We'll need to carefully navigate through the openings.

Analyzing the spatial relationships:
- There's a gap between obstacles 1 and 2 from y=5.0 to y=10.0
- Between obstacles 2 and 3, there's a gap from y=5.0 to y=6.0
- Similar gaps exist between the other vertical obstacles
- The horizontal obstacles near the goal create a maze-like pattern we need to navigate

Let's create a new path that avoids all these obstacles:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point
    (0.9, 0.5),    # Move right to avoid Obstacle 1
    (0.9, 9.5),    # Move up to clear all vertical obstacles
    (2.0, 9.5),    # Move right between Obstacles 1 and 2
    (2.0, 5.5),    # Move down to gap between Obstacles 2 and 3
    (3.2, 5.5),    # Move right between Obstacles 2 and 4
    (3.2, 9.5),    # Move up to clear Obstacle 4
    (4.4, 9.5),    # Move right between Obstacles 4 and 5
    (4.4, 1.5),    # Move down to clear Obstacle 5
    (5.6, 1.5),    # Move right between Obstacles 5 and 6
    (5.6, 6.5),    # Move up to gap between Obstacles 6 and 7
    (6.8, 6.5),    # Move right between Obstacles 7 and 8
    (6.8, 1.5),    # Move down to clear Obstacle 8
    (8.0, 1.5),    # Move right to approach final obstacles
    (8.0, 8.0),    # Move up to navigate final obstacles
    (8.8, 8.0),    # Move right between Obstacles 9 and 10
    (8.8, 7.5),    # Move down slightly
    (9.5, 7.5),    # Move right between Obstacles 10 and 11
    (9.5, 6.3),    # Move down between Obstacles 11 and 12
    (8.8, 6.3),    # Move left between Obstacles 12 and 13
    (8.8, 5.1),    # Move down between Obstacles 13 and 14
    (9.5, 5.1),    # Move right between Obstacles 14 and 15
    (9.5, 0.6)     # Move down to end point in goal set
]

This new path should avoid all obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. It maintains a safe distance from all obstacles and navigates through the available gaps.

Analysis and Corrections:

1. Start to Obstacle 5:
The path from (0.5, 0.5) to (4.4, 1.5) is valid. However, the segment from (4.4, 1.5) to (5.6, 1.5) intersects Obstacle 5. We need to go around this obstacle.

2. Obstacle 5 to Obstacle 8:
We'll adjust the path to go around Obstacle 5, then proceed towards Obstacle 6. The segment from (6.8, 1.5) to (8.0, 1.5) intersects Obstacle 8, so we'll need to adjust this as well.

3. Navigating between Obstacles 8 and 9:
We need to carefully maneuver between these obstacles. The segment from (8.0, 8.0) to (8.8, 8.0) intersects Obstacle 9, so we'll adjust this path.

4. Final approach to goal:
The path intersects several obstacles (11, 12, 13, 15) on its way to the goal. We'll need to zigzag between these obstacles to reach the goal safely.

New path with explanations:

1. (0.5, 0.5) - Start point
2. (0.9, 0.5) - Move right to avoid Obstacle 1
3. (0.9, 9.5) - Move up to clear most obstacles
4. (2.0, 9.5) - Move right between Obstacles 2 and 3
5. (2.0, 5.5) - Move down to prepare for next move
6. (3.2, 5.5) - Move right between Obstacles 3 and 4
7. (3.2, 9.5) - Move up to clear Obstacle 4
8. (4.4, 9.5) - Move right to approach Obstacle 5
9. (4.4, 1.2) - Move down, staying clear of Obstacle 5
10. (5.6, 1.2) - Move right, below Obstacle 5
11. (5.6, 6.5) - Move up between Obstacles 6 and 7
12. (6.8, 6.5) - Move right to approach Obstacle 8
13. (6.8, 1.2) - Move down, staying clear of Obstacle 8
14. (7.8, 1.2) - Move right, staying below Obstacle 8
15. (7.8, 8.0) - Move up, staying left of Obstacle 9
16. (8.1, 8.0) - Move slightly right, still avoiding Obstacle 9
17. (8.1, 8.7) - Move up to prepare for zigzag
18. (9.1, 8.7) - Move right above Obstacle 10
19. (9.1, 7.5) - Move down between Obstacles 10 and 11
20. (9.5, 7.5) - Move right to edge of safe zone
21. (9.5, 6.3) - Move down between Obstacles 11 and 12
22. (8.6, 6.3) - Move left to avoid Obstacle 12
23. (8.6, 5.1) - Move down between Obstacles 12 and 13
24. (9.5, 5.1) - Move right to edge of safe zone
25. (9.5, 3.9) - Move down between Obstacles 13 and 14
26. (8.6, 3.9) - Move left to avoid Obstacle 14
27. (8.6, 2.7) - Move down between Obstacles 14 and 15
28. (9.5, 2.7) - Move right to edge of safe zone
29. (9.5, 0.6) - Move down to goal area

[09/09/2024 06:56:16 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the path and make the necessary adjustments to avoid intersecting with obstacles. Here's my thought process and the changes I'll make:

1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.

2. For the first intersection with Obstacle 5, we need to adjust the path between (4.4, 1.5) and (5.6, 1.5). We can go around this obstacle by moving up slightly before proceeding.

3. To avoid Obstacle 8, we'll need to adjust the path between (6.8, 1.5) and (8.0, 1.5). We can go around this obstacle by moving up before continuing.

4. For the intersection with Obstacle 9, we need to adjust the path between (8.0, 8.0) and (8.8, 8.0). We can avoid this by moving down slightly before proceeding.

5. To avoid intersecting with Obstacle 11, we'll adjust the path between (9.5, 7.5) and (9.5, 6.3) by moving slightly to the left.

6. For the intersection with Obstacle 12, we'll modify the path between (8.8, 6.3) and (8.8, 5.1) by moving slightly to the left.

7. Finally, to avoid Obstacles 13 and 15, we'll adjust the final approach to the goal by zigzagging between the obstacles.

Based on these considerations, here's the new path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (0.9, 0.5),
    (0.9, 9.5),
    (2.0, 9.5),
    (2.0, 5.5),
    (3.2, 5.5),
    (3.2, 9.5),
    (4.4, 9.5),
    (4.4, 1.5),
    (4.5, 1.5),
    (4.5, 2.0),
    (5.6, 2.0),
    (5.6, 6.5),
    (6.8, 6.5),
    (6.8, 1.5),
    (6.9, 1.5),
    (6.9, 2.0),
    (8.0, 2.0),
    (8.0, 7.8),
    (8.8, 7.8),
    (8.8, 7.5),
    (9.2, 7.5),
    (9.2, 6.3),
    (8.6, 6.3),
    (8.6, 5.1),
    (9.2, 5.1),
    (9.2, 5.0),
    (9.5, 5.0),
    (9.5, 4.8),
    (9.2, 4.8),
    (9.2, 2.6),
    (9.5, 2.6),
    (9.5, 2.2),
    (9.2, 2.2),
    (9.2, 0.6)
]

This new path should avoid all obstacles while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. The zigzag pattern at the end ensures we avoid the horizontal obstacles while approaching the goal.

[09/09/2024 06:56:48 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback. I'll analyze the path and make the necessary corrections to avoid intersecting with the obstacles. Let's go through the problematic segments and adjust the path accordingly.

1. Start of the path:
The start point (0.5, 0.5) is correct and within the start set. We'll keep this as is.

2. Segments intersecting with Obstacle 5 and Obstacle 8:
To avoid intersecting with Obstacle 5 [[4.8, 10.0], [4.6, 10.0], [4.6, 1.0], [4.8, 1.0]] and Obstacle 8 [[7.2, 10.0], [7.0, 10.0], [7.0, 1.0], [7.2, 1.0]], we need to adjust the y-coordinate of the path when passing between these obstacles. We'll raise the path to y = 1.2 to clear both obstacles.

3. Segments intersecting with Obstacle 9:
Multiple segments are intersecting with Obstacle 9 [[8.4, 8.5], [8.2, 8.5], [8.2, -0.0], [8.4, -0.0]]. To avoid this, we'll need to go around this obstacle entirely. We can do this by moving to the left of the obstacle (x = 8.0) and then moving upwards and around it.

4. Navigating through the horizontal obstacles:
We'll need to carefully navigate through the horizontal obstacles (Obstacles 10-15) by moving between them.

5. End of the path:
The end point (9.5, 0.6) is correct and within the goal set. We'll keep this as the final destination.

Based on these considerations, here's the new adjusted path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),     # Start point
    (0.9, 0.5),     # Move right to clear first obstacle
    (0.9, 9.5),     # Move up
    (2.0, 9.5),     # Move right
    (2.0, 5.5),     # Move down
    (3.2, 5.5),     # Move right
    (3.2, 9.5),     # Move up
    (4.4, 9.5),     # Move right
    (4.4, 1.2),     # Move down, but stay above Obstacle 5
    (5.6, 1.2),     # Move right, clearing Obstacle 5
    (5.6, 6.5),     # Move up
    (6.8, 6.5),     # Move right
    (6.8, 1.2),     # Move down, but stay above Obstacle 8
    (8.0, 1.2),     # Move right, clearing Obstacle 8
    (8.0, 8.7),     # Move up, going to the left of Obstacle 9
    (8.6, 8.7),     # Move right, above Obstacle 9
    (8.6, 8.7),     # Staying in place (redundant point, can be removed)
    (9.1, 8.7),     # Move right
    (9.1, 7.5),     # Move down between Obstacles 10 and 11
    (8.6, 7.5),     # Move left
    (8.6, 6.3),     # Move down between Obstacles 11 and 12
    (9.1, 6.3),     # Move right
    (9.1, 5.1),     # Move down between Obstacles 12 and 13
    (8.6, 5.1),     # Move left
    (8.6, 3.9),     # Move down between Obstacles 13 and 14
    (9.1, 3.9),     # Move right
    (9.1, 2.7),     # Move down between Obstacles 14 and 15
    (8.6, 2.7),     # Move left
    (8.6, 1.0),     # Move down, clearing all obstacles

[09/09/2024 06:57:03 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback. I'll analyze the path and make necessary corrections to avoid intersecting with the obstacles while maintaining the start and end points within their respective sets.

Analysis and Corrections:

1. Start point (0.5, 0.5) is correct and within the start set.

2. The path from (4.4, 1.5) to (5.6, 1.5) intersects Obstacle 5. To avoid this, we'll go around the obstacle:
   - Move to (4.5, 1.5), then (4.5, 0.5), (5.5, 0.5), and (5.5, 1.5)

3. The path from (6.8, 1.5) to (8.0, 1.5) intersects Obstacle 8. We'll go around:
   - Move to (6.9, 1.5), then (6.9, 0.5), (7.3, 0.5), and (7.3, 1.5)

4. Multiple segments intersect with Obstacle 9 in the range of x-coordinates 8.2 to 8.4. We need to reroute this entire section:
   - Instead of zigzagging through this area, we'll go around Obstacle 9 on the left side.
   - After (7.3, 1.5), we'll move to (8.0, 1.5), (8.0, 8.7), and then (8.5, 8.7)

5. For the final approach to the goal, we'll carefully navigate between the horizontal obstacles:
   - From (8.5, 8.7), move to (9.2, 8.7), (9.2, 7.5), (9.2, 6.3), (9.2, 5.1), (9.2, 3.9), (9.2, 2.7), and finally to the goal area.

6. End point (9.5, 0.6) is correct and within the goal set.

New path incorporating these changes:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (0.9, 0.5),
    (0.9, 9.5),
    (2.0, 9.5),

    (7.3, 0.5),
    (7.3, 1.5),
    (8.0, 1.5),
    (8.0, 8.7),
    (8.5, 8.7),

    (9.2, 2.7),
    (9.2, 1.0),
    (9.5, 1.0),
    (9.5, 0.6)
]

This new path should avoid all obstacles while maintaining the start and end points within their respective sets.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/09/2024 06:57:19 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and example. I'll analyze the path and make the necessary corrections to avoid intersecting with the obstacles.

Analysis and Corrections:

1. The path from (9.2, 8.7) to (9.2, 7.5) intersects with Obstacle 10. To avoid this, we need to go around the obstacle.

2. The path from (9.2, 6.3) to (9.2, 5.1) intersects with Obstacle 12. We need to adjust this segment.

3. The path from (9.2, 3.9) to (9.2, 2.7) intersects with Obstacle 14. This segment also needs to be modified.

4. The rest of the path seems to avoid obstacles correctly.

Adjusted Path:

1. We'll keep the path up to point (8.0, 8.7) as it is.

2. To avoid Obstacle 10, we'll go around it to the left, then continue downwards.

3. We'll adjust the path to zigzag between the horizontal obstacles (10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15) by moving left and right as we go down.

4. Finally, we'll approach the goal set from the left side.

Here's the new path with explanations:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start point (unchanged)
    (0.9, 0.5), (0.9, 9.5), (2.0, 9.5), (2.0, 5.5), (3.2, 5.5), (3.2, 9.5), (4.4, 9.5), (4.4, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), (4.5, 0.5), (5.5, 0.5), (5.5, 1.5), (5.6, 1.5), (5.6, 6.5), (6.8, 6.5), (6.8, 1.5), (6.9, 1.5), (6.9, 0.5), (7.3, 0.5), (7.3, 1.5), (8.0, 1.5),  # These points remain unchanged
    (8.0, 8.7),  # Approach Obstacle 10 from below
    (8.3, 8.7),  # Move right, staying below Obstacle 10
    (8.3, 8.6),  # Move slightly down to avoid touching Obstacle 10
    (9.2, 8.6),  # Move right, passing below Obstacle 10
    (9.2, 7.4),  # Move down, staying right of Obstacle 10 and above Obstacle 11
    (8.3, 7.4),  # Move left, above Obstacle 11
    (8.3, 6.2),  # Move down, left of Obstacle 12
    (9.2, 6.2),  # Move right, above Obstacle 12
    (9.2, 5.0),  # Move down, right of Obstacle 12 and above Obstacle 13
    (8.3, 5.0),  # Move left, above Obstacle 13
    (8.3, 3.8),  # Move down, left of Obstacle 14
    (9.2, 3.8),  # Move right, above Obstacle 14
    (9.2, 2.6),  # Move down, right of Obstacle 14 and above Obstacle 15
    (8.3, 2.6),  # Move left, above Obstacle 15
    (8.3, 1.0),  # Move down, left of all obstacles
    (9.5, 1.0),  # Move right towards the goal set
    (9.5, 0.6)   # Move down to enter the goal set
]

This new path should avoid all obstacles while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. The zigzag pattern between the horizontal obstacles ensures that we don't intersect with any of them while making our way down to the goal set.
