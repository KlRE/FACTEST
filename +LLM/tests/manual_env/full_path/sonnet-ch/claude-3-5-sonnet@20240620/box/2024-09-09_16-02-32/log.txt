# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/09/2024 04:02:39 PM] After analyzing the provided data, I've devised a path that satisfies the given requirements. Here's my analysis and the resulting path:

1. The start position is within the quadrilateral [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]].
2. The goal position is within the quadrilateral [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]].
3. There's one obstacle: a diamond-shaped quadrilateral [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]].

The path needs to avoid this central obstacle. We can do this by going around either the top-left or bottom-right corner of the obstacle. I've chosen to go around the top-left corner for this solution.

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start point within the start set
    (0.5, 5.5),    # Move to a point above and left of the obstacle
    (5.0, 10.0),   # Move to a point above and right of the obstacle
    (9.0, 9.0)     # End point within the goal set
]

Explanation of the waypoints:
1. (1.75, 1.75): This point is within the start set.
2. (0.5, 5.5): This point is chosen to be safely above and to the left of the obstacle.
3. (5.0, 10.0): This point is chosen to be safely above the obstacle, allowing the path to move towards the goal set.
4. (9.0, 9.0): This point is within the goal set.

This path satisfies all the requirements:
- It starts within the start set and ends within the goal set.
- It avoids the obstacle by maintaining a safe distance.
- The linear segments between waypoints do not intersect with the obstacle.

The path takes a wide berth around the obstacle to ensure it doesn't come close to touching it at any point.
