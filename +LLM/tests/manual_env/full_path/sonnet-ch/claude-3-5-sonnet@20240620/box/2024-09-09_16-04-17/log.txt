# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]

[09/09/2024 04:04:24 PM] Based on the provided data and instructions, I'll create a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids the given obstacle. Here's my analysis and proposed path:

1. The start set is a quadrilateral near the bottom-left of the space.
2. The goal set is a quadrilateral near the top-right of the space.
3. There's one large diamond-shaped obstacle in the center of the space.

To avoid the obstacle, we'll need to go around it. Given the positions of the start and goal sets, it makes sense to go around the top of the obstacle.

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start point within the start set
    (1.75, 9.5),   # Move up to clear the top of the obstacle
    (9.0, 9.5),    # Move right, staying above the obstacle
    (9.0, 9.0)     # Move down slightly to end within the goal set
]

Explanation of the path:
1. (1.75, 1.75): This point is within the start set, near its center.
2. (1.75, 9.5): We move straight up, clearing the top point of the diamond-shaped obstacle (which is at y=9.0).
3. (9.0, 9.5): We move right, staying above the obstacle, until we're close to the goal set.
4. (9.0, 9.0): We move down slightly to end within the goal set.

This path satisfies all requirements:
- It starts within the start set and ends within the goal set.
- It avoids the obstacle by a safe margin.
- The linear segments between waypoints do not intersect the obstacle.
- It provides a relatively simple and direct path from start to goal.

[09/09/2024 04:04:30 PM] Thank you for the feedback. I'll analyze the problem and provide a corrected path with explanations.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct.
2. The main issue was that the first segment intersected with Obstacle 1.
3. Obstacle 1 is a diamond-shaped obstacle in the center of the space.

Thought process for correction:
1. We need to avoid the diamond-shaped obstacle while moving from the start to the goal.
2. The obstacle extends from (1,5) to (9,5) at its widest points, so we can't simply go around it horizontally.
3. We can go around either the left or right side of the obstacle. Let's choose the left side for this path.
4. We'll add waypoints to navigate around the obstacle's left side.

New path explanation:
1. Start at (1.75, 1.75) within the start set.
2. Move left to (1.0, 1.75) to clear the left edge of the obstacle.
3. Move up to (1.0, 5.5) to get above the obstacle's left point.
4. Move right to (5.5, 5.5) to clear the top of the obstacle.
5. Move up and right to (9.0, 9.0) to reach the goal set.

Here's the new path:

new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start point
    (1.0, 1.75),   # Move left to clear obstacle
    (1.0, 5.5),    # Move up past the obstacle's left point
    (5.5, 5.5),    # Move right to clear the top of the obstacle
    (9.0, 9.0)     # End point in goal set
]

This path should avoid intersecting with the obstacle while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. The waypoints are chosen to keep a safe distance from the obstacle's edges.

[09/09/2024 04:04:51 PM] Thank you for the feedback. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points were correct in the previous path.
2. The main issue is that the path intersects with the large diamond-shaped obstacle (Obstacle 1).
3. We need to find a way around this obstacle while maintaining a safe distance.

Spatial analysis:
1. The obstacle is centered at (5, 5) and extends diagonally.
2. There's more space in the lower-left and upper-right corners of the environment.
3. We can utilize these spaces to create a path that avoids the obstacle.

New path strategy:
1. Start from the same point in the start set.
2. Move towards the lower-left corner to avoid the obstacle.
3. Then move upwards along the left side of the obstacle.
4. Navigate around the top of the obstacle.
5. Finally, approach the goal set from above.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start point (same as before)
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Move to lower-left corner
    (0.5, 5.5),    # Move up along the left side of the obstacle
    (5.0, 10.0),   # Navigate around the top of the obstacle
    (9.0, 9.0)     # End point (same as before)
]

Explanation of changes:
1. The first waypoint (1.75, 1.75) remains in the start set.
2. We add a new waypoint (0.5, 0.5) to move away from the obstacle's lower-left corner.
3. The waypoint (0.5, 5.5) allows us to move upwards while staying clear of the obstacle's left side.
4. We then add a point (5.0, 10.0) to navigate around the top of the obstacle. This point is chosen to be sufficiently far from the obstacle's upper vertex.
5. The final waypoint (9.0, 9.0) remains in the goal set.

This path should avoid intersecting with the obstacle while maintaining a safe distance. It utilizes the available space in the environment to create a feasible route from the start set to the goal set.
