# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]

[09/09/2024 04:04:04 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll create a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids the given obstacle. Here's my analysis and proposed path:

1. The start set is a quadrilateral near the bottom-left of the space.
2. The goal set is a quadrilateral near the top-right of the space.
3. There's one large diamond-shaped obstacle in the center of the space.

To avoid the obstacle, we'll need to go around it. Given the positions of the start and goal sets, it makes sense to go around the top of the obstacle. Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start point within the start set
    (1.75, 9.5),   # Move up to clear the top of the obstacle
    (9.0, 9.5),    # Move right, staying above the obstacle
    (9.0, 9.0)     # Move down slightly to end within the goal set
]

Reasoning:
1. We start at (1.75, 1.75), which is within the start set.
2. We move straight up to (1.75, 9.5) to clear the top of the diamond-shaped obstacle.
3. Then we move right to (9.0, 9.5), staying well above the obstacle.
4. Finally, we move down slightly to (9.0, 9.0) to end within the goal set.

This path maintains a safe distance from the obstacle at all times and meets all the specified requirements.

[09/09/2024 04:04:10 PM] HTTP Request: POST https://europe-west1-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/gentle-keyword-432706-b3/locations/europe-west1/publishers/anthropic/models/claude-3-5-sonnet@20240620:rawPredict "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[09/09/2024 04:04:10 PM] Thank you for the feedback. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacle.

Analysis:
1. The start point (1.75, 1.75) is correct as it's within the start set.
2. The end point (9.0, 9.0) is correct as it's within the goal set.
3. The main issue is that the path intersects with Obstacle 1, which is a diamond-shaped obstacle in the center of the space.

To avoid the obstacle, we need to go around it. Given the positions of the start and goal sets, it makes sense to go around the left side of the obstacle. Here's my thought process for creating a new path:

1. Start from the same point (1.75, 1.75) in the start set.
2. Move left to avoid the obstacle. We'll go to x=0.5, which is safely to the left of the obstacle's leftmost point (1.0).
3. Move upwards to a point above the obstacle. The obstacle's highest point is at y=9.0, so we'll go to y=9.5.
4. Move right towards the goal set. We can go directly to x=9.0.
5. Move down to enter the goal set at (9.0, 9.0).

Based on this analysis, here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start point (unchanged)
    (0.5, 1.75),   # Move left to avoid obstacle
    (0.5, 9.5),    # Move up, clearing the obstacle
    (9.0, 9.5),    # Move right towards goal
    (9.0, 9.0)     # Move down to enter goal set
]

This path should successfully avoid the obstacle while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. It keeps a safe distance from the obstacle at all times, ensuring no intersection occurs.
