# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/09/2024 04:02:24 PM] Thank you for providing the detailed task description and example. I'll analyze the given environment and propose a path that meets the requirements.

Analysis of the environment:
1. The start position is a quadrilateral in the bottom-left area of the space.
2. The goal position is a quadrilateral in the top-right area of the space.
3. There is one large, diamond-shaped obstacle in the center of the space.
4. The path needs to avoid this obstacle while moving from the start to the goal.

Proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start point within the start quadrilateral
    (0.5, 3.0),    # Move left and up to avoid the obstacle
    (0.5, 7.0),    # Continue moving up
    (7.0, 9.5),    # Move diagonally up and right, staying above the obstacle
    (9.0, 9.0)     # End point within the goal quadrilateral
]

Explanation of the path:
1. The path starts at (1.75, 1.75), which is within the start quadrilateral.
2. It then moves left and up to (0.5, 3.0) to avoid the left corner of the diamond-shaped obstacle.
3. The path continues upward to (0.5, 7.0), staying clear of the left side of the obstacle.
4. From there, it moves diagonally up and right to (7.0, 9.5), passing above the obstacle.
5. Finally, it reaches the goal quadrilateral at (9.0, 9.0).

This path satisfies all the requirements:
- It starts within the start set and ends within the goal set.
- It avoids the obstacle by maintaining a safe distance.
- The linear segments connecting the waypoints do not intersect with the obstacle.
- The path is represented as an array of waypoints that can be linearly connected.

[09/09/2024 04:02:32 PM] HTTP Request: POST https://europe-west1-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/gentle-keyword-432706-b3/locations/europe-west1/publishers/anthropic/models/claude-3-5-sonnet@20240620:rawPredict "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[09/09/2024 04:02:32 PM] Thank you for the feedback. I'll analyze the problem and propose a new path that avoids the obstacle.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct.
2. The main issue is with the segment from (0.5, 7.0) to (7.0, 9.5), which intersects with the large diamond-shaped obstacle.
3. We need to find a way around this obstacle while maintaining a safe distance.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Keep the starting point (1.75, 1.75) as it's within the start set.
2. Instead of going directly north and then east, we'll go northeast to avoid the lower part of the obstacle.
3. We'll aim for a point that's just outside the western corner of the obstacle.
4. From there, we'll move north to clear the top of the obstacle.
5. Finally, we'll move east and slightly south to reach the goal set.

New path proposal:

new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start point (unchanged)
    (0.75, 4.75),  # Move northeast, staying clear of the obstacle's southwest edge
    (0.75, 9.25),  # Move north, clearing the western point of the obstacle
    (5.0, 9.25),   # Move east, staying above the obstacle
    (9.0, 9.0)     # Move southeast to the goal set (unchanged)
]

Explanation of the new path:
1. (1.75, 1.75) to (0.75, 4.75): This segment moves northeast, avoiding the lower part of the diamond-shaped obstacle.
2. (0.75, 4.75) to (0.75, 9.25): This vertical segment moves north, clearing the leftmost point of the obstacle with a safe margin.
3. (0.75, 9.25) to (5.0, 9.25): This horizontal segment moves east, staying above the obstacle.
4. (5.0, 9.25) to (9.0, 9.0): This final segment moves southeast to enter the goal set.

This path should avoid intersecting with the obstacle while maintaining a safe distance from it. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set as required.
