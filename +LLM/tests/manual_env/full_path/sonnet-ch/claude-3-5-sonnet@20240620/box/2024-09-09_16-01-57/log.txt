# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]

[09/09/2024 04:02:03 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll create a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids the obstacle. Here's my analysis and proposed path:

1. The start set is a quadrilateral near the bottom-left of the space.
2. The goal set is a quadrilateral near the top-right of the space.
3. There's one large diamond-shaped obstacle in the center of the space.

To avoid the obstacle, we'll need to go around it. Given the positions of the start and goal sets, it makes sense to go around the bottom-right side of the obstacle.

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start point within the start set
    (3.0, 1.0),    # Move to the right and slightly down to avoid the bottom point of the obstacle
    (7.0, 3.0),    # Move diagonally up and right, passing below the right point of the obstacle
    (8.5, 6.0),    # Continue moving up and right, staying clear of the obstacle
    (9.0, 9.0)     # End point within the goal set
]

Explanation of the path:
1. We start at (1.75, 1.75), which is within the start set.
2. We then move to (3.0, 1.0) to get around the bottom point of the obstacle.
3. Next, we move diagonally to (7.0, 3.0), passing below the right point of the obstacle.
4. We continue moving up and right to (8.5, 6.0), staying clear of the obstacle.
5. Finally, we end at (9.0, 9.0), which is within the goal set.

This path should satisfy all the requirements:
- It starts within the start set and ends within the goal set.
- It avoids the obstacle, maintaining a safe distance at all times.
- The linear segments between waypoints do not intersect the obstacle.
- It provides a reasonably direct route from start to goal while prioritizing obstacle avoidance.

[09/09/2024 04:02:10 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting the start and end requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct, so we can keep those.
2. The main issue is that the path intersects with the large diamond-shaped obstacle (Obstacle 1).
3. We need to find a way around this obstacle while keeping a safe distance.

Spatial analysis:
1. The obstacle is diamond-shaped, centered at (5, 5).
2. There's more space below the obstacle than above it, considering our start and end points.
3. We can go around the bottom-left corner of the obstacle to reach the goal.

New path planning:
1. Start at (1.75, 1.75) as before, which is within the start set.
2. Move to a point below the bottom-left corner of the obstacle, around (3, 0.5).
3. Then move to a point past the bottom-right corner of the obstacle, around (7, 0.5).
4. From there, move upwards to a point near the right side of the obstacle, around (8, 5).
5. Finally, move to the goal point at (9, 9) as before.

Based on this analysis, here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start point (unchanged)
    (3.0, 0.5),    # Below the bottom-left corner of the obstacle
    (7.0, 0.5),    # Past the bottom-right corner of the obstacle
    (8.0, 5.0),    # Up to the right side of the obstacle
    (9.0, 9.0)     # Goal point (unchanged)
]

This path should avoid intersecting with the obstacle while maintaining a safe distance. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set as required. The waypoints are chosen to create linear segments that don't cross the obstacle, providing a clear and safe path around it.

[09/09/2024 04:02:18 PM] Thank you for the feedback and example. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct, so we can keep them.
2. The main issue is with segments 3 and 4, which intersect with the diamond-shaped obstacle.
3. We need to find a way around this obstacle while maintaining a safe distance.

Thought process:
1. The obstacle is centered at (5, 5) and extends diagonally from (1, 5) to (9, 5).
2. To avoid it, we can go around either the left or right side.
3. Given that our goal is in the top-right quadrant, it makes sense to go around the right side of the obstacle.
4. We'll need to add more waypoints to create a path that curves around the obstacle.

New path proposal:
1. Start at (1.75, 1.75) as before.
2. Move to (3.0, 0.5) to get below the obstacle.
3. Add a new point at (7.0, 0.5) to stay below the obstacle.
4. Add a new point at (9.5, 5.5) to move to the right of the obstacle.
5. Finally, move to (9.0, 9.0) to reach the goal area.

This path should avoid intersecting with the obstacle while maintaining a safe distance.

new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start point (unchanged)
    (3.0, 0.5),    # Move below the obstacle (unchanged)
    (7.0, 0.5),    # Stay below the obstacle (unchanged)
    (9.5, 5.5),    # New point to move right of the obstacle
    (9.0, 9.0)     # End point (unchanged)
]

This new path should satisfy all the requirements:
1. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
2. It avoids intersecting with the obstacle by going around its right side.
3. It maintains a safe distance from the obstacle at all points.
4. The path is represented as an array of waypoints that can be linearly connected.
