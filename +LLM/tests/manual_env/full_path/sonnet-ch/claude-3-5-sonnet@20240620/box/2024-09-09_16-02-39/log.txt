# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]

[09/09/2024 04:02:44 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll create a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids the given obstacle. Here's my analysis and proposed path:

1. The start position is a quadrilateral near the bottom-left of the space.
2. The goal position is a quadrilateral near the top-right of the space.
3. There's one large diamond-shaped obstacle in the center of the space.

To avoid the obstacle, we'll need to go around it. Given the positions of the start and goal, it seems most efficient to go around the right side of the obstacle.

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start point within the start quadrilateral
    (3.0, 1.75),   # Move right to clear the bottom point of the obstacle
    (7.0, 5.0),    # Move diagonally up and right, staying clear of the obstacle's right side
    (8.0, 7.0),    # Continue moving up and right, preparing to approach the goal
    (9.0, 9.0)     # End point within the goal quadrilateral
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set
2. Ends within the goal set
3. Avoids the obstacle by maintaining a safe distance from its edges
4. Uses straight line segments between waypoints
5. Does not cross the obstacle at any point

The path first moves right to clear the bottom point of the obstacle, then moves diagonally to stay clear of the obstacle's right side, and finally approaches the goal from a safe angle.

[09/09/2024 04:03:06 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct.
2. The main issue was that segments 2 and 3 intersected with Obstacle 1, which is a large diamond-shaped obstacle in the center of the space.
3. We need to find a way around this obstacle while keeping a safe distance from its edges.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Start point: We'll keep the same start point (1.75, 1.75) as it's within the start set.
2. To avoid the lower part of Obstacle 1, we'll first move to the left, then up.
3. We'll then move diagonally to pass above the top vertex of Obstacle 1.
4. Finally, we'll approach the goal set from the top-left.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start point (same as before)
    (1.0, 1.75),   # Move left to avoid the bottom of Obstacle 1
    (1.0, 5.5),    # Move up, clearing the left vertex of Obstacle 1
    (5.5, 9.5),    # Move diagonally up-right, passing above Obstacle 1
    (8.5, 9.5),    # Move right to approach the goal set
    (9.0, 9.0)     # End point within the goal set
]

Explanation of the new path:
1. (1.75, 1.75) to (1.0, 1.75): This segment moves left, avoiding the bottom-left part of Obstacle 1.
2. (1.0, 1.75) to (1.0, 5.5): This vertical segment clears the left vertex of Obstacle 1 with a safe margin.
3. (1.0, 5.5) to (5.5, 9.5): This diagonal segment passes above Obstacle 1, avoiding its top vertex.
4. (5.5, 9.5) to (8.5, 9.5): This horizontal segment approaches the goal set from the top.
5. (8.5, 9.5) to (9.0, 9.0): This final segment enters the goal set and reaches the end point.

This path should avoid intersecting with Obstacle 1 while maintaining a safe distance from its edges. It starts within the start set and ends within the goal set, meeting all the specified requirements.

[09/09/2024 04:03:14 PM] Thank you for the feedback. I'll analyze the situation and provide an improved path that avoids the obstacle.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The problematic segment is between (1.0, 1.75) and (1.0, 5.5), which intersects with Obstacle 1.
3. Obstacle 1 is a diamond shape centered at (5.0, 5.0), extending from (1.0, 5.0) to (9.0, 5.0) horizontally and (5.0, 1.0) to (5.0, 9.0) vertically.
4. To avoid this obstacle, we need to go around it either to the left or to the right.
5. Given that our goal is in the top-right quadrant, it makes sense to go around the left side of the obstacle.

Path improvement:
1. We'll keep the start point at (1.75, 1.75).
2. Instead of going directly to (1.0, 5.5), we'll add waypoints to go around the left side of the obstacle.
3. We'll aim to pass near the point (1.0, 5.0), which is the leftmost point of the obstacle, but give it some clearance.
4. After passing the obstacle, we can move towards the goal more directly.
5. We'll keep the final approach to the goal similar to the original path.

New path:

new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start point (unchanged)
    (0.5, 1.75),   # Move left to clear the obstacle
    (0.5, 5.5),    # Move up, passing to the left of the obstacle with some clearance
    (2.0, 7.0),    # Move right and up, starting to angle towards the goal
    (5.5, 9.5),    # Continue moving towards the goal (unchanged)
    (8.5, 9.5),    # Approach to goal (unchanged)
    (9.0, 9.0)     # End point (unchanged)
]

This new path should avoid intersecting with Obstacle 1 by going around its left side. The path starts in the correct start set, ends in the correct goal set, and should maintain a safe distance from the obstacle throughout its trajectory.
