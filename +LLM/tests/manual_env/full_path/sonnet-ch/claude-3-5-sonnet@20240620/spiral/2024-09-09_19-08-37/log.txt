# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.75, 0.75], [0.25, 0.75], [0.25, 0.25], [0.75, 0.25]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.0, 0.0], [-2.0, 0.0], [-2.0, -2.0], [15.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.0, 15.0], [-2.0, 15.0], [-2.0, -0.0], [0.0, -0.0]]

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

[09/09/2024 07:08:43 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll create a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids all obstacles. Let's analyze the environment:

1. The start area is a square between (0.25, 0.25) and (0.75, 0.75).
2. The goal area is a square between (4.0, 4.0) and (5.0, 5.0).
3. Obstacle 1 and 2 create a narrow passage near the start area.
4. There's a clear path between Obstacles 3 and 4.
5. We need to navigate around Obstacle 5 to reach the goal.

Considering these factors, here's a proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),     # Start point within the start set
    (0.5, 1.5),     # Move upwards to clear Obstacle 1
    (3.5, 1.5),     # Move right, staying below Obstacle 3
    (3.5, 3.5),     # Move up, staying left of Obstacle 4
    (4.5, 3.5),     # Move right, staying below Obstacle 5
    (4.5, 4.5)      # End point within the goal set
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set at (0.5, 0.5).
2. Moves upward to avoid Obstacle 1.
3. Moves right, staying below Obstacle 3 and above Obstacle 4.
4. Navigates around Obstacle 5 by moving up and then right.
5. Ends within the goal set at (4.5, 4.5).

The path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles and consists of straight-line segments between waypoints, satisfying the non-crossing requirement. It efficiently navigates through the available spaces between obstacles to reach the goal.

[09/09/2024 07:09:04 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and example. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issue is that the path intersects with Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 4.
3. We need to find a way around these obstacles while maintaining a safe distance.
4. There's a clear path between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3, which we can utilize.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Start from the same point (0.5, 0.5) in the start set.
2. Move right to avoid Obstacle 2, but stay clear of Obstacle 3.
3. Move upwards between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3.
4. Continue moving right, staying above Obstacle 4 and below Obstacle 5.
5. Finally, approach the goal set from above.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point
    (0.5, 0.75),   # Move up slightly to clear the start set
    (0.75, 0.75),  # Move right to clear Obstacle 2
    (0.75, 2.0),   # Move up between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3
    (4.5, 2.0),    # Move right, staying above Obstacle 4
    (4.5, 5.0),    # Move up, approaching the goal set
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Move down slightly to enter the goal set
]

Explanation of changes:
1. The path now avoids Obstacle 3 by moving up between it and Obstacle 2.
2. It then moves right at y=2.0, which keeps it above Obstacle 4 and below Obstacle 5.
3. The approach to the goal set is now from above, avoiding any potential conflicts with Obstacle 4.
4. Each segment maintains a safe distance from all obstacles.
5. The path still starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.

This new path should avoid all obstacles while meeting the requirements of the task.

[09/09/2024 07:09:11 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct, so we can keep those.
2. The main issue is with segments 4 and 5, which intersect with Obstacles 3 and 4.
3. We need to find a way around these obstacles while keeping a safe distance.

Spatial analysis:
1. There's a vertical gap between Obstacles 2 and 3 that we can use to move upwards.
2. We can then move right, staying below Obstacle 5 and above Obstacle 4.
3. Finally, we can approach the goal set from the left, avoiding Obstacle 5.

New path reasoning:
1. Start at (0.5, 0.5) within the start set.
2. Move slightly right to (0.75, 0.5) to avoid getting too close to Obstacle 2.
3. Move up to (0.75, 3.5) to pass through the gap between Obstacles 2 and 3.
4. Move right to (4.5, 3.5) to pass above Obstacle 4 and below Obstacle 5.
5. Move up to (4.5, 4.5) to enter the goal set.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point
    (0.75, 0.5),   # Slight right movement to avoid Obstacle 2
    (0.75, 3.5),   # Move up through the gap between Obstacles 2 and 3
    (4.5, 3.5),    # Move right, staying above Obstacle 4 and below Obstacle 5
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Enter the goal set
]

This path should avoid all obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. It maintains a safe distance from all obstacles and doesn't cross any of them. The linear segments between these waypoints should not intersect with any obstacles.

[09/09/2024 07:09:18 PM] Thank you for the feedback. I'll analyze the situation and provide a corrected path with an explanation of my thought process.

1. Analyzing the obstacles:
   - Obstacle 3 extends from y=1 to y=14 between x=1 and x=4
   - Obstacle 4 extends from x=4 to x=14 between y=1 and y=4
   - There's a gap between Obstacles 3 and 5 from y=4 to y=10

2. Issues with the previous path:
   - The segment (0.75, 3.5) to (4.5, 3.5) intersects both Obstacles 3 and 4
   - The segment (4.5, 3.5) to (4.5, 4.5) intersects Obstacle 4

3. Planning a new path:
   - We'll start from the same point (0.5, 0.5) in the start set
   - We need to move upwards to avoid Obstacle 3
   - Then we'll move right, staying above Obstacle 4
   - Finally, we'll move down to reach the goal set

4. Constructing the new path:
   - Start at (0.5, 0.5)
   - Move up to (0.5, 4.5) to clear Obstacle 3
   - Move right to (4.5, 4.5) to reach the goal area
   - This path avoids all obstacles and reaches the goal set

Here's the new path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point in the start set
    (0.5, 4.5),    # Move up to avoid Obstacle 3
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Move right to reach the goal set
]

This path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles. It moves vertically first to avoid Obstacle 3, then horizontally to reach the goal area, staying above Obstacle 4 and below Obstacle 5. The final point (4.5, 4.5) is within the goal set, satisfying all requirements.

[09/09/2024 07:09:24 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issue is that the second segment intersects with Obstacle 3.
3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 3 while avoiding all other obstacles.

Spatial analysis:
1. There's a gap between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3 that we can utilize.
2. We can go around Obstacle 3 by moving to the right of it.
3. There's space between Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 4 that we can use to reach the goal.

New path planning:
1. Start from (0.5, 0.5) in the start set.
2. Move upwards to (0.5, 3.5) to avoid Obstacle 1 and position ourselves for the next move.
3. Move right to (4.5, 3.5) to pass between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3.
4. Finally, move up to (4.5, 4.5) to reach the goal set.

This path avoids all obstacles while maintaining a safe distance from them.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start point in the start set
    (0.5, 3.5),   # Move up to avoid Obstacle 1 and prepare to pass between Obstacle 2 and 3

This path should satisfy all the requirements:
1. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
2. It avoids all obstacles with a safe distance.
3. The linear segments between waypoints do not intersect with any obstacles.

[09/09/2024 07:09:32 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issue is with the middle segments intersecting Obstacles 3 and 4.
3. We need to find a way around these obstacles while keeping a safe distance.

Thought process:
1. We can start by moving upwards from the start point to avoid Obstacle 3.
2. Then, we'll move right, keeping above Obstacle 3 but below Obstacle 6.
3. Once we're past Obstacle 3, we can move down slightly to get closer to the goal.
4. We'll then move right again, staying above Obstacle 4 and below Obstacle 5.
5. Finally, we'll move down to reach the goal set.

Based on this analysis, here's a new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (0.5, 4.5),    # Move up to avoid Obstacle 3
    (3.5, 4.5),    # Move right, above Obstacle 3, below Obstacle 6
    (3.5, 3.75),   # Move down slightly, still above Obstacle 4
    (4.75, 3.75),  # Move right, above Obstacle 4, below Obstacle 5
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Move down to the goal point (unchanged)
]

Explanation of the new path:
1. (0.5, 0.5) to (0.5, 4.5): This vertical move avoids Obstacle 3 by going up.
2. (0.5, 4.5) to (3.5, 4.5): This horizontal move stays above Obstacle 3 and below Obstacle 6.
3. (3.5, 4.5) to (3.5, 3.75): This small vertical move brings us closer to the goal while staying above Obstacle 4.
4. (3.5, 3.75) to (4.75, 3.75): This horizontal move passes above Obstacle 4 and below Obstacle 5.
5. (4.75, 3.75) to (4.5, 4.5): This final move brings us into the goal set.

This path should avoid all obstacles while meeting the start and end requirements. It keeps a safe distance from all obstacles to ensure no intersections occur.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path are correct.
2. The main issue is that segment 3 between (4.5, 15.5) and (4.5, 10.5) intersects with Obstacle 6.
3. We need to route the path around Obstacle 6 while still avoiding other obstacles.

Spatial relationships:
1. There's a vertical gap between Obstacles 3 and 5.
2. There's a horizontal gap between Obstacles 5 and 6.
3. We can use these gaps to create a path that avoids all obstacles.

New path reasoning:
1. Start from (0.5, 0.5) in the start set.
2. Move upward to (0.5, 14.5) to avoid Obstacle 3.
3. Move right to (4.5, 14.5) to pass above Obstacle 3.
4. Move down to (4.5, 10.5) to pass through the gap between Obstacles 5 and 6.
5. Continue to (4.75, 10.5) to maintain distance from Obstacle 5.
6. Move down to (4.75, 5.5) through the gap between Obstacles 3 and 5.
7. Finally, move to (4.5, 4.5) to end in the goal set.

This path should avoid all obstacles while satisfying the start and end conditions.

[09/09/2024 07:10:06 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids intersecting with the obstacles.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct.
2. The main issue is that segment 3 between (4.5, 14.5) and (4.5, 10.5) intersects with Obstacle 6.
3. We need to navigate around Obstacle 6 while also avoiding Obstacles 3 and 5.
4. There's a gap between Obstacles 3 and 5 that we can use to reach the goal.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Keep the starting point at (0.5, 0.5) as it's within the start set.
2. Move upward to (0.5, 14.5) to avoid Obstacle 3.
3. Instead of moving directly right, we'll go to (3.5, 14.5) to stay clear of Obstacle 6.
4. Move down to (3.5, 10.5) to pass between Obstacles 3 and 6.
5. Go right to (4.75, 10.5) to get past Obstacle 5.
6. Move down to (4.75, 5.5) to get closer to the goal set.
7. Finally, move to (4.5, 4.5) to end within the goal set.

Based on this analysis, here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point
    (0.5, 14.5),   # Move up
    (3.5, 14.5),   # Move right, avoiding Obstacle 6
    (3.5, 10.5),   # Move down between Obstacles 3 and 6
    (4.75, 10.5),  # Move right, clearing Obstacle 5
    (4.75, 5.5),   # Move down
    (4.5, 4.5)     # End point within goal set
]

This path should avoid all obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. It takes a slightly longer route to ensure clearance from all obstacles, particularly navigating around Obstacle 6 which was the main issue in the previous path.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

[09/09/2024 07:10:14 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issue is with segments 3 and 4, which intersect with Obstacle 3.
3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 3 while also avoiding the other obstacles.
4. There's a gap between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3 that we can utilize.
5. We also need to ensure we don't get too close to Obstacle 5 when moving towards the goal.

Proposed solution:
1. Start at (0.5, 0.5) as before.
2. Move upwards to (0.5, 14.5) to clear Obstacle 2.
3. Instead of going directly east, we'll go northeast to (4.5, 15.5) to avoid Obstacle 3.
4. Move south to (4.5, 10.5) to pass between Obstacles 3 and 5.
5. Continue south to (4.5, 5.5) to reach the level of the goal.
6. Finally, move slightly southwest to (4.5, 4.5) to end in the goal set.

This path should avoid all obstacles while maintaining a safe distance from them.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point
    (0.5, 14.5),   # Move up to clear Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 15.5),   # Move northeast to avoid Obstacle 3

    (4.5, 5.5),    # Continue south to the level of the goal
    (4.5, 4.5)     # End point in the goal set
]

This path should resolve the issues with the previous path by avoiding Obstacle 3 entirely and maintaining safe distances from all other obstacles.

4. There's a gap between Obstacles 3 and 5 that we can utilize.

Let's adjust the path:

1. We'll keep the start point at (0.5, 0.5).
2. Instead of going straight up to (0.5, 14.5), we'll go to (0.5, 10.5) to avoid getting too close to Obstacle 6.
3. From there, we'll move right to (4.5, 10.5), positioning ourselves between Obstacles 3 and 5.
4. We'll then move down to (4.5, 5.5) through the gap between Obstacles 3 and 5.
5. Finally, we'll keep the last segment to the goal at (4.5, 4.5).

This approach should avoid all obstacles while maintaining a safe distance from them.

New path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start point
    (0.5, 10.5),  # Move up, staying clear of Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 10.5),  # Move right, positioning between Obstacles 3 and 5
    (4.5, 5.5),   # Move down through the gap between Obstacles 3 and 5
    (4.5, 4.5)    # End point in the goal set
]

This path should satisfy all the requirements:
1. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
2. It avoids all obstacles, including Obstacle 6 which was previously intersected.
3. It maintains a safe distance from all obstacles.
4. The path is represented as an array of waypoints that can be connected linearly without crossing any obstacles.

[09/09/2024 07:10:29 PM] Thank you for the feedback. I understand that the previous path intersected with Obstacle 3. Let's analyze the situation and create a new path that avoids all obstacles.

Analysis:
1. The start point (0.5, 0.5) is correct and within the start set.
2. The direct path to the goal is blocked by Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 4.
3. We need to find a way around these obstacles while maintaining a safe distance.
4. There's a clear path to the left of Obstacle 3, then above it, and finally to the right towards the goal.

Let's create a new path based on this analysis:

1. Start at (0.5, 0.5) within the start set.
2. Move left to avoid Obstacle 3, stopping at (0.5, 0.5).
3. Move upwards to clear Obstacle 3, stopping at (0.5, 14.5).
4. Move right, above Obstacle 3, stopping at (4.5, 14.5).
5. Move down, staying to the right of Obstacle 3 and above Obstacle 5, stopping at (4.5, 10.5).
6. Continue moving down to reach the goal set at (4.5, 4.5).

This path should avoid all obstacles while maintaining a safe distance from them.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start point
    (0.5, 14.5),  # Move up, clearing Obstacle 3
    (4.5, 14.5),  # Move right, above Obstacle 3
    (4.5, 10.5),  # Move down, between Obstacles 3 and 5
    (4.5, 4.5)    # End point in goal set
]

This path should successfully navigate from the start set to the goal set while avoiding all obstacles. It maintains a distance of at least 0.5 units from all obstacles, which should be sufficient to prevent any intersections or close calls.

1. The start and end points are correct.
2. The main issue is the segment between (4.5, 14.5) and (4.5, 10.5), which intersects with Obstacle 6.
3. We need to go around Obstacle 6 to reach the goal.

Let's adjust the path:

1. Keep the starting point at (0.5, 0.5) within the start set.
2. The vertical movement to (0.5, 14.5) is fine, avoiding Obstacles 1 and 2.
3. Instead of moving directly to (4.5, 14.5), we'll go around Obstacle 6:
   - Move to (0.5, 15.0) to clear Obstacle 3.
   - Then to (14.5, 15.0) to go above Obstacle 6.
   - Move down to (14.5, 10.5) to get below Obstacle 6.
4. Now we can safely move towards the goal:
   - Go to (5.5, 10.5) to avoid Obstacle 5.
   - Move down to (5.5, 4.5) to reach the level of the goal set.
5. Finally, enter the goal set at (4.5, 4.5).

This path should avoid all obstacles while reaching the goal.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point
    (0.5, 15.0),   # Move up, avoiding Obstacles 1, 2, and 3
    (14.5, 15.0),  # Move right, above Obstacle 6

    (5.5, 4.5),    # Move down, to the right of Obstacle 4
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Enter the goal set

This path should satisfy all requirements:
1. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
2. It avoids all obstacles with a safe distance.
3. The linear segments between waypoints do not intersect with any obstacles.
4. It provides a clear and efficient route to the goal.

1. The start and end points are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issue is with segments 5 and 6, which intersect with Obstacle 5.
3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 5 while still reaching the goal.

Spatial analysis:
1. There's a gap between Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 5 that we can use.
2. We can go around Obstacle 5 by moving to the left of it.
3. We should keep a safe distance from all obstacles to avoid touching them.

New path reasoning:
1. Start at (0.5, 0.5) as before.
2. Move up to (0.5, 15.0) to clear Obstacle 2.
3. Move right to (14.5, 15.0) to get past most obstacles.
4. Move down to (14.5, 10.5) to approach the goal area.
5. Instead of going directly to (5.5, 10.5), we'll go to (4.5, 10.5) to avoid Obstacle 5.
6. Move down to (4.5, 5.5) to pass between Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 5.
7. Finally, move to (4.5, 4.5) to reach the goal area.

New path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (0.5, 15.0),
    (14.5, 15.0),
    (14.5, 10.5),
    (4.5, 10.5),
    (4.5, 5.5),
    (4.5, 4.5)
]

This new path should avoid all obstacles while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. It takes a wider berth around Obstacle 5 by going to its left side instead of trying to pass on its right side. The path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles to ensure it doesn't touch or intersect with any of them.
