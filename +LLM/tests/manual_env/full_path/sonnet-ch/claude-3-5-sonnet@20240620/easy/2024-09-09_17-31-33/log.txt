# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

[09/09/2024 05:31:38 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and propose a path that meets the criteria.

Analysis:
1. The start position is a square from (0,0) to (1,1).
2. The goal position is a square from (4,4) to (5,5).
3. There are two obstacles:
   - Obstacle 1 blocks the direct path from (2,0) to (4,1).
   - Obstacle 2 is a large horizontal barrier from (-2,2) to (3,4).
4. There's a clear path above Obstacle 2 and to the right of Obstacle 1.

Path planning:
1. Start from the top-right corner of the start square.
2. Move upwards to clear Obstacle 2.
3. Move right to pass above both obstacles.
4. Move down to enter the goal square.

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start at top-right corner of start square
    (1.0, 4.5),  # Move up to clear Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5),  # Move right, staying above both obstacles
    (4.5, 4.5)   # Already in the goal square, no need to move
]

This path:
1. Starts within the start set
2. Ends within the goal set
3. Avoids both obstacles with a safe margin
4. Uses straight-line segments between waypoints
5. Does not cross any obstacles

The path takes a simple "up-right-down" approach, which ensures it clears all obstacles while minimizing the number of waypoints needed.

[09/09/2024 05:32:06 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles.

Analysis:
1. The start position is correct at (1.0, 1.0).
2. The first segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (1.0, 4.5) intersects with Obstacle 2, which spans from y=2 to y=4 and from x=-2 to x=3.
3. We need to avoid Obstacle 2 by going around it.
4. Obstacle 1 is located at the bottom right, spanning from x=2 to x=4 and from y=0 to y=1.
5. There's a clear path between these two obstacles that we can utilize.

Proposed solution:
1. Start at (1.0, 1.0) as before.
2. Move right to (1.5, 1.0) to clear Obstacle 1.
3. Move up to (1.5, 1.5) to prepare for avoiding Obstacle 2.
4. Move right to (3.5, 1.5) to pass between Obstacles 1 and 2.
5. Move up to (3.5, 4.5) to reach the level of the goal set.
6. Finally, move right to (4.5, 4.5) to enter the goal set.

This path should avoid both obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set.

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (1.5, 1.0),
    (1.5, 1.5),
    (3.5, 1.5),
    (3.5, 4.5),
    (4.5, 4.5)
]

This path takes a more careful approach to navigate around the obstacles. It first moves slightly right to avoid Obstacle 1, then up to prepare for avoiding Obstacle 2. It then passes between the two obstacles before moving up and finally right into the goal set. This should satisfy all the requirements while maintaining a safe distance from all obstacles.
