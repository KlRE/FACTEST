# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

[09/09/2024 05:32:23 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll analyze the environment and suggest a path that meets the criteria.

Analysis:
- The start area is a 1x1 square in the bottom-left corner.
- The goal area is a 1x1 square in the top-right corner.
- There are two obstacles:
  1. A 2x1 rectangle at the bottom, between x=2 and x=4.
  2. A 5x2 rectangle in the middle, from x=-2 to x=3, and y=2 to y=4.
- There's a clear path above the second obstacle.

Path planning:
1. Start from the top-right corner of the start area.
2. Move upwards to clear the first obstacle.
3. Continue moving up and slightly right to pass above the second obstacle.
4. Move towards the goal area.
5. Enter the goal area from its bottom-left corner.

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start at the top-right corner of the start area
    (1.0, 4.5),    # Move up to clear both obstacles
    (3.5, 4.5),    # Move right while staying above the second obstacle
    (4.0, 4.0)     # Enter the goal area at its bottom-left corner
]

This path:
- Starts within the start set
- Ends within the goal set
- Avoids both obstacles with a safe margin
- Uses linear segments between waypoints
- Does not cross any obstacles

The path takes a simple and direct route, moving up to clear both obstacles before heading towards the goal. It maintains a safe distance from all obstacles throughout its trajectory.

[09/09/2024 05:32:30 PM] Thank you for the feedback. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles.

Analysis:
1. The start set is a 1x1 square in the bottom-left corner (0,0 to 1,1).
2. The goal set is a 1x1 square in the top-right corner (4,4 to 5,5).
3. Obstacle 1 is a 2x1 rectangle at the bottom (2,0 to 4,1).
4. Obstacle 2 is a 5x2 rectangle in the middle (from -2,2 to 3,4).

The previous path intersected with Obstacle 2 because it tried to go straight up from the start point. We need to avoid this by going around Obstacle 2.

New path strategy:
1. Start from the top-right corner of the start set.
2. Move right to avoid Obstacle 1.
3. Move up to the level just above Obstacle 2.
4. Move left to pass above Obstacle 2.
5. Move up and right to reach the goal set.

Here's the new path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start at top-right corner of start set
    (4.5, 1.0),  # Move right, passing Obstacle 1
    (4.5, 4.5),  # Move up, staying right of Obstacle 2
    (3.5, 4.5),  # Move left, staying above Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)   # Move diagonally to enter goal set
]

This path should avoid both obstacles:
1. It passes to the right of Obstacle 1.
2. It goes above Obstacle 2.
3. It maintains a safe distance from both obstacles.
4. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.

This path takes a slightly longer route but ensures that it doesn't intersect with any obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

[09/09/2024 05:32:37 PM] Thank you for the feedback. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles.

Analysis:
1. The start set is a unit square from (0,0) to (1,1).
2. The goal set is a square from (4,4) to (5,5).
3. Obstacle 1 is a rectangular block from (2,0) to (4,1).
4. Obstacle 2 is a large rectangular block from (-2,2) to (3,4).

The previous path intersected with Obstacle 1. We need to avoid this by going around it. Let's plan a new path:

1. Start from the top-right corner of the start set to maximize distance from Obstacle 1.
2. Move upwards to clear Obstacle 1, then move right.
3. Go around Obstacle 2 by moving up along its right side.
4. Finally, approach the goal set from the right.

New path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),    # Start at top-right corner of start set
    (1.0, 1.5),    # Move up to clear Obstacle 1
    (4.5, 1.5),    # Move right, staying above Obstacle 1
    (4.5, 4.5),    # Move up, staying to the right of Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)     # End in the goal set
]

Explanation:
1. (1.0, 1.0) to (1.0, 1.5): This vertical movement clears Obstacle 1.
2. (1.0, 1.5) to (4.5, 1.5): This horizontal movement stays above Obstacle 1 and to the left of Obstacle 2.
3. (4.5, 1.5) to (4.5, 4.5): This vertical movement stays to the right of Obstacle 2 and reaches the goal set.
4. The final point (4.5, 4.5) is within the goal set.

This path should avoid both obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. The segments don't intersect with any obstacles, and we've maintained a safe distance from the obstacles' edges.
