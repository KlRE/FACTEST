# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

[09/09/2024 05:32:10 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, here's a proposed path that avoids the obstacles and meets the criteria:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point within the start set
    (1.5, 1.5),    # Move diagonally to avoid Obstacle 1
    (1.5, 4.5),    # Move upwards to clear Obstacle 2
    (3.5, 4.5),    # Move right to approach the goal set
    (4.5, 4.5)     # End point within the goal set
]

Explanation:
1. The path starts at (0.5, 0.5), which is within the start set.
2. It then moves diagonally to (1.5, 1.5) to avoid Obstacle 1.
3. From there, it moves straight up to (1.5, 4.5) to clear Obstacle 2.
4. Then it moves right to (3.5, 4.5), staying above Obstacle 2.
5. Finally, it moves to (4.5, 4.5), which is within the goal set.

This path avoids both obstacles by maintaining a safe distance from them. It starts within the start set and ends within the goal set as required. The waypoints are connected linearly, and these linear segments do not intersect with any obstacles.

[09/09/2024 05:32:16 PM] Thank you for the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and provide a corrected path with an explanation of my thought process.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path are correct, so we can keep those.
2. The main issue is that the path segment between (1.5, 1.5) and (1.5, 4.5) intersects with Obstacle 2.
3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 2 while also avoiding Obstacle 1.
4. There's a clear path to the right of both obstacles, so we'll use that.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Start at (0.5, 0.5) within the start set.
2. Move diagonally up and right to (1.5, 1.5) to get clear of the start area.
3. Continue moving right to (4.5, 1.5) to pass to the right of Obstacle 1.
4. Move upwards to (4.5, 4.5) to reach the goal area, passing to the right of Obstacle 2.

This path avoids both obstacles while maintaining a safe distance from them.

New path:
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (1.5, 1.5),
    (4.5, 1.5),
    (4.5, 4.5)
]

This path starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids both obstacles by taking a route to the right of them. The path consists of straight line segments between waypoints, ensuring it doesn't cross any obstacles. Each segment maintains a safe distance from the obstacles to avoid touching them.
