# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

[09/09/2024 05:29:06 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll create a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids the given obstacles. Here's my analysis and proposed path:

1. The start set is a unit square at the bottom-left of the coordinate system.
2. The goal set is a 1x1 square at the top-right, from (4,4) to (5,5).
3. There are two obstacles:
   - Obstacle 1 is a 2x1 rectangle at the bottom, from (2,0) to (4,1).
   - Obstacle 2 is a 5x2 rectangle in the middle, from (-2,2) to (3,4).

To avoid these obstacles and reach the goal, we can:
1. Start from the top-right corner of the start set.
2. Move diagonally up and right to avoid Obstacle 1.
3. Continue upwards to clear Obstacle 2.
4. Move right towards the goal set.
5. Enter the goal set from its bottom-left corner.

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start at top-right corner of start set
    (2.0, 2.0),  # Move diagonally to avoid Obstacle 1
    (2.0, 4.5),  # Move up to clear Obstacle 2
    (4.0, 4.5),  # Move right towards goal set
    (4.0, 4.0)   # Enter goal set at its bottom-left corner
]

This path satisfies all the requirements:
- It starts within the start set and ends within the goal set.
- It avoids all obstacles with a safe distance.
- The linear segments between waypoints do not intersect any obstacles.
- It provides a clear and efficient route to the goal.

[09/09/2024 05:29:16 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start set is a 1x1 square in the bottom-left corner of the space.
2. The goal set is a 1x1 square in the top-right corner of the space.
3. There are two obstacles:
   - Obstacle 1 is a 2x1 rectangle at the bottom of the space, from x=2 to x=4.
   - Obstacle 2 is a 5x2 rectangle in the middle of the space, from x=-2 to x=3 and y=2 to y=4.
4. The previous path intersected with Obstacle 2 in two segments.

Thought process for the new path:
1. We'll start from the top-right corner of the start set to maximize our initial distance from obstacles.
2. We need to avoid Obstacle 2, so we'll go around it from the right side.
3. We'll keep a safe distance from both obstacles.
4. We'll end the path at the bottom-left corner of the goal set.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 1.0),  # Start at the top-right corner of the start set
    (1.0, 1.5),  # Move up to clear Obstacle 1
    (3.5, 1.5),  # Move right, staying below Obstacle 2
    (3.5, 4.5),  # Move up, to the right of Obstacle 2
    (4.0, 4.0)   # End at the bottom-left corner of the goal set
]

Explanation of the new path:
1. (1.0, 1.0) to (1.0, 1.5): This vertical move ensures we clear Obstacle 1 while staying within the valid space.
2. (1.0, 1.5) to (3.5, 1.5): This horizontal move takes us to the right of Obstacle 1 while staying below Obstacle 2. We use 3.5 as the x-coordinate to keep a 0.5 unit buffer from Obstacle 2.
3. (3.5, 1.5) to (3.5, 4.5): This vertical move takes us up to the level of the goal set, staying to the right of Obstacle 2 with a 0.5 unit buffer.
4. (3.5, 4.5) to (4.0, 4.0): This final move takes us directly into the goal set at its bottom-left corner.

This path should satisfy all requirements:
- It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
- It avoids both obstacles with a safe distance.
- The linear segments between waypoints do not intersect with any obstacles.
- The path is represented as an array of waypoints that can be linearly connected.
