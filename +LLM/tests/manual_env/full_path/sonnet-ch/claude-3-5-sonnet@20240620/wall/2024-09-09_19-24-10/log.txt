# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.0, 1.0], [8.0, 1.0], [8.0, -0.0], [9.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate

[09/09/2024 07:24:15 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I've analyzed the environment and planned a path that avoids the obstacle while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point within the start set
    (1.5, 2.0),    # Move up and slightly right to avoid the obstacle
    (4.0, 3.0),    # Continue moving up and right, staying clear of the obstacle
    (7.5, 1.0),    # Move towards the goal, staying above the obstacle's upper edge
    (8.5, 0.5)     # End point within the goal set
]

Explanation:
1. The path starts at (0.5, 0.5), which is within the start set.
2. It then moves up and slightly right to (1.5, 2.0) to begin avoiding the obstacle.
3. The path continues upward and to the right to (4.0, 3.0), maintaining a safe distance from the obstacle.
4. From there, it moves to (7.5, 1.0), passing above the upper edge of the obstacle.
5. Finally, it ends at (8.5, 0.5), which is within the goal set.

This path satisfies the requirements:
- It starts within the start set and ends within the goal set.
- It avoids the obstacle by maintaining a safe distance.
- The linear segments between waypoints do not intersect with the obstacle.
- The path is represented as an array of waypoints that can be linearly connected.

[09/09/2024 07:24:23 PM] HTTP Request: POST https://europe-west1-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/gentle-keyword-432706-b3/locations/europe-west1/publishers/anthropic/models/claude-3-5-sonnet@20240620:rawPredict "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[09/09/2024 07:24:23 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacle.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path are correct.
2. The problem occurs in the segment between (4.0, 3.0) and (7.5, 1.0), which intersects with Obstacle 1.
3. Obstacle 1 forms a diagonal barrier from the bottom-left to the top-right of the space.
4. We need to find a way around this obstacle, either above or below it.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Keep the starting point (0.5, 0.5) as it's within the start set.
2. The second point (1.5, 2.0) is fine, so we'll keep it.
3. Instead of going directly to (4.0, 3.0), we'll go higher to avoid the top of the obstacle.
4. We'll then move to the right, staying above the obstacle.
5. Finally, we'll move down towards the goal set.

Based on this analysis, here's the proposed new path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point (unchanged)
    (1.5, 2.0),    # Second point (unchanged)
    (3.0, 4.5),    # Move higher to avoid the top of the obstacle
    (7.0, 4.5),    # Move right while staying above the obstacle
    (8.5, 0.5)     # Move down to the goal set
]

Explanation of the new path:
1. (0.5, 0.5) to (1.5, 2.0): This segment remains unchanged as it doesn't intersect with any obstacles.
2. (1.5, 2.0) to (3.0, 4.5): We move upward and slightly to the right, avoiding the top-left corner of the obstacle.
3. (3.0, 4.5) to (7.0, 4.5): We move straight to the right, staying above the obstacle. This point is chosen to be higher than the topmost point of the obstacle (4.0).
4. (7.0, 4.5) to (8.5, 0.5): We move diagonally down and to the right, ending in the goal set. This segment should be clear of the obstacle.

This new path should avoid intersecting with Obstacle 1 while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. The path takes a higher route above the obstacle, which should resolve the intersection issue identified in the feedback.
