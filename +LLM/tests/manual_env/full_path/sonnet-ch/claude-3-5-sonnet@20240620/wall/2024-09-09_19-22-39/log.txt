# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.0, 1.0], [8.0, 1.0], [8.0, -0.0], [9.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[09/09/2024 07:22:45 PM] HTTP Request: POST https://europe-west1-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/gentle-keyword-432706-b3/locations/europe-west1/publishers/anthropic/models/claude-3-5-sonnet@20240620:rawPredict "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
[09/09/2024 07:22:45 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I'll create a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids the obstacle. Here's my analysis and proposed path:

1. The start set is a unit square in the bottom-left corner of the space.
2. The goal set is a 1x1 square located at the right side of the space, between y=0 and y=1.
3. There's one large obstacle diagonally crossing the space from bottom-left to top-right.

To avoid the obstacle, we'll need to go either above or below it. Given the position of the start and goal sets, it seems more efficient to go below the obstacle.

Here's the proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point within the start set
    (1.5, -1.0),   # Move right and slightly down to avoid the obstacle
    (7.5, -1.0),   # Move right, staying below the obstacle
    (8.5, 0.5)     # Move up and slightly right to end within the goal set
]

Explanation:
1. We start at (0.5, 0.5), which is within the start set.
2. We then move to (1.5, -1.0) to get below the obstacle, giving it a wide berth.
3. We continue right to (7.5, -1.0), staying well below the obstacle.
4. Finally, we move up and slightly right to (8.5, 0.5), which is within the goal set.

This path should satisfy all the requirements:
- It starts within the start set and ends within the goal set.
- It avoids the obstacle with a safe margin.
- The linear segments between waypoints do not intersect the obstacle.
- The path is simple and efficient, using only four waypoints.

[09/09/2024 07:23:08 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacle while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct, so we can keep them.
2. The main issue is that the path intersects with Obstacle 1 between points (1.5, -1.0) and (7.5, -1.0).
3. Obstacle 1 is a large quadrilateral that spans from y = 4.0 to y = -4.0, and from approximately x = 2.0 to x = 7.0 at its widest points.
4. To avoid this obstacle, we need to go either above or below it.
5. Going above the obstacle seems more straightforward, as it allows for a more direct path to the goal.

Proposed solution:
1. Start from the same point (0.5, 0.5) in the start set.
2. Move upwards to a point above the obstacle, around y = 4.5 to give some clearance.
3. Move horizontally to a point past the obstacle.
4. Move downwards towards the goal set.
5. End at the same point (8.5, 0.5) in the goal set.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start point (same as before)
    (0.5, 4.5),   # Move upwards, above the obstacle
    (7.5, 4.5),   # Move horizontally, past the obstacle
    (8.5, 0.5)    # Move down to the goal point (same as before)
]

Explanation of changes:
1. The first waypoint (0.5, 0.5) remains the same, starting within the start set.
2. We add a new waypoint (0.5, 4.5) to move vertically upwards. This point is chosen to be above the highest point of the obstacle (y = 4.0) with some clearance.
3. We then add another waypoint (7.5, 4.5) to move horizontally past the obstacle. This x-coordinate (7.5) is chosen to be safely past the rightmost point of the obstacle.
4. Finally, we move down to the goal point (8.5, 0.5), which remains the same as in the original path.

This new path should avoid intersecting with the obstacle while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. The linear segments between these waypoints should not cross the obstacle, and we've maintained some distance from the obstacle edges for safety.
