# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.0, 1.0], [8.0, 1.0], [8.0, -0.0], [9.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[09/09/2024 07:23:50 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I've analyzed the environment and devised a path that meets the specified criteria. Here's my proposed solution:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point within the start set
    (1.5, 2.0),    # Move up and slightly right to avoid the obstacle
    (4.5, 2.0),    # Move right, staying below the obstacle
    (8.0, 0.5),    # Move towards the goal set while avoiding the obstacle
    (8.5, 0.5)     # End point within the goal set
]

Reasoning:
1. The path starts at (0.5, 0.5), which is within the start set.
2. It then moves up and slightly right to (1.5, 2.0) to gain some distance from the obstacle.
3. The path continues right to (4.5, 2.0), staying below the diagonal obstacle.
4. It then moves to (8.0, 0.5), approaching the goal set while maintaining a safe distance from the obstacle.
5. Finally, it ends at (8.5, 0.5), which is within the goal set.

This path avoids intersecting with the obstacle by maintaining a safe distance above its lower edge. The linear segments between these waypoints do not cross the obstacle. The path begins in the start set and ends in the goal set as required.

[09/09/2024 07:24:04 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. Let's analyze the situation and adjust the path accordingly.

Analysis of the current situation:
1. The start and end points are correct.
2. The problematic segment is between (4.5, 2.0) and (8.0, 0.5), which intersects with Obstacle 1.
3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 1 while maintaining a safe distance.

Thought process for adjusting the path:
1. The obstacle is diagonal, stretching from the bottom left to the top right of the space.
2. We can either go above the obstacle or below it.
3. Going above seems more straightforward as it aligns better with our current path.
4. We'll add waypoints to go around the top of the obstacle.

Let's adjust the path:
1. Keep the first two waypoints as they are correct and don't intersect with the obstacle.
2. Add a point to move upwards before reaching the obstacle.
3. Add another point to move horizontally past the obstacle.
4. Add a point to move downwards after passing the obstacle.
5. Adjust the final point to ensure it's within the goal set.

Here's the new path with explanations:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start point (unchanged)
    (1.5, 2.0),  # Second point (unchanged)
    (4.5, 2.0),  # Third point (unchanged)
    (5.0, 4.5),  # New point to move upwards before the obstacle
    (7.5, 4.5),  # New point to move horizontally past the obstacle
    (8.5, 1.0),  # New point to move downwards after passing the obstacle
    (8.5, 0.5)   # Final point within the goal set
]

This new path should:
1. Start in the correct start set
2. Avoid intersecting with Obstacle 1 by going above it
3. End in the correct goal set
4. Maintain a safe distance from the obstacle

The path now takes a higher route to avoid the diagonal obstacle, then descends to reach the goal set. This should resolve the intersection issue while meeting all the requirements of the task.
