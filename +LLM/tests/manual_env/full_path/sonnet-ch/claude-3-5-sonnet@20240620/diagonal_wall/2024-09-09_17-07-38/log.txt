# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [

[09/09/2024 05:08:05 PM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I've analyzed the environment and devised a path that meets the specified criteria. Here's my proposed solution:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Move diagonally to avoid Obstacle 2
    (3.5, 3.5),    # Continue moving diagonally, staying clear of Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)     # End within the goal set
]

Rationale for this path:

1. The path starts at (0.5, 0.5), which is within the start set quadrilateral.

2. The second waypoint (2.0, 2.0) is chosen to move diagonally away from the start, avoiding the irregular shape of Obstacle 2.

3. The third waypoint (3.5, 3.5) continues the diagonal movement, maintaining a safe distance from Obstacle 2 while approaching the goal set.

4. The final waypoint (4.5, 4.5) is within the goal set quadrilateral, satisfying the end condition.

This path avoids both obstacles:
- It stays clear of Obstacle 1, which is located below the path.
- It maintains a safe distance from the irregular shape of Obstacle 2 by moving diagonally above it.

The linear segments between these waypoints do not intersect with any obstacles, and the path maintains a buffer distance from the obstacles to ensure it doesn't touch them. The diagonal movement allows for a smooth and efficient path from the start to the goal while satisfying all the given requirements.

[09/09/2024 05:08:12 PM] Analyzing the provided feedback and the obstacle configurations, I can see that the main issue with the previous path was its intersection with Obstacle 2, which is a large quadrilateral that covers a significant portion of the space between the start and goal positions. Let's think through a new path that avoids this obstacle:

1. Starting point: We'll keep the starting point at (0.5, 0.5) as it's within the start set and doesn't cause any issues.

2. Avoiding Obstacle 2: The obstacle is positioned diagonally across the space. To avoid it, we need to either go around its top-left corner or its bottom-right corner. Given that our goal is in the top-right quadrant, it makes more sense to go around the top-left corner of the obstacle.

3. Intermediate points: We'll need to add some intermediate points to navigate around Obstacle 2. We should move up and slightly left to clear the top-left corner of the obstacle, then move towards the goal.

4. Goal point: We'll keep the final point at (4.5, 4.5) as it's within the goal set.

Based on this analysis, here's a new path that should avoid the obstacles:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point
    (-0.5, 3.0),   # Move up and slightly left to clear Obstacle 2
    (1.0, 5.5),    # Move right and up to fully clear Obstacle 2
    (3.0, 5.5),    # Move right, staying above Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Move down and right to the goal point
]

This path should successfully:
1. Start within the start set
2. Avoid Obstacle 1 entirely (which is not in the path's way)
3. Go around the top-left corner of Obstacle 2
4. End within the goal set

The path takes a wider berth around Obstacle 2 to ensure it doesn't touch or intersect with it. The additional waypoints allow for more precise navigation around the obstacle. This path should satisfy all the requirements while avoiding the intersections present in the previous attempt.

[09/09/2024 05:08:20 PM] Thank you for the feedback. I understand that the previous path intersected with Obstacle 2, and I'll now adjust the path to avoid this obstacle while still meeting all the requirements.

Analysis of the environment:
1. The start set is a square from (0,0) to (1,1).
2. The goal set is a square from (4,4) to (5,5).
3. Obstacle 1 is far from the direct path and doesn't pose a problem.
4. Obstacle 2 is the main challenge, as it extends diagonally across much of the space between the start and goal sets.

Thought process for the new path:
1. We'll start from the same point (0.5, 0.5) within the start set.
2. To avoid Obstacle 2, we need to go around it. The most direct route appears to be going above and to the right of the obstacle.
3. We'll add a waypoint to move upward and to the right, staying clear of the obstacle's top-right vertex at (0, 6).
4. From there, we can move more directly towards the goal set, passing above Obstacle 2.
5. Finally, we'll add a waypoint just before entering the goal set to ensure a clear path, before ending within the goal set.

Based on this analysis, here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point within the start set
    (1.5, 6.5),    # Move up and slightly right to clear Obstacle 2
    (3.5, 6.0),    # Move towards the goal while staying above Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 5.5),    # Approach the goal set
    (4.5, 4.5)     # End point within the goal set
]

This path should avoid intersecting with both obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. The waypoints are chosen to provide clear, linear segments that don't cross or touch any obstacles. The path goes above and around Obstacle 2, which was the main issue in the previous attempt.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

[09/09/2024 05:08:29 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start set is a unit square from (0,0) to (1,1).
2. The goal set is a square from (4,4) to (5,5).
3. Obstacle 1 is below and to the right of the path, not interfering.
4. Obstacle 2 is the main problem, as it's a large quadrilateral that blocks a direct path.

The main issue is that the path goes straight through Obstacle 2. We need to find a way around it. Let's consider the shape of Obstacle 2:
- It has a vertex at (-2, 4), which is to the left of our start point.
- It extends to (5, 1) on the right, which is past our goal.
- The top edge goes from (0, 6) to (-2, 4).
- The bottom edge goes from (3, -1) to (5, 1).

To avoid this obstacle, we can go around its top edge. This means we should move up and slightly left from our start point, then move right towards the goal once we're above the obstacle.

Here's the revised path with explanation:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (0.0, 3.0),    # Move up and slightly left to avoid Obstacle 2
    (1.0, 6.5),    # Continue moving up and right, staying above Obstacle 2
    (3.5, 6.5),    # Move right, still above the obstacle
    (4.5, 5.5),    # Start moving down towards the goal
    (4.5, 4.5)     # End within the goal set
]

Explanation of the new path:
1. We start at (0.5, 0.5), which is within the start set.
2. We move to (0.0, 3.0) to start avoiding Obstacle 2 by going up and slightly left.
3. We continue to (1.0, 6.5), moving further up and right to clear the top edge of Obstacle 2.
4. We move right to (3.5, 6.5), staying well above Obstacle 2.
5. We then start moving down towards the goal at (4.5, 5.5).
6. Finally, we reach (4.5, 4.5), which is within the goal set.

This path should avoid both obstacles while starting and ending in the correct sets. It takes a wide berth around Obstacle 2, which was the main problem in the original path. The path now goes over the top of Obstacle 2 instead of through it, and it doesn't come close to Obstacle 1 at all.

[09/09/2024 05:08:38 PM] Thank you for the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and provide a corrected path with my thought process.

Analysis:
1. The start set is a unit square from (0,0) to (1,1).
2. The goal set is a square from (4,4) to (5,5).
3. Obstacle 1 is below and to the right of the path, not interfering.
4. Obstacle 2 is the main problem, as it's a large diagonal obstacle cutting across much of the space between start and goal.

Thought process for correction:
1. The path needs to avoid Obstacle 2 entirely.
2. We can start by moving to the left of Obstacle 2, then up, and finally approach the goal from the left.
3. We need to keep a safe distance from the edges of Obstacle 2.

Let's create a new path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (-1.0, 0.5),   # Move left to avoid Obstacle 2
    (-1.0, 5.5),   # Move up, staying left of Obstacle 2
    (3.5, 5.5),    # Move right, above Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Enter the goal set
]

Explanation of waypoints:
1. (0.5, 0.5): This is within the start set.
2. (-1.0, 0.5): Moving left avoids the diagonal edge of Obstacle 2. We go to -1.0 to keep a safe distance.
3. (-1.0, 5.5): We move up to 5.5, which is above the highest point of Obstacle 2 (6.0) with some margin.
4. (3.5, 5.5): We move right, staying above Obstacle 2. We stop at 3.5 to avoid getting too close to the right edge of Obstacle 2.
5. (4.5, 4.5): Finally, we move down and right to enter the center of the goal set.

This path should avoid both obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. It takes a wider berth around Obstacle 2 to ensure no intersections occur.

[09/09/2024 05:08:52 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct, so we can keep those.
2. The main issue is with the path intersecting Obstacle 2, which is a large diagonal obstacle cutting across much of the space.
3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 2 while also avoiding Obstacle 1.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Start from (0.5, 0.5) in the start set.
2. Instead of going left, we should go right to avoid the diagonal of Obstacle 2.
3. We can move upwards along the right side of the start set to gain some height.
4. Then, we'll move right, staying below the upper edge of Obstacle 2.
5. Once we clear Obstacle 2 horizontally, we can move upwards.
6. Finally, we'll approach the goal set from the right side.

Based on this analysis, here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point in the start set
    (1.0, 2.0),    # Move up along the right edge of the start set
    (3.5, 2.0),    # Move right, staying below Obstacle 2
    (3.5, 3.5),    # Move up, clearing Obstacle 2
    (5.5, 3.5),    # Move right, beyond the right edge of Obstacle 2
    (5.5, 4.5),    # Move up to the level of the goal set
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Move left into the goal set
]

This path should avoid both obstacles:
1. It stays to the right of Obstacle 2's diagonal.
2. It passes well below Obstacle 1.
3. It approaches the goal set from the right side, avoiding any potential intersections.

The path starts in the start set and ends in the goal set, meeting those requirements. By adding more waypoints, we've created a path that should navigate around the obstacles safely.

[09/09/2024 05:09:06 PM] Thank you for the feedback. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles.

Analysis:
1. The main issue is that the path intersects with Obstacle 2, which is a large quadrilateral spanning diagonally across the space.
2. We need to find a route that goes around this obstacle while still reaching the goal.
3. Obstacle 1 is not directly in our path, but we should be aware of it when planning.

Proposed solution:
1. Start from the same point in the start set.
2. Move upwards to avoid the lower part of Obstacle 2.
3. Then move rightwards, staying above Obstacle 2.
4. Finally, approach the goal set from above.

Here's the new proposed path with explanations:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start point, same as before
    (0.5, 3.5),  # Move directly upwards to avoid the lower part of Obstacle 2
    (3.5, 5.5),  # Move right and slightly up, staying above Obstacle 2
    (5.0, 5.5),  # Continue moving right, still above Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)   # Move down into the goal set
]

Reasoning:
1. The first segment (0.5, 0.5) to (0.5, 3.5) moves straight up, avoiding Obstacle 2.
2. The second segment (0.5, 3.5) to (3.5, 5.5) moves diagonally up and right, staying above Obstacle 2.
3. The third segment (3.5, 5.5) to (5.0, 5.5) continues moving right, maintaining a safe distance from Obstacle 2.
4. The final segment (5.0, 5.5) to (4.5, 4.5) moves down into the goal set.

This path should avoid intersecting with both obstacles while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. The waypoints are chosen to give a clear berth to the obstacles, reducing the risk of any line segments between waypoints intersecting with the obstacles.

[09/09/2024 05:09:16 PM] Thank you for the feedback. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct, so we can keep those.
2. The main issue is with Obstacle 2, which is a large quadrilateral that blocks a direct path from start to goal.
3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 2 without intersecting it or Obstacle 1.

Let's break down the spatial relationships:
1. Obstacle 2 extends from the top-left to the bottom-right of the space.
2. There's a gap between Obstacle 2 and the right edge of the space.
3. Obstacle 1 is in the bottom-right corner, not directly interfering with our path.

New path strategy:
1. Start from the same point in the start set.
2. Move to the right to avoid the left edge of Obstacle 2.
3. Then move upwards, staying to the right of Obstacle 2.
4. Finally, approach the goal set from the right.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start point (same as before)
    (3.5, 0.5),  # Move right to avoid the left edge of Obstacle 2
    (3.5, 3.5),  # Move up, staying to the right of Obstacle 2
    (5.5, 3.5),  # Move further right to clear Obstacle 2 completely
    (5.5, 4.5),  # Move up to the level of the goal set
    (4.5, 4.5)   # Move left into the goal set
]

Explanation of the changes:
1. The path now takes a wider route to the right, avoiding Obstacle 2 entirely.
2. By moving to (3.5, 0.5), we ensure we're to the right of the bottom-right corner of Obstacle 2 (3.0, -1.0).
3. Moving up to (3.5, 3.5) keeps us clear of Obstacle 2's diagonal edge.
4. The additional point (5.5, 3.5) ensures we're completely past Obstacle 2 before moving towards the goal.
5. The final two points guide the path safely into the goal set.

This path should avoid intersecting with both obstacles while still starting in the start set and ending in the goal set.

[09/09/2024 05:09:23 PM] Thank you for the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end positions are correct, so we'll keep those.
2. The main issue is with Obstacle 2, which is a large quadrilateral that cuts diagonally across the space.
3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 2 while also avoiding Obstacle 1.

Thought process:
1. From the start point, we can't go directly east as it intersects Obstacle 2.
2. We can go north first to avoid the lower part of Obstacle 2.
3. Then we can move east, staying above Obstacle 2's upper edge.
4. Finally, we can move south-east to reach the goal area.

Let's create a new path based on this analysis:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point within the start set
    (0.5, 3.0),    # Move north to avoid the lower part of Obstacle 2
    (3.5, 5.5),    # Move northeast, staying above Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Move southeast to the goal set
]

Explanation of the new path:
1. (0.5, 0.5) to (0.5, 3.0): This vertical movement avoids the lower part of Obstacle 2.
2. (0.5, 3.0) to (3.5, 5.5): This diagonal movement stays above the upper edge of Obstacle 2. The endpoint is chosen to be sufficiently far from the obstacle.
3. (3.5, 5.5) to (4.5, 4.5): This final movement brings us into the goal set while staying clear of both obstacles.

This path should avoid intersecting with both obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. The waypoints are chosen to keep a safe distance from the obstacles to ensure no touching or crossing occurs.

[09/09/2024 05:09:31 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start set is a unit square from (0,0) to (1,1).
2. The goal set is a square from (4,4) to (5,5).
3. Obstacle 1 is below and to the right of the path, not interfering.
4. Obstacle 2 is the main problem, as it's a large quadrilateral that blocks a direct path.

Let's think through a new path:

1. We'll start from (0.5, 0.5) as before, which is within the start set.
2. To avoid Obstacle 2, we need to go around it. The safest route appears to be going left and then up.
3. We'll add a point to the left of the start, around (-1, 0.5), to begin moving around Obstacle 2.
4. Then we'll move upwards to a point above Obstacle 2, around (-1, 6.5).
5. From there, we can move right towards the goal area, to a point like (4.5, 6.5).
6. Finally, we'll move down to enter the goal set at (4.5, 4.5).

This path should avoid all obstacles while meeting the start and end requirements. Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point within start set
    (-1.0, 0.5),   # Move left to avoid Obstacle 2
    (-1.0, 6.5),   # Move up, clearing Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 6.5),    # Move right towards goal area
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Enter goal set
]

This path takes a wider berth around Obstacle 2, ensuring that no line segment intersects with any obstacle. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set as required. The additional waypoints allow for a clear path that avoids all obstacles while maintaining a safe distance from them.

[09/09/2024 05:09:38 PM] Thank you for the feedback. I'll analyze the situation and provide a corrected path that avoids the obstacles.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct.
2. The main issue is that the path intersects with Obstacle 2, specifically the segment from (-1.0, 0.5) to (-1.0, 6.5).
3. Obstacle 2 is a large diagonal obstacle that spans from the bottom-left to the top-right of the space.
4. We need to find a way around this obstacle while still reaching the goal.

Thought process for correction:
1. Instead of going left and then up, we should go up first and then move towards the goal.
2. We need to stay to the right of Obstacle 2's top-right corner (0.0, 6.0).
3. After clearing the obstacle, we can move towards the goal area.
4. We should add more waypoints to ensure a clear path around the obstacle.

New path explanation:
1. Start from the same point in the start set.
2. Move upwards to clear the bottom part of Obstacle 2.
3. Move slightly right to avoid the top-right corner of Obstacle 2.
4. Move further up to clear the top of Obstacle 2.
5. Move towards the goal area.
6. Adjust to enter the goal set.

Here's the new path that should avoid all obstacles:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point (same as before)
    (0.5, 6.5),    # Move up to clear most of Obstacle 2
    (1.0, 6.5),    # Move slightly right to avoid top-right corner of Obstacle 2
    (1.0, 7.0),    # Move up a bit more to ensure clearance
    (4.0, 7.0),    # Move towards the goal area
    (4.0, 5.5),    # Move down towards the goal set
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Enter the goal set
]

This path should start in the start set, end in the goal set, and avoid both obstacles by going above Obstacle 2 and staying clear of Obstacle 1.

[09/09/2024 05:09:47 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and provide a corrected path with explanations.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points are correct, but the path intersects with Obstacle 2.
2. Obstacle 2 is a large quadrilateral that blocks a direct path from start to goal.
3. We need to find a route that goes around Obstacle 2 while avoiding Obstacle 1.

Spatial relationships:
1. Obstacle 2 extends from the bottom-left to the top-right of the space.
2. There's open space to the right of Obstacle 2 and above it.
3. Obstacle 1 is located in the bottom-right corner, not directly interfering with our path.

Strategy:
1. Start from the start set.
2. Move right to avoid the bottom part of Obstacle 2.
3. Then move upwards to clear the right edge of Obstacle 2.
4. Finally, move towards the goal set.

New path with explanations:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start point within the start set
    (3.5, 0.5),  # Move right to avoid the bottom part of Obstacle 2
    (3.5, 6.5),  # Move upwards to clear the right edge of Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 6.5),  # Move slightly right to approach the goal
    (4.5, 4.5)   # Move down to the center of the goal set
]

Explanation of changes:
1. The first point (0.5, 0.5) remains the same as it's a valid start point.
2. Instead of moving directly up, we now move right to (3.5, 0.5). This avoids intersecting Obstacle 2 and gives us a clear path upwards.
3. We then move vertically to (3.5, 6.5), which takes us above Obstacle 2.
4. From there, we move slightly right to (4.5, 6.5) to approach the goal area.
5. Finally, we move down to (4.5, 4.5), which is within the goal set.

This path should avoid both obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. It takes a wider berth around Obstacle 2 compared to the previous attempt, ensuring no intersections occur.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

[09/09/2024 05:10:02 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points of the original path were correct, so we can keep them.
2. The main issue is that the path intersects with Obstacle 2, which is a large diagonal obstacle in the middle of the space.
3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 2 while also avoiding Obstacle 1.
4. Looking at the coordinates, we can see that there's space above Obstacle 2 and to the right of it.

Thought process for the new path:
1. Start from the same point (0.5, 0.5) in the start set.
2. Instead of moving directly towards the goal, we'll first move upwards to avoid the top edge of Obstacle 2.
3. Then, we'll move to the right, staying above Obstacle 2.
4. Once we're clear of Obstacle 2, we can move towards the goal set.
5. Finally, we'll adjust our position to end within the goal set.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start point (same as before)
    (0.5, 6.5),    # Move up to avoid the top of Obstacle 2
    (5.5, 6.5),    # Move right, staying above Obstacle 2
    (5.5, 4.5),    # Move down towards the goal set
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Adjust to end within the goal set
]

Explanation of the new path:
1. (0.5, 0.5) to (0.5, 6.5): This vertical movement avoids intersecting with Obstacle 2 by moving above it. The y-coordinate of 6.5 is chosen to be safely above the highest point of Obstacle 2 (6.0).
2. (0.5, 6.5) to (5.5, 6.5): This horizontal movement keeps the path above Obstacle 2 while moving towards the goal area. The x-coordinate of 5.5 is chosen to be safely to the right of Obstacle 2's rightmost point (5.0).
3. (5.5, 6.5) to (5.5, 4.5): This vertical movement brings the path down to the level of the goal set. We stay at x=5.5 to avoid any potential intersection with Obstacle 2.
4. (5.5, 4.5) to (4.5, 4.5): This final horizontal movement ensures that the path ends within the goal set.

This path should avoid both obstacles while starting in the start set and ending in the goal set. It takes a more conservative approach by giving a wider berth to the obstacles, which should prevent any intersections or close calls.

[09/09/2024 05:10:10 PM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids the obstacles while meeting all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start set is a unit square from (0,0) to (1,1).
2. The goal set is a square from (4,4) to (5,5).
3. Obstacle 1 is below the path and doesn't interfere.
4. Obstacle 2 is the main problem, as it cuts diagonally across the space between the start and goal.

Let's think through a new path:

1. We'll start from the center of the start set at (0.5, 0.5).
2. We need to avoid Obstacle 2, which extends from (-2,4) to (5,1) diagonally.
3. One strategy is to go around Obstacle 2 on its left side.
4. We'll move left first to avoid the obstacle, then up, and finally approach the goal from the left.
5. We'll add extra waypoints to ensure a clear path around the obstacle.
6. Finally, we'll end at the center of the goal set at (4.5, 4.5).

Based on this analysis, here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start in the center of the start set
    (-2.5, 0.5),   # Move left to avoid Obstacle 2
    (-2.5, 6.5),   # Move up, clearing the top of Obstacle 2
    (3.5, 6.5),    # Move right, staying above Obstacle 2
    (3.5, 4.5),    # Move down towards the goal
    (4.5, 4.5)     # End in the center of the goal set
]

This path should:
1. Start in the correct start set
2. Avoid both obstacles by a safe margin
3. End in the correct goal set
4. Consist of straight-line segments between waypoints that don't intersect with any obstacles

The path takes a wider berth around Obstacle 2 to ensure it doesn't come close to touching it at any point. It also stays well clear of Obstacle 1. This conservative approach should satisfy the non-crossing requirement while still efficiently reaching the goal.
