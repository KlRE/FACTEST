# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[6.0, 7.0], [5.0, 7.0], [5.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[-2.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0]]

			Obstacle 10: [[6.0, 10.0], [4.0, 10.0], [4.0, 8.0], [6.0, 8.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(0.5, -2.75), (0.5, 3.0), (0.5, 8.75)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.

    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[09/09/2024 09:23:00 AM] Based on the provided data and requirements, I've analyzed the environment and planned a path that meets the specified criteria. Here's the path:

new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  # Start within the start set
    (-1.0, 9.0),  # Move up and right to avoid Obstacle 6 and 7
    (0.5, 8.75),  # Pass through a breakpoint from Set 1
    (2.0, 9.5),   # Move further right and up to avoid Obstacle 3
    (4.5, 9.5),   # Continue right, staying above Obstacles 9 and 10
    (5.5, 6.5)    # Move down to end within the goal set
]

Path analysis:
1. The path starts at (-3.5, 6.5), which is within the start set.
2. It then moves up and right to (-1.0, 9.0) to avoid Obstacles 6 and 7.
3. The path passes through the breakpoint (0.5, 8.75) from Breakpoint Set 1.
4. It continues to (2.0, 9.5) to stay clear of Obstacle 3.
5. The path moves right to (4.5, 9.5), maintaining a safe distance from Obstacles 9 and 10.
6. Finally, it moves down to (5.5, 6.5), ending within the goal set.

This path successfully avoids all obstacles, starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and passes through one of the required breakpoints. The waypoints are not always parallel to one axis, providing a more flexible and efficient path through the complex obstacle arrangement.

[09/09/2024 09:23:12 AM] Thank you for the feedback and example. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids obstacles and meets all requirements.

Analysis:
1. The first segment intersects with Obstacles 6 and 7, so we need to find a way around them.
2. We should aim to use the breakpoint (0.5, 8.75) as it's the only one that seems feasible without crossing obstacles.
3. We need to be careful of Obstacle 3, which is in the center of the path.
4. The goal is to the right of the start position, so we should generally move eastward.

New path proposal:

1. Start at (-3.5, 6.5), which is within the start set.
2. Move up and slightly right to (-3.0, 7.5) to avoid Obstacle 7.
3. Continue right to (-1.0, 7.5), passing above Obstacle 7.
4. Move to the breakpoint (0.5, 8.75), which satisfies the breakpoint requirement.
5. To avoid Obstacle 3, move right and slightly down to (2.0, 8.0).
6. Continue right to (4.0, 8.0), staying above Obstacle 9.
7. Finally, move down and right to (5.5, 6.5), which is within the goal set.

This path avoids all obstacles while meeting the start, goal, and breakpoint requirements. Here's the new path in the requested format:

new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),
    (-3.0, 7.5),
    (-1.0, 7.5),
    (0.5, 8.75),
    (2.0, 8.0),
    (4.0, 8.0),
    (5.5, 6.5)
]

This path should satisfy all the requirements:
1. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
2. It passes through the breakpoint (0.5, 8.75).
3. It avoids all obstacles by maintaining a safe distance from them.
4. The segments between waypoints do not intersect with any obstacles.

The path takes a higher route to avoid the central obstacles and uses the upper area of the space to navigate safely to the goal.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.

[09/09/2024 09:23:33 AM] Thank you for providing the feedback. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids obstacles and meets all the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The previous path intersected with Obstacle 6 between points (-3.0, 7.5) and (-3.0, 9.0).
2. We need to avoid this obstacle while still reaching the breakpoint (0.5, 8.75).
3. There's a narrow passage between Obstacle 6 and Obstacle 7 that we can use.
4. We should also consider the position of Obstacle 3 when moving towards the goal.

New path proposal:

1. Start from (-3.5, 6.5) in the start set.
2. Move slightly right to (-3.0, 6.5) to prepare for the upward movement.
3. Move up to (-3.0, 7.5), staying within the start set.
4. Instead of going straight up, move diagonally to (-1.0, 9.0) to pass between Obstacle 6 and Obstacle 7.
5. Move horizontally to (0.5, 9.0), positioning ourselves above the breakpoint.
6. Move down to the breakpoint (0.5, 8.75).
7. To avoid Obstacle 3, move diagonally to (2.0, 7.5).
8. Finally, move to (5.5, 6.5) in the goal set.

This path avoids all obstacles, passes through the required breakpoint, starts in the start set, and ends in the goal set.

new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),
    (-3.0, 6.5),
    (-3.0, 7.5),
    (-1.0, 9.0),
    (0.5, 9.0),
    (0.5, 8.75),
    (2.0, 7.5),
    (5.5, 6.5)
]

This new path should satisfy all the requirements while avoiding obstacles. It uses the space between obstacles efficiently and maintains a safe distance from them throughout the journey.

[09/09/2024 09:23:45 AM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids obstacles and meets the requirements.

Chain of Thought:
1. The current path intersects with Obstacle 6 between points (-3.0, 7.5) and (-1.0, 9.0).
2. We need to avoid this obstacle while still starting from the start set and ending in the goal set.
3. We should also ensure we pass through one of the breakpoints: (0.5, -2.75), (0.5, 3.0), or (0.5, 8.75).
4. Looking at the obstacle layout, it seems easier to go above Obstacle 6 and 7, then come down to the breakpoint at (0.5, 8.75).
5. After passing the breakpoint, we need to navigate between Obstacles 3 and 9 to reach the goal set.

Let's adjust the path:

new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  # Start point in the start set
    (-3.5, 10.5), # Move up to avoid Obstacle 6
    (0.5, 10.5),  # Move right, staying above Obstacles 6 and 7
    (0.5, 8.75),  # Move down to the breakpoint
    (2.0, 7.0),   # Navigate between Obstacles 3 and 9
    (4.0, 7.0),   # Continue towards the goal set
    (5.5, 6.5)    # End point in the goal set
]

This new path should:
1. Start in the correct start set
2. End in the correct goal set
3. Avoid all obstacles by maintaining a safe distance
4. Pass through the breakpoint at (0.5, 8.75)
5. Use arbitrary waypoints that are not always parallel to one axis

The path now goes above Obstacles 6 and 7, comes down to the required breakpoint, and then navigates between Obstacles 3 and 9 to reach the goal set. This should avoid any intersections with obstacles while meeting all the specified requirements.

[09/09/2024 09:23:57 AM] Thank you for providing the feedback. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids obstacles and meets the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The first segment of the previous path intersected with Obstacle 6, so we need to find a way around it.
2. We need to incorporate at least one of the breakpoints from the given set: [(0.5, -2.75), (0.5, 3.0), (0.5, 8.75)].
3. The path should avoid all obstacles while moving from the start to the goal.

New path planning:

1. Start point: Let's start from (-3.5, 6.5), which is within the start set.
2. To avoid Obstacle 6, we'll move right instead of up.
3. We'll aim for the breakpoint (0.5, 8.75), as it seems to offer a clearer path.
4. From there, we'll navigate around Obstacle 3 to reach the goal.

Here's the new proposed path with explanations:

new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  # Start point within the start set
    (-1.0, 6.5),  # Move right to avoid Obstacle 6
    (-1.0, 9.5),  # Move up, staying clear of Obstacles 6 and 7
    (0.5, 9.5),   # Move right towards the breakpoint
    (0.5, 8.75),  # Reach the breakpoint (0.5, 8.75)
    (2.0, 7.25),  # Move diagonally to avoid Obstacle 3
    (4.5, 7.25),  # Continue moving right, staying above Obstacle 9
    (5.5, 6.5)    # Move diagonally to end point within the goal set
]

Explanation of the path:
1. The path starts at (-3.5, 6.5) within the start set.
2. It moves right to (-1.0, 6.5) to avoid Obstacle 6.
3. Then it goes up to (-1.0, 9.5) to clear both Obstacles 6 and 7.
4. It moves right to (0.5, 9.5) and then down slightly to (0.5, 8.75) to hit the required breakpoint.
5. To avoid Obstacle 3, it moves diagonally to (2.0, 7.25).
6. It continues right to (4.5, 7.25), staying above Obstacle 9.
7. Finally, it moves diagonally to (5.5, 6.5) to end within the goal set.

This path should avoid all obstacles, include one of the required breakpoints, start in the start set, and end in the goal set. The segments between waypoints are designed to maintain a safe distance from all obstacles.

[09/09/2024 09:24:09 AM] Thank you for providing the feedback. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids obstacles and meets all the requirements.

Chain of Thought:

1. The first segment of the previous path intersects with Obstacle 7. We need to adjust the path to avoid this obstacle.

2. Looking at the start set, we can see that moving upwards is a better option to avoid Obstacle 7.

3. We need to pass through one of the breakpoints from the set [(0.5, -2.75), (0.5, 3.0), (0.5, 8.75)]. Given the obstacles' positions, (0.5, 8.75) seems to be the most feasible option.

4. To reach this breakpoint, we'll need to navigate around Obstacle 6 and Obstacle 7.

5. After passing through the breakpoint, we'll need to move towards the goal set while avoiding Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 9.

6. We'll aim to end the path in the center of the goal set to ensure we're safely inside it.

Based on this analysis, here's a new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  # Start within the start set
    (-3.5, 9.5),  # Move up to avoid Obstacle 7
    (-1.5, 9.5),  # Move right, staying above Obstacle 6
    (-1.5, 8.75), # Move down slightly
    (0.5, 8.75),  # Move right to reach the breakpoint
    (2.0, 8.5),   # Move right and slightly down to avoid Obstacle 3
    (4.5, 8.5),   # Continue moving right, above Obstacle 9
    (4.5, 6.5),   # Move down towards the goal set
    (5.5, 6.5)    # End within the goal set
]

This path should:
1. Start within the start set
2. End within the goal set
3. Pass through the breakpoint (0.5, 8.75)
4. Avoid all obstacles by maintaining a safe distance
5. Not cross any obstacles

The path takes a higher route to avoid the obstacles in the middle of the space and then comes down to the goal set. This approach provides a clear path that meets all the requirements while maintaining a safe distance from all obstacles.

2. Move right to (-2.5, 6.5) to avoid Obstacle 6.
3. Move up to (-2.5, 9.5) to clear Obstacles 6 and 7.

8. Move down to (4.5, 6.5) to reach the level of the goal set.
9. Move right to (5.5, 6.5) to end in the goal set.

This path avoids all obstacles, starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and passes through one of the required breakpoints.

[09/09/2024 09:24:44 AM] Thank you for the feedback. I understand that the previous path intersected with Obstacle 6. I'll analyze the environment and propose a new path that avoids all obstacles while meeting the requirements.

Chain of Thought:
1. The start point (-3.5, 6.5) is valid and within the start set.
2. Moving directly upward from the start point is problematic due to Obstacle 6.
3. We need to move around Obstacle 6 and Obstacle 7 to reach the upper part of the environment.
4. There's a gap between Obstacle 6 and Obstacle 7 that we can use.
5. After passing through this gap, we can move towards the breakpoint (0.5, 8.75).
6. From the breakpoint, we need to navigate around Obstacle 3 to reach the goal set.
7. There's a passage between Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 9 that we can use.
8. Finally, we can approach the goal set from above.

Based on this analysis, here's a new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  # Start point within the start set
    (-3.0, 7.5),  # Move up and slightly right to avoid Obstacle 6
    (-1.0, 7.5),  # Move right through the gap between Obstacle 6 and 7
    (-1.0, 9.0),  # Move up to clear Obstacle 7
    (0.5, 9.0),   # Move right towards the breakpoint
    (0.5, 8.75),  # Reach the breakpoint (0.5, 8.75)
    (2.0, 8.75),  # Move right to start navigating around Obstacle 3
    (3.5, 7.5),   # Move down and right to pass between Obstacle 3 and 9
    (4.5, 7.5),   # Move right to approach the goal set
    (5.5, 6.5)    # End point within the goal set
]

This path should avoid all obstacles while meeting the requirements:
1. It starts in the start set and ends in the goal set.
2. It passes through the breakpoint (0.5, 8.75).
3. It avoids all obstacles with a safe distance.
4. The waypoints are not always parallel to one axis, allowing for more flexible navigation.

The path navigates the complex environment by using the available gaps between obstacles and making strategic turns to reach the goal while satisfying all constraints.

[09/09/2024 09:24:57 AM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids obstacles and meets the requirements.

Chain of Thought:
1. The current path intersects with Obstacle 7 in its second segment. We need to avoid this obstacle.
2. We should try to continue from the valid subpath: [(-3.5, 6.5), (-3.0, 7.5)].
3. To avoid Obstacle 7, we need to go around it, either above or below.
4. Going above seems more promising as it avoids Obstacle 6 as well.
5. We need to pass through one of the breakpoints. The point (0.5, 8.75) seems the most accessible given our current position.
6. After reaching the breakpoint, we need to navigate towards the goal set while avoiding Obstacles 3, 9, and 10.
7. We can move towards the goal set by going slightly down and then right, keeping a safe distance from the obstacles.

Based on this analysis, here's a new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  # Start in the start set
    (-3.0, 7.5),  # Move slightly up and right (part of the valid subpath)
    (-3.0, 9.5),  # Move up to avoid Obstacle 7
    (0.5, 9.5),   # Move right towards the breakpoint
    (0.5, 8.75),  # Reach the breakpoint (0.5, 8.75)
    (2.0, 8.75),  # Move right, staying above Obstacle 3
    (3.5, 7.5),   # Move down and right, avoiding Obstacle 9
    (5.5, 6.5)    # End in the goal set
]

This new path:
1. Starts in the start set
2. Avoids all obstacles by maintaining a safe distance
3. Passes through the breakpoint (0.5, 8.75)
4. Ends in the goal set
5. Uses arbitrary waypoints that are not always parallel to one axis

The path now goes above Obstacle 7 and Obstacle 6, then moves towards the breakpoint. After reaching the breakpoint, it navigates around Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 9 before reaching the goal set. This path should satisfy all the given requirements while avoiding intersections with any obstacles.

[09/09/2024 09:25:08 AM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids obstacles and meets the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The start and end points were correct in the original path.
2. The path intersected with Obstacle 6 between (-3.0, 7.5) and (-3.0, 9.5).
3. We need to pass through one of the breakpoints: (0.5, -2.75), (0.5, 3.0), or (0.5, 8.75).
4. The longest valid subpath from start is [(-3.5, 6.5), (-3.0, 7.5)].

Thought process for the new path:
1. Start from (-3.5, 6.5) in the start set.
2. Move slightly upward to (-3.5, 7.5) to avoid Obstacle 7.
3. Move right to (-1.5, 7.5), staying above Obstacle 7 and below Obstacle 6.
4. Continue right to (0.5, 7.5), which is close to the breakpoint (0.5, 8.75).
5. Move up to the breakpoint (0.5, 8.75) to satisfy the breakpoint requirement.
6. Move right to (2.5, 8.75), staying above Obstacle 9.
7. Move down and right to (4.5, 7.5) to avoid Obstacle 10 and approach the goal.
8. Finally, move to (5.5, 6.5) to end in the goal set.

This path avoids all obstacles, starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and passes through one of the required breakpoints.

new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),
    (-3.5, 7.5),
    (-1.5, 7.5),
    (0.5, 7.5),
    (0.5, 8.75),
    (2.5, 8.75),
    (4.5, 7.5),
    (5.5, 6.5)
]

This path should satisfy all the requirements while avoiding obstacles and maintaining a safe distance from them.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

[09/09/2024 09:25:19 AM] Thank you for providing the feedback and instructions. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that addresses the issues.

Chain of Thought:
1. The previous path intersected with Obstacle 7 between points (-3.5, 7.5) and (-1.5, 7.5).
2. We need to find a way around Obstacle 7 while still starting from the start set.
3. We should also aim to pass through one of the breakpoints (0.5, -2.75), (0.5, 3.0), or (0.5, 8.75).
4. Looking at the obstacle layout, we can see a clear path below Obstacle 7 and above Obstacle 3.
5. We'll try to reach the breakpoint (0.5, 3.0) as it seems to be in a relatively open area.
6. From there, we can navigate towards the goal set while avoiding other obstacles.

Path Adjustments:
1. Start from a point within the start set, slightly lower to avoid Obstacle 7.
2. Move rightwards and then down to avoid Obstacle 7.
3. Continue moving right to reach the breakpoint (0.5, 3.0).
4. From the breakpoint, move upwards to avoid Obstacle 3.
5. Continue moving right and slightly up to avoid Obstacle 9.
6. Finally, approach the goal set from above.

New path:

new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.25),  # Start within the start set
    (-1.0, 6.25),  # Move right, staying below Obstacle 7
    (-1.0, 3.0),   # Move down, avoiding Obstacle 7
    (0.5, 3.0),    # Reach the breakpoint
    (2.0, 5.0),    # Move up and right, avoiding Obstacle 3
    (4.5, 5.5),    # Continue right and slightly up, avoiding Obstacle 9
    (5.5, 6.5)     # End within the goal set
]

This new path should avoid all obstacles while starting in the start set, ending in the goal set, and passing through one of the required breakpoints. The path takes a more circuitous route to navigate around the obstacles safely.

[09/09/2024 09:25:32 AM] Thank you for providing the feedback. I'll analyze the situation and propose a new path that avoids obstacles and meets the requirements.

Analysis:
1. The first segment of the original path intersects with Obstacle 7, which is located at [[0.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 6.0], [0.0, 6.0]].
2. We need to avoid this obstacle while still starting from the start set.
3. We must include one of the breakpoints from the given set: [(0.5, -2.75), (0.5, 3.0), (0.5, 8.75)].
4. The path should end in the goal set: [[6.0, 7.0], [5.0, 7.0], [5.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0]].

New path planning:
1. Start from a point within the start set, slightly lower to avoid Obstacle 7.
2. Move towards the right, staying below Obstacle 7 and above Obstacle 3.
3. Reach the breakpoint (0.5, 3.0), which seems to be the most feasible option.
4. Navigate around Obstacle 3 to reach the right side of the environment.
5. Move upwards towards the goal set, avoiding Obstacles 4 and 5.
6. Enter the goal set from the right side.

Here's the new proposed path:

new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.1),  # Start within the start set, slightly lower to avoid Obstacle 7
    (-1.5, 5.5),  # Move right and slightly down, staying below Obstacle 7
    (0.5, 3.0),   # Reach the breakpoint
    (2.0, 3.5),   # Move around Obstacle 3
    (3.5, 3.5),   # Continue moving right
    (4.5, 3.5),   # Pass between Obstacles 4 and 5
    (4.5, 5.5),   # Move upwards towards the goal
    (5.5, 6.5)    # Enter the goal set
]

This path should avoid all obstacles while meeting the requirements of starting in the start set, ending in the goal set, and passing through one of the specified breakpoints. The path uses arbitrary waypoints that are not always parallel to one axis, providing a more flexible route through the environment.
