# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Polygon): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this polygon to start the path.
    Goal Position (Polygon): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this polygon to end the path.
    Obstacles (Polygons):    Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.9999999999999996, 2.0], [2.0, 2.0], [2.0, -0.0], [3.9999999999999996, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[2.0, 3.9999999999999996], [-0.0, 3.9999999999999996], [-0.0, 2.0], [2.0, 2.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
[08/19/2024 03:54:41 PM] ```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (2.0, -2.5),
    (2.0, 5.5),
    (4.5, 4.5)
]

[08/19/2024 03:54:57 PM] The feedback indicates that the second segment of the suggested path, going from (2.0, -2.5) to (2.0, 5.5), directly crosses both Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3. 

To rectify this, we need to navigate around these obstacles.  Let's analyze the situation:

1. **Current Valid Subpath:** The path up to the first breakpoint (2.0, -2.5) is valid.
2. **Obstacle Positions:** Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3 effectively form a barrier extending horizontally from x = 0 to x = 4 around the second breakpoint (2.0, 5.5).
3. **Possible Approach:**  We need to navigate around this barrier to reach the goal. Since the obstacles extend further in the negative y-direction, we'll try going above them. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (2.0, -2.5),  
    (2.0, -3.0),  #Slight detour below obstacles
    (5.0, -3.0),  #Moving right, clear of obstacles 
    (5.0, 5.5),  #Moving up to a point above the obstacles
    (4.5, 4.5)   #Reaching the goal area
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

* **(2.0, -3.0):**  This waypoint ensures we clear the lowest point of the obstacles.
* **(5.0, -3.0):** We move horizontally to the right, staying clear of the obstacles.
* **(5.0, 5.5):** We move vertically upwards, surpassing the obstacles' height.
* **(4.5, 4.5):**  We move slightly left and down to reach a point within the goal set. 

This new path avoids the obstacles by navigating around them and should be valid.

[08/19/2024 03:55:12 PM] The feedback indicates that the segment connecting (5.0, -3.0) and (5.0, 5.5) intersects with Obstacle 1.  This makes sense because Obstacle 1 sits right in the path of that straight line.

To fix this, we need to navigate around Obstacle 1.  Here's a possible adjusted path:

**Thought Process:**

1. **Valid Subpath:** We can work with the longest valid subpath provided: [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, -2.5), (2.0, -3.0), (5.0, -3.0)].
2. **Maneuvering around Obstacle 1:**  Instead of going straight up to (5.0, 5.5), we need to move right to avoid Obstacle 1. A good target would be to the right of the obstacle, somewhere like (7.0, -3.0).
3. **Reaching the Goal:** From (7.0, -3.0), we can move up towards the goal area, aiming for a point like (7.0, 5.5) which is clear of obstacles.
4. **Final Approach:**  Finally, we can move left from (7.0, 5.5) to reach the goal set, ending at (4.5, 4.5).

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (2.0, -2.5), 
    (2.0, -3.0), 
    (5.0, -3.0),
