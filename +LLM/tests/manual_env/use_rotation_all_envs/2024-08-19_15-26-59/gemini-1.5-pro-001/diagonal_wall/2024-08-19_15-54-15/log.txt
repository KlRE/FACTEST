# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Polygon): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this polygon to start the path.
    Goal Position (Polygon): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this polygon to end the path.
    Obstacles (Polygons):    Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.9999999999999996, 2.0], [2.0, 2.0], [2.0, -0.0], [3.9999999999999996, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[2.0, 3.9999999999999996], [-0.0, 3.9999999999999996], [-0.0, 2.0], [2.0, 2.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

    ]
    
[08/19/2024 03:54:30 PM] The initial path goes straight up from the breakpoint (2.0, -2.5) and intersects with obstacles 2 and 3. 

To navigate around these obstacles, we need to adjust the path. 

1. **Valid subpath:**  The longest valid subpath from the start is [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, -2.5)]. We'll continue building our path from the last point of this subpath, (2.0, -2.5). 

2. **Maneuvering around obstacles:** Instead of going straight up, we can guide the path to the right of obstacle 2. A waypoint at (4.0, -2.5) would achieve this.

3. **Reaching the breakpoint set:** From (4.0, -2.5), we can safely move upwards to reach the second breakpoint at (2.0, 5.5). To do this without crossing obstacle 3, we'll add another waypoint at (4.0, 5.5). 

4. **Reaching the goal:** Finally, from (4.0, 5.5), we can move horizontally to the left to reach the goal set.

Here's the corrected path:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, -2.5), (4.0, -2.5), (4.0, 5.5), (4.5, 4.5)]
```

    ]
    
[08/19/2024 03:54:39 PM] ## Chain of Thought:

The feedback indicated that the path intersects with obstacles 1 and 2 because the segment connecting (2.0, -2.5) to (4.0, 5.5) directly cuts through them.  We need to find a way around these obstacles.

1. **Analyzing the Valid Subpath:** The longest valid subpath ends at (4.0, -2.5). This point is right next to Obstacle 1, limiting our options to move upwards.

2. **Identifying a New Route:**  We need to navigate around Obstacles 1 and 2 to reach the goal. Here's a possible approach:
    * **Moving Right:** Since going up directly is blocked, we can try moving further right to bypass Obstacle 1 completely.
    * **Navigating Upwards:**  Once we've cleared Obstacle 1, we can move upwards towards the goal, making sure to stay clear of Obstacle 2.

3. **Leveraging Breakpoints:** While the provided breakpoint (4.0, 5.5) leads to a collision, it hints at a possible path upwards. We can aim for a point slightly to the right of this breakpoint to avoid Obstacle 2.

## New Path:

Based on this strategy, here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (2.0, -2.5), 
    (4.0, -2.5), 
    (7.0, -2.5),  // Move right to clear Obstacle 1
    (7.0, 5.5),  // Move upwards, clear of Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)   // Reach the goal 
]
```

This path avoids both obstacles and reaches the goal while passing through one breakpoint from Set 1.
