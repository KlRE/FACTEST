# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Polygon): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this polygon to start the path.
    Goal Position (Polygon): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this polygon to end the path.
    Obstacles (Polygons):    Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[7.0, 7.0], [3.0, 7.0], [3.0, 3.0], [7.0, 3.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 1.5), (5.12, 8.5)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 1.5), (5.12, 8.5)]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.75, 1.75), (5.12, 1.5), (5.12, 5.0), (7.5, 5.0), (7.5, 8.5), (9.0, 9.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Polygon): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 2 between points (5.12, 1.5) and (5.12, 5.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 1: [[7.0, 7.0], [3.0, 7.0], [3.0, 3.0], [7.0, 3.0]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(1.75, 1.75), (5.12, 1.5)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

[08/19/2024 03:27:44 PM] ## Chain of Thought for Path Correction:

The feedback indicates that the second segment of the provided path, going vertically from (5.12, 1.5) to (5.12, 5.0), directly intersects with Obstacle 1. This means we need to find a way to navigate around this obstacle while still adhering to the given constraints. 

Looking at the obstacle's position and the breakpoint requirement, it seems moving to the right of the obstacle is the most efficient way forward. 

Here's the adjusted path and the reasoning:

1.  **Keep the valid subpath:** We keep the first segment from (1.75, 1.75) to (5.12, 1.5) as it lies within the starting set and reaches the required breakpoint.

2.  **Navigate right of the obstacle:**  Instead of going up directly, we need to move to the right, clear of Obstacle 1. 

3. **Proceed vertically:** Once past the obstacle, we can move upwards towards the goal set. 

## New Path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75), 
    (5.12, 1.5), 
    (7.5, 1.5), 
    (7.5, 8.5), 
    (9.0, 9.0)
]
```

This path first moves to the right, clearing the obstacle, then proceeds upwards, and finally reaches the goal set. Each segment avoids crossing obstacles, and the path successfully passes through the required breakpoints.
