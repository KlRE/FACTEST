# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Polygon): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this polygon to start the path.
    Goal Position (Polygon): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 1.0], [4.0, 1.0], [4.0, -0.0], [5.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this polygon to end the path.
    Obstacles (Polygons):    Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[7.0, 3.0], [-2.0, 3.0], [-2.0, 1.0], [7.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 0.0], [-2.0, 0.0], [-2.0, -2.0], [7.0, -2.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, 0.5)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

[08/19/2024 03:37:11 PM] Here is a proposed path that satisfies the given criteria:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start within the start polygon
    (2.0, 0.5),   # Pass through the breakpoint 
    (3.0, 0.5),   # Navigate between obstacles
    (4.5, 0.5)    # End within the goal polygon 
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(0.5, 0.5):**  This starting point lies within the start polygon. 
2. **(2.0, 0.5):**  This waypoint ensures the path passes through the breakpoint of set 1.
3. **(3.0, 0.5):**  This waypoint guides the path safely between obstacle 1 (above) and obstacle 2 (below).
4. **(4.5, 0.5):** This endpoint lies within the goal polygon.

**Visualization:**

If you were to plot this path along with the polygons representing the start, goal, and obstacles, you would visually confirm that this path:

* Starts within the start polygon.
* Ends within the goal polygon.
* Passes through the designated breakpoint.
* Avoids crossing or touching any obstacles. 

Let me know if you'd like me to suggest alternative paths!
