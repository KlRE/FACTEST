# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data

[08/27/2024 01:12:22 PM] The current path fails because it collides with multiple obstacles at the start. We need to find a way around these obstacles to reach the breakpoint (4.8, 0.5). Since the breakpoint lies on the right side of all obstacles with a free path, we can navigate around them by initially moving upwards, then rightwards towards the breakpoint, and finally heading towards the goal set.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),      // Start within the start set
    (0.5, 9.5),      // Move upwards to clear the obstacles
    (4.8, 9.5),      // Move rightwards, staying above the obstacles 
    (4.8, 0.5),      // Move downwards to reach the breakpoint
    (6.2, 0.5),      // Continue moving rightwards
    (7.5, 1.2),      // Adjust slightly upwards to prepare for navigating towards the goal
    (9.5, 2.0),      // Continue towards the goal
    (9.5, 4.0),      // Move downwards 
    (9.5, 0.6)       // Finally, move upwards to end within the goal set 
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles while successfully passing through the breakpoint and ending within the goal set.

[08/27/2024 01:12:39 PM] The initial path went too far up and hit obstacles 3 and 5. We need to adjust it to pass through the breakpoint at (4.8, 0.5) first, then navigate to the goal.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start within the start set
    (4.8, 0.5),   # Pass through the breakpoint 
    (4.8, 2.0),   # Move upwards, staying clear of obstacles 5 and 8 
    (7.5, 2.0),   # Move right, staying clear of obstacle 8 
    (9.5, 2.0),   # Move right towards the goal 
    (9.5, 0.6)    # Move up to end within the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(0.5, 0.5) to (4.8, 0.5):** This segment moves horizontally to the breakpoint, avoiding all obstacles.
2. **(4.8, 0.5) to (4.8, 2.0):** This segment moves vertically upwards, staying clear of obstacles 5 and 8. 
3. **(4.8, 2.0) to (7.5, 2.0):** This segment moves right, safely passing obstacle 8.
4. **(7.5, 2.0) to (9.5, 2.0):** This segment continues moving right, heading towards the goal set.
5. **(9.5, 2.0) to (9.5, 0.6):**  This final segment moves up to end within the goal set, avoiding any potential obstacles near the goal area.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

]

[08/27/2024 01:12:51 PM] The initial path cuts through obstacles 1, 2, and 4. We need to adjust it to navigate around these. 

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Starting Point:** Keep the starting point at (0.5, 0.5).
2. **Navigating Obstacles:**
   -  Instead of moving directly to the breakpoint at (4.8, 0.5), we need to move upwards to avoid obstacles 1, 2, and 4.
   -  Let's aim for a point above Obstacle 1, say (0.5, 9.5).
3. **Reaching Breakpoint:**
   -  From (0.5, 9.5), we can move horizontally to the right, clearing Obstacle 3, and reach our breakpoint at (4.8, 9.5).
4. **Towards Goal:**
   - From the breakpoint, we can move downwards to (4.8, 2.0), safely navigating between Obstacles 5 and 8. 
5. **Final Approach:**
   - Continue moving rightwards to (7.5, 2.0), avoiding Obstacle 9.
   - Finally, move to (9.5, 2.0) and then downwards to (9.5, 0.6) to end within the goal set.

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 9.5),

[08/27/2024 01:13:06 PM] The initial path failed to navigate around Obstacles 3 and 5. To correct this, we can adjust the path to go below those obstacles.  

Here's the thought process for the adjusted path:

1. **Starting Point:** We keep the starting point at (0.5, 0.5) as it is within the start set.

2. **Navigating Below Obstacles:** Instead of going upwards, we will guide the path downwards to go below Obstacles 3 and 5. A good waypoint for this would be (0.5, 0.2).

3. **Reaching Breakpoint 1:** From (0.5, 0.2), we need to pass through the breakpoint (4.8, 0.5).  

4. **Proceeding to the Goal:** After the breakpoint, we can plot a straight path to the goal area, avoiding any obstacles. A suitable waypoint inside the goal set is (9.5, 0.6).

**Therefore, the corrected path is:**

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.2), (4.8, 0.5), (9.5, 0.6)]

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 01:13:12 PM] The initial path failed because it tried to go "under" the obstacles, resulting in collisions. The provided environment seems to funnel paths upwards to navigate the obstacles.

Therefore, the new strategy will involve navigating to the first breakpoint, then moving upwards to avoid the obstacles entirely, and finally, heading towards the goal.

Here is the new path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start within the start set
    (4.8, 0.5),  # Move to breakpoint 1
    (4.8, 8.0),  # Move upwards to a height clear of all obstacles 
    (9.5, 8.0),  # Move horizontally towards the goal set
    (9.5, 0.6)   # Move down into the goal set
]
```

This path should successfully avoid all obstacles:

- It starts and ends within the start and goal sets, respectively.
- It passes through breakpoint 1.
- The upward movement occurs at a location clear of any obstacles.
- The horizontal movement towards the goal is also above all obstacles.

]

[08/27/2024 01:13:25 PM] The initial path failed because the first segment crossed multiple obstacles. I'll adjust the path to navigate around these obstacles.

1. **Analyzing the Obstacles:** Obstacles 1, 2, and 4 create a barrier at the bottom of the environment. The path needs to go above them.

2. **Utilizing the Breakpoint:**  The breakpoint (4.8, 0.5) is useful as it lies to the right of these initial obstacles. We can aim for this breakpoint first.

3. **Navigating Upwards:** To reach the breakpoint, the path can move upwards from the start position, avoiding Obstacle 1. It can then move right, staying clear of Obstacles 3 and 5.

4. **Proceeding to the Goal:** After the breakpoint, the path can safely move upwards, avoiding Obstacle 7, and then right towards the goal, navigating above Obstacles 8, 9, and the cluster of obstacles near the goal.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),      // Start point
    (0.5, 2.0),      // Move upwards to avoid Obstacle 1
    (4.8, 2.0),      // Move right, staying clear of Obstacles 3 and 5, to reach the breakpoint
    (4.8, 8.0),      // Move upwards, avoiding Obstacle 7
    (9.5, 8.0),      // Move right towards the goal, above Obstacle 8 
    (9.5, 0.6)       // Move down to a point within the goal set 
]
```

This new path avoids all obstacles and successfully connects the start and goal sets while passing through the breakpoint.

[08/27/2024 01:13:40 PM] The initial path failed because it intersected with multiple obstacles. The chosen breakpoint (4.8, 2.0) also led to a path that was blocked by obstacles. 

Let's try a new approach:

1. **Start:** Keep the starting point at (0.5, 0.5).
2. **Breakpoint:**  We need to route the path through the only breakpoint (4.8, 0.5).  
3. **Navigating Obstacles:**
    -  To reach the breakpoint, we need to navigate around obstacles 1, 2, 4, and 5.  A safe route would be to first move upwards, then rightwards, and then downwards. 
4. **Reaching the Goal:** From the breakpoint, we can move directly rightwards to reach the goal area.

Therefore, a revised path could be:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start
    (0.5, 2.5),    # Move up, avoiding Obstacles 1 & 2
    (4.8, 2.5),    # Move right, avoiding Obstacles 3 & 4 
    (4.8, 0.5),    # Move down to the breakpoint

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 01:13:48 PM] The current path attempts to move rightwards at a y-coordinate of 2.5, which is obstructed by multiple obstacles. The key is to navigate above these obstacles by utilizing a higher y-coordinate.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

1. **(0.5, 0.5)**: Start within the start set.
2. **(0.5, 9.5)**: Move vertically upwards to a point above all obstacles.
3. **(4.8, 9.5)**: Move horizontally right, passing directly above Breakpoint Set 1, to a point above the breakpoint.
4. **(4.8, 0.5)**: Move vertically downwards to pass through Breakpoint Set 1. 
5. **(9.5, 0.6)**: Move to the end point within the goal set. 

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 9.5), (4.8, 9.5), (4.8, 0.5), (9.5, 0.6)]

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 01:14:08 PM] The initial path went too far up, intersecting with Obstacles 3 and 5. We need to navigate through the obstacles more carefully. 

We can leverage the breakpoint at (4.8, 0.5) to our advantage.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (2.0, 0.5),    # Move right, staying below Obstacle 1 and 2
    (2.0, 5.5),    # Move up, staying to the left of Obstacle 3
    (4.8, 5.5),    # Move right, staying above Obstacle 5
    (4.8, 0.5),    # Move down to the breakpoint, avoiding Obstacle 6
    (9.5, 0.6)     # Move right to the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(0.5, 0.5) -> (2.0, 0.5):** This segment moves rightward, staying clear below Obstacles 1 and 2.
2. **(2.0, 0.5) -> (2.0, 5.5):** This segment moves upward, staying left of Obstacle 3 and ensuring we're above it.
3. **(2.0, 5.5) -> (4.8, 5.5):** This segment moves rightward above Obstacle 5, using the extra space to avoid collision. 
4. **(4.8, 5.5) -> (4.8, 0.5):** This segment moves downward to the breakpoint, making sure to stay to the right of Obstacle 6.
5. **(4.8, 0.5) -> (9.5, 0.6):** Finally, the path moves rightward to a point within the goal set.

This adjusted path avoids all obstacles and utilizes the breakpoint to reach the goal.

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 01:14:20 PM] The initial path crosses Obstacle 1 right at the start. To navigate around this obstacle, we can adjust the path to initially move upwards, clearing the obstacle, before heading towards the breakpoint. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    // Start within the start set
    (0.5, 1.5),    // Move upwards, clearing Obstacle 1
    (2.0, 1.5),    // Move rightwards, staying clear of Obstacle 1 
    (2.0, 5.5),    // Move upwards, heading towards the breakpoint
    (4.8, 5.5),    // Move rightwards to the breakpoint
    (4.8, 0.5),    // Go through the breakpoint
    (9.5, 0.6)     // Move to a point within the goal set 
]
```

This path first navigates above Obstacle 1, then proceeds right and up to the breakpoint, finally reaching the goal set.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.

		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 01:14:32 PM] The issue is that the path tries to move horizontally across the top, but there are obstacles in the way. It's best to navigate a path around the obstacles. Since we need to pass through breakpoint (4.8, 0.5), let's aim to reach that point first. Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 2.5),    # Move upward to avoid obstacle 1
    (2.1, 2.5),    # Move right to a position between obstacles 2 and 3
    (2.1, 7.5),    # Move upward, staying clear of obstacle 3
    (4.8, 7.5),    # Move right towards breakpoint 1, avoiding obstacle 7
    (4.8, 0.5),    # Move downward to breakpoint 1
    (9.5, 0.6)     # Move right to the goal set
]
```

This path navigates around obstacles 1, 2, 3, and 7 to reach breakpoint 1. From there, it proceeds directly to the goal set.

]

[08/27/2024 01:14:44 PM] The current path collides with Obstacle 1 because it attempts to move horizontally across the environment.  A more successful strategy involves navigating above all the obstacles. Let's adjust the path to go upwards, clearing all obstacles, then move towards the goal:

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 10.5),   # Move upwards, clearing all obstacles 
    (4.8, 10.5),   # Move rightwards above obstacles to the breakpoint
    (4.8, 0.5),    # Move down to the breakpoint
    (9.5, 0.6)     # Move rightwards to the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Vertical Movement:** The path first moves vertically to a point above all obstacles.
2. **Horizontal Movement:** Once above the obstacles, the path moves horizontally towards the breakpoint and goal.
3. **Breakpoint:** The path goes through the breakpoint before reaching the goal.

This revised path avoids all obstacles and satisfies the given constraints.

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 01:15:02 PM] The issue is that the third segment is crossing obstacle 5. To address this, the path needs to navigate around obstacle 5 to reach the breakpoint. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set.
    (0.5, 10.5),   # Move upwards, staying clear of obstacles.
    (5.5, 10.5),   # Move rightwards, staying clear of obstacle 5.
    (5.5, 0.5),    # Move downwards, passing the right edge of obstacle 5.
    (4.8, 0.5),    # Reach the breakpoint.
    (9.5, 0.6)     # Move to a point within the goal set.
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Bypass Obstacle 5:** Instead of going directly downwards from `(4.8, 10.5)`, the path now moves further right to `(5.5, 10.5)`, clear of Obstacle 5.
2. **Reach Breakpoint:** From there, it goes down to `(5.5, 0.5)`, then moves left to reach the breakpoint at `(4.8, 0.5)`. 
3. **Final Segment:** The path then proceeds to the goal set.

This revised path avoids all obstacles while meeting the given requirements.

[08/27/2024 01:15:15 PM] The current path fails because it attempts to move directly from the breakpoint to the goal set, colliding with obstacles 6 and 9.  We need to find a way around these obstacles.

Looking at the environment, there's a clear path above obstacles 9 and 10. We can leverage this to reach the goal set.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),      // Start in the start set
    (0.5, 10.5),     // Move upwards, clearing all obstacles
    (5.5, 10.5),     // Move right, staying above obstacles
    (5.5, 0.5),      // Move downwards, clearing obstacles
    (4.8, 0.5),      // Reach the breakpoint 
    (4.8, 8.4),      // Move upwards, staying to the right of obstacle 8 and below obstacle 10
    (9.5, 8.4),      // Move right, staying above obstacle 9
    (9.5, 0.6)       // Move downwards into the goal set
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles:

* It goes around obstacles 1-7 by moving above them.
* It passes through the breakpoint before navigating obstacles 8, 9, and 10.
* It avoids obstacle 8 by staying to its right.
* It avoids obstacles 9 and 10 by staying above them. 
* Finally, it reaches the goal set without intersecting any obstacles.

To circumvent this, we can reroute the path to go around Obstacle 5. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   
    (0.5, 10.5),  
    (5.5, 10.5),  
    (5.5, 0.5),

    (4.5, 0.25), # move slightly left to be clear of Obstacle 5

    (9.5, 8.4),  
    (9.5, 0.6)

```

This path first reaches the breakpoint as before, then carefully navigates around Obstacle 5 before continuing towards the goal.

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 01:15:46 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid the obstacles encountered. Let's analyze the situation:

1. **Valid Subpath:** The longest valid subpath ends at (4.5, 8.4), just before colliding with obstacles 5, 7, and 8. 

2. **Obstacle Analysis:** Obstacles 5, 7, and 8 form a barrier stretching horizontally across the environment.  We need to find a way around them. 

3. **Path Adjustment:**

    - Instead of continuing directly to the right, let's try going down first. This will allow us to navigate below obstacles 5 and 7. 
    - From (4.5, 8.4), move down to a point below obstacles 5 and 7, for example (4.5, 0.25). 
    - Then, move right, staying below obstacle 8. A safe passage would be around y=0.25.
    - Once past obstacle 8, we can move upwards towards the goal set.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  
    (0.5, 10.5), 
    (5.5, 10.5), 
    (5.5, 0.5), 
    (4.8, 0.5), 
    (4.8, 0.25),
    (4.5, 0.25),
    (4.5, 8.4), 
    (4.5, 0.25), # Move down below obstacles
    (9.0, 0.25), # Move right below obstacle 8
    (9.5, 0.6)  # Move up into the goal set
]
```

This new path avoids the obstacles and successfully connects the start and goal sets while passing through the breakpoint.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 01:16:04 PM] The path goes through a series of obstacles after the breakpoint. To avoid this, the path needs to be adjusted to go around the obstacles. It looks like it would be possible to go above obstacles 5, 7, and 8 by making the following changes:

1.  From the last valid waypoint (4.5, 8.4), move further right to a point above obstacle 8, for example, (7.5, 8.4).
2.  Move right and slightly downwards to (8.0, 8.2) to position for the final approach to the goal.
3.  Continue right and downwards, aiming for a point within the goal set, for example, (9.5, 0.6).

Here's the updated path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 10.5), 
    (5.5, 10.5), 
    (5.5, 0.5),

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 01:16:17 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with obstacles 5, 7, and 8. Instead of directly moving right from (4.5, 8.4), we can route the path upwards, then right, and finally downwards to reach the goal set. This strategy leverages the gaps between the obstacles. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 10.5), 
    (5.5, 10.5), 
    (5.5, 0.5),

]

[08/27/2024 01:16:37 PM] The current path collides with obstacles as it tries to cross between obstacles 5, 7, and 8.  We need to adjust the path to navigate around these obstacles.

Instead of attempting to move directly to the right after the breakpoint, let's try navigating below obstacles 5 and 8. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),        # start in the start set
    (0.5, 10.5),       # move upwards 
    (5.5, 10.5),       # move rightwards
    (5.5, 0.5),        # move downwards 
    (4.8, 0.5),        # move slightly left to the breakpoint
    (4.8, 0.25),       # slight downwards adjustment to avoid obstacle 5's corner
    (7.5, 0.25),       # move rightwards, staying below obstacles 5 and 8
    (7.5, 8.2),        # move upwards, clearing obstacle 8
    (8.0, 8.2),        # slight rightward adjustment 
    (9.5, 0.6)         # move to the goal within the goal set 
]
```

This path aims to:

1. **Reach the breakpoint:** The first few waypoints remain similar, ensuring we pass through the breakpoint.
2. **Navigate below obstacles:** By moving rightward at a low y-coordinate, we bypass obstacles 5 and 8.
3. **Clear obstacle 8:** We move upwards to a safe y-coordinate before moving further right.
4. **Reach the goal:** The final waypoints guide us to the goal set.
