# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 1.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 12:15:08 PM] The path needs to navigate between obstacle 1, positioned low, and obstacle 2, positioned high. Choosing the breakpoint (2.0, -2.5) from Breakpoint Set 1 allows for a path that goes underneath the obstacles. 

Here's a possible path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),     # Start within the start set
    (2.0, 0.5),     # Move towards the breakpoint, staying within the start set
    (2.0, -2.5),    # Reach the breakpoint 
    (2.5, -2.5),    # Move slightly away from the obstacle zone
    (2.5, 4.5),     # Move upwards, safely passing below obstacle 2 
    (4.5, 4.5)      # Move rightwards to end within the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Start:** The path begins within the start set at (0.5, 0.5).
2. **Approach Breakpoint:** The path moves rightwards to (2.0, 0.5), aligning with the x-coordinate of the chosen breakpoint.
3. **Breakpoint:**  The path reaches the breakpoint (2.0, -2.5).
4. **Clearance:** The path moves slightly rightwards to (2.5, -2.5), ensuring a safe distance from obstacle 1. 
5. **Ascend:** The path moves upwards to (2.5, 4.5), safely passing below obstacle 2.
6. **Goal:** The path moves rightwards to (4.5, 4.5), reaching the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.

		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 12:15:19 PM] The problem lies in the first segment of the path crossing obstacle 1.  To fix this, the path needs to initially move downwards to navigate around obstacle 1 before heading towards the breakpoint. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (0.5, -0.5),   # Move downwards to avoid obstacle 1
    (2.0, -0.5),   # Move right, staying clear of obstacle 1
    (2.0, -2.5),  # Reach the breakpoint
    (2.5, -2.5),  # Continue right slightly 
    (2.5, 4.5),  # Move upwards, avoiding obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)   # Reach a point within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(0.5, 0.5) -> (0.5, -0.5):**  Move downwards to avoid the top edge of obstacle 1.
2. **(0.5, -0.5) -> (2.0, -0.5):** Move rightwards, staying below obstacle 1.
3. **(2.0, -0.5) -> (2.0, -2.5):** Move downwards to reach the desired breakpoint.
4. **(2.0, -2.5) -> (2.5, -2.5):** Move slightly right to be in a better position to navigate upwards. 
5. **(2.5, -2.5) -> (2.5, 4.5):** Move upwards, staying clear of the left edge of obstacle 2.
6. **(2.5, 4.5) -> (4.5, 4.5):** Move rightwards to end up within the goal set. 

This adjusted path avoids all obstacles while still satisfying the start, goal, and breakpoint requirements.

[08/27/2024 12:15:32 PM] The path needs to navigate around obstacles 1 and 2 to reach the goal. Since the provided valid subpath ends below obstacle 1, we can route the path around obstacle 1 first. 

- From point (2.5, -2.5), move horizontally to the right, staying clear of obstacle 1.  Let's go to point (4.5, -2.5).
- Now, move upwards, staying to the right of obstacle 1. Let's go to (4.5, 1.5). 
- Next, navigate around obstacle 2 by moving upwards to (4.5, 4.5).
- Finally, we've reached a point within the goal set.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
