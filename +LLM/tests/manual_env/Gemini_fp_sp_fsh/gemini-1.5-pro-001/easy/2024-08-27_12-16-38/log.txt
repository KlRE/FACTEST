# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 1.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 12:16:43 PM] The path can be planned by first moving downwards to get past the obstacle directly to the right of the start position. Then move rightwards underneath the top obstacle and finally upwards to the goal position. A path utilising this strategy while passing through the breakpoint `(2.0, -2.5)` is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # start in the start set
    (0.5, -2.5),   # move downwards to pass breakpoint 1
    (2.5, -2.5),   # move rightwards past obstacle 1 
    (2.5, 4.5),    # move upwards
    (4.5, 4.5)     # move rightwards to end in the goal set
]
```

    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.

		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 12:17:00 PM] The issue is that the path tries to go up through a very narrow passage between obstacle 1 and 2. 
 Instead, let's leverage the breakpoint (2.0, -2.5) that conveniently allows us to navigate under the obstacles. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (0.5, -2.5),   # Move downwards to the breakpoint 
    (2.0, -2.5),   # Use the breakpoint 
    (2.5, -2.5),   # Move slightly right to avoid obstacle's corner
    (2.5, 4.5),   # Move upwards, clear of both obstacles
    (4.5, 4.5)    # Move rightwards into the goal set
] 
```

**Explanation of Changes**

1. **Utilize the Breakpoint:** The path now strategically uses the breakpoint (2.0, -2.5) to navigate below Obstacle 1. 
2. **Clearance from Obstacle 1:** By moving slightly right to (2.5, -2.5) before moving upwards, we ensure a safe distance from the corner of Obstacle 1.
3. **Vertical Movement:** The path then proceeds with a vertical movement to (2.5, 4.5), successfully clearing both obstacles. 
4. **Goal Approach:** Finally, the path moves rightwards towards the goal set.

This adjusted path avoids all obstacles, passes through the specified breakpoint, and successfully reaches the goal set.

1. **Navigate around Obstacle 1:** From (2.5, -2.5), we can move further right to avoid Obstacle 1, reaching a point like (3.5, -2.5).
2. **Navigate upwards:** From (3.5, -2.5), we need to move upwards towards the goal set. However, Obstacle 2 blocks the direct path.  We can navigate upwards to a point like (3.5, 3.5), staying clear of Obstacle 2.
3. **Reach the Goal:** Finally, we can move right and slightly downwards to reach the goal set at (4.5, 4.5).

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 12:17:25 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid Obstacle 1. Instead of going straight up, the path can be modified to go around Obstacle 1 from the left. 

1. **Valid Subpath:** The provided valid subpath reaches (3.5, -2.5). We can continue from here.
2. **Circumventing Obstacle 1:**  We need to navigate around Obstacle 1 which occupies the space roughly between x-coordinates 2.0 and 4.0 in the positive y-direction. 
3. **Utilizing Breakpoint:** The breakpoint (2.0, 5.5) lies to the left of Obstacle 1 and above it. We can guide the path towards this breakpoint.
4. **Reaching Goal:** From the breakpoint, we can move towards the goal region.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, -2.5), 
    (2.0, -2.5), 
    (2.5, -2.5), 
    (3.5, -2.5),  
    (1.5, -2.5),  # Move towards the left 
    (1.5, 5.5),   # Go up to the breakpoint
    (4.5, 5.5),   # Move right, clearing the obstacle 
    (4.5, 4.5)    # Move down into the goal set
]

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 12:17:33 PM] The path is invalid due to the intersection with Obstacle 2. To fix this, we can adjust the path to go around this obstacle. 

From the last valid point (1.5, -2.5), we can navigate around Obstacle 2 by first moving further away from it in the negative x-direction and then upwards in the positive y-direction.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, -2.5), 
    (2.0, -2.5), 
    (2.5, -2.5), 
    (3.5, -2.5), 
    (1.5, -2.5),
    (0.5, -2.5),  # Move further left to avoid Obstacle 2
    (0.5, 6.0),  # Move upwards, clear of Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 6.0),  # Move right towards the goal set
    (4.5, 4.5)   # Reach the goal point
]
```

This path avoids Obstacle 2 by taking a detour around it. It utilizes the existing valid subpath and extends it to reach the goal set while adhering to the breakpoint requirement.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/27/2024 12:17:44 PM] The issue is with the segment going from (0.5, -2.5) to (0.5, 6.0), as it attempts to cross obstacle 2. The valid subpath takes us to the breakpoint (2.0, -2.5). From there, we need a path that navigates around obstacle 2 to reach the goal.

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Navigate around obstacle 2:** Since obstacle 2 extends significantly to the left, we can route the path around its right side. 

2. **Maintain clearance:**  We need to ensure the path maintains a safe distance from the obstacle's boundaries.

3. **Reach the goal:** Finally, we need to guide the path to the goal set.

Based on this, here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, -2.5), 
    (2.0, -2.5),
    (2.5, -2.5),
    (3.5, -2.5), 
    (3.5, 2.5),  # Move vertically up, clearing obstacle 2
    (3.5, 4.5),  # Continue vertically to align with the goal set
    (4.5, 4.5)   # Move horizontally to reach the goal set
]
```

This path avoids obstacle 2 by navigating around its right side, ensuring a safe distance. It leverages the existing valid subpath and makes adjustments to successfully reach the goal set.

[08/27/2024 12:17:52 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 1. Since we already reached a breakpoint in the valid subpath, we can continue from there. 

- From  `(3.5, -2.5)`, we can navigate around Obstacle 1 by moving further down to `(3.5, -3.5)` to ensure sufficient clearance.  
- Next, let's move right, passing below Obstacle 1 to a point safe for upward movement like `(6.0, -3.5)`.
- Then, move upwards to `(6.0, 4.5)` to align with the goal set.
- Finally, move left to reach the goal set at `(4.5, 4.5)`.
