# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -0.0], [4.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[3.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 4.0], [-2.0, 2.0], [3.0, 2.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 1.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 12:12:56 PM] A viable path can be visualized by weaving through the two obstacles. Breakpoint (2.0, -2.5) from set 1 is chosen to navigate below the obstacles.

Here is a possible path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (2.0, 0.5),    # Move towards breakpoint, staying within start set
    (2.0, -2.5),   # Reach Breakpoint 1
    (2.5, -2.5),   # Move slightly right to prepare for obstacle avoidance 
    (2.5, 4.5),    # Move upwards, passing between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Move rightwards to end within the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Starting Point:** The path begins at (0.5, 0.5), which is inside the start set.
2. **Approach Breakpoint:** The path moves right towards the chosen breakpoint (2.0, -2.5).
3. **Breakpoint:** The path reaches the breakpoint.
4. **Navigate Obstacles:** The path slightly shifts right to (2.5, -2.5), then moves upwards to (2.5, 4.5). This maneuver allows the path to safely navigate between the left edge of Obstacle 1 and the right edge of Obstacle 2. 
5. **Reach Goal:** Finally, the path moves right to (4.5, 4.5), ending within the goal set.

This path avoids crossing any obstacles, passes through a breakpoint, and successfully connects the start and goal sets.

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[08/27/2024 12:13:04 PM] The proposed path collides with Obstacle 1 right from the start. To circumvent this, we can route the path below Obstacle 1.  Let's try going through the breakpoint (2.0, -2.5) and then navigating to the goal.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (1.0, -0.5),   # Move down, staying clear of Obstacle 1
    (2.0, -2.5),   # Reach the breakpoint below Obstacle 1
    (2.5, -2.5),   # Move slightly right to avoid the corner of Obstacle 1
    (2.5, 3.5),   # Move upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 2

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 12:13:15 PM] The problem lies in the segment going from the breakpoint (2.0, -2.5) upwards. To avoid crossing obstacles, we need to navigate around them. Here's how we can adjust the path:

1. **Starting from the valid subpath**: We can utilize the subpath [(0.5, 0.5), (1.0, -0.5), (2.0, -2.5)].

2. **Going around Obstacle 1**: From (2.0, -2.5), we need to move rightward, clear of Obstacle 1.  A good waypoint could be (3.0, -2.5).

3. **Navigating towards the goal**:  
    * From (3.0, -2.5), we can move upwards to (3.0, 3.5), safely passing between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2.
    * Then, proceed rightward to (4.5, 3.5) to align with the goal set.
    * Finally, move upwards to reach the goal at (4.5, 4.5).

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (1.0, -0.5), 
    (2.0, -2.5), 
    (3.0, -2.5), 
    (3.0, 3.5), 
    (4.5, 3.5),
    (4.5, 4.5) 
]
```

This path successfully avoids both obstacles while passing through a breakpoint and reaching the goal set.

### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/27/2024 12:13:28 PM] The issue is with segment 4 of the path going from (3.0, -2.5) to (3.0, 3.5), as it directly cuts through both obstacles. Let's reroute the path to circumvent these obstacles.

Starting from the last valid point (3.0, -2.5), we can navigate around the obstacles by going east, then north, and finally west:

1. **East:** Move eastward, staying clear of Obstacle 1. Since Obstacle 1's rightmost x-coordinate is 4.0, we can safely move to (4.5, -2.5).

2. **North:**  Travel north to a y-coordinate greater than Obstacle 2's upper boundary (y=4.0). We can choose (4.5, 4.5) to be safe.

3. **West:**  Finally, move westward towards the goal set. We can connect directly to a point within the goal set, like (4.5, 4.5).

Therefore, a revised path could be:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (1.0, -0.5), (2.0, -2.5), (3.0, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (4.5, 4.5), (4.5, 4.5)]
```

This path avoids both obstacles while starting and ending in the designated sets and passing through a breakpoint.
