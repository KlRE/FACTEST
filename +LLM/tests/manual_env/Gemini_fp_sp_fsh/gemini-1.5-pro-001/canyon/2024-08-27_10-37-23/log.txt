# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -1.58), (2.0, 1.72)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 10:37:38 AM] By visualizing the provided data, we can identify a suitable path:

1. **Start:** Begin within the start set at point (-0.25, 0.5).
2. **Navigate around Obstacle 2:** Move down and to the right, passing below and to the right of Obstacle 2. 
3. **Pass through Breakpoint Set 1:** Continue moving rightwards and slightly downwards, passing through the first breakpoint of Breakpoint Set 1 at (2.0, -1.58).
4. **Approach Goal Set:** Curve upwards and to the right, avoiding Obstacle 1 and approaching the goal set.
5. **End:** Finally, enter the goal set and end at point (3.2, 2.5).

Therefore, a possible representation of this path using waypoints is:

```
new_path = [
    (-0.25, 0.5),
    (0.5, -0.5),
    (2.0, -1.58),
    (2.5, -1.0),
    (3.0, 0.0), 
    (3.2, 2.5) 
]
``` 

This is just one possible path, and other solutions may exist. It's important to visually verify that this path avoids all obstacles and fulfills all the given requirements.

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 10:37:55 AM] The initial path attempts to cut across the environment, leading to a collision with Obstacle 2.  We should aim to navigate around the obstacles strategically. 

Given the layout of the obstacles,  it seems more efficient to go around Obstacle 2 by moving below it. Since we need to pass through a breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1, let's choose the breakpoint (2.0, -1.58). 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-0.25, 0.5),   // Start within the start set
    (0.5, 0.0),    // Move slightly right and down, staying above Obstacle 2
    (1.0, -1.0),   // Continue moving right and down, preparing to navigate below Obstacle 2
    (2.0, -1.58),  // Pass through the chosen breakpoint 
    (2.5, -1.0),   // Move slightly right and up, clearing Obstacle 2 
    (3.0, 0.0),    // Continue moving right and upwards
    (3.2, 2.5)    // Arrive within the goal set
]
```

This new path aims to go around Obstacle 2 by dipping below it, ensuring it passes through a breakpoint while navigating towards the goal set.

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 10:38:07 AM] The initial path attempts to cut through obstacle 2. The path needs to be adjusted to navigate around this obstacle. A viable approach is to route the path below obstacle 2, utilizing the provided breakpoint (2.0, -1.58).

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-0.25, 0.5),  # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Move slightly to the right 
    (1.0, 0.0),   # Move downwards 
    (2.0, -1.58),  # Reach the breakpoint below obstacle 2
    (2.5, -1.0),  # Move slightly upwards
    (3.0, 0.0),   # Continue moving upwards
    (3.2, 2.5)   # Reach a point within the goal set
]
```

This adjusted path avoids obstacle 2 by going below it. It maintains a safe distance from the obstacle, ensuring it does not intersect. The path also fulfills the requirement of passing through a breakpoint from Set 1.

Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 10:38:23 AM] The path needs to navigate around Obstacle 2 to reach the goal. The provided path attempts to go below the obstacle, but the second segment crosses the obstacle. Instead, let's try going above and around it. 

We can achieve this by adjusting the path as follows:

1. **Continue from the valid subpath:** Keep the first waypoint  (-0.25, 0.5).

2. **Navigate upwards:** Since the obstacle extends far to the right, guide the path upwards before moving towards the goal set. A waypoint around (0.5, 2.0) should be sufficiently above the obstacle.

3. **Approach breakpoint:** Aim for the breakpoint (2.0, 1.72) from the top. 

4. **Proceed to the goal:** From the breakpoint, the path can move towards the goal set without crossing any obstacles. A final waypoint around (3.2, 2.5) should suffice.

Therefore, a corrected path could be:

```
new_path = [(-0.25, 0.5), (0.5, 2.0), (2.0, 1.72), (3.2, 2.5)]
```

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 10:38:52 AM] The current path attempts to move leftward and then straight down to the breakpoint. This causes an intersection with Obstacle 2. Instead, we should try to reach the breakpoint by first navigating below Obstacle 2.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-0.25, 0.5),   # Start within the start set
    (-0.25, -1.0),  # Move down, staying clear of Obstacle 2
    (2.0, -1.58),   # Move right to the breakpoint, staying below Obstacle 2
    (3.2, -1.58),   # Continue moving right, staying below Obstacle 2 
    (3.2, 2.5)    # Move upward to the goal set, avoiding Obstacle 1 
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Initial Downward Movement:** The first two waypoints move the path directly south, keeping it safely to the left of Obstacle 2. 
2. **Reaching the Breakpoint:**  The path then moves directly east towards the breakpoint (2.0, -1.58), staying below the bottom corner of Obstacle 2.
3. **Continuing East:** To avoid a collision with Obstacle 1, the path continues eastward before turning north. 
4. **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, the path moves north to reach the goal set while staying clear of Obstacle 1.

This new path respects the constraints of the problem, starting and ending in the correct sets, passing through a breakpoint, and successfully avoiding any collisions with obstacles.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 10:39:03 AM] The current path collides with Obstacle 2 almost immediately. Let's adjust the path to avoid this. Instead of going straight down, we can try navigating around Obstacle 2.

1. **Start:** We can keep the starting point of (-0.25, 0.5).
2. **Navigate Right:**  Move rightwards towards the right edge of Obstacle 2. A possible waypoint could be (6.5, 0.5).
3. **Navigate Upwards:** Move upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 2's upper edge.  A waypoint like (6.5, 4.0) could work.
4. **Reach Breakpoint:** From here, we need to reach the breakpoint (2.0, 1.72). To avoid backtracking through potentially dangerous areas, let's loop around the top. A waypoint like (6.5, 6.0) gets us clear.
5. **Approach Breakpoint:** Now we can safely approach the breakpoint from above: (2.0, 6.0).
6. **Hit Breakpoint:**  We're finally at the breakpoint: (2.0, 1.72).
7. **Reach Goal:** The final step is to navigate from the breakpoint to the goal set. A possible endpoint within the goal set is (3.46, 2.5).

Therefore, the updated path is:

```
new_path = [

    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -1.58), (2.0, 1.72)]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(-0.25, 0.5), (6.5, 0.5), (6.5, 4.0), (6.5, 6.0), (2.0, 6.0), (2.0, 1.72), (3.46, 2.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 1 between points (-0.25, 0.5) and (6.5, 0.5) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(-0.25, 0.5)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 10:39:17 AM] The initial path attempts to cross Obstacle 2 with a straight line, which fails. We need to find a way around this obstacle. 

Let's try going below it.

From the valid subpath start point (-0.25, 0.5), we can move down, then right, and then up to the first breakpoint:

new_path = [
    (-0.25, 0.5), 
    (-0.25, -1.0), 
    (2.0, -1.0), 
    (2.0, -1.58),  # Breakpoint Set 1
    (2.0, 1.72),  # Breakpoint Set 1 - try this one in case the previous leads to a dead end
    (3.46, 2.5)   # Goal set

]

[08/27/2024 10:39:34 AM] The initial path attempts to move downwards, leading to a collision with Obstacle 2. Instead, let's try moving towards Breakpoint Set 1 while staying clear of the obstacles.

1. **Start:** We can start at the same point (-0.25, 0.5). 
2. **Navigate around Obstacle 2:** We need to move rightward to avoid Obstacle 2. A good waypoint would be (1.0, 0.5).
3. **Approach Breakpoint Set 1:** From (1.0, 0.5) we can head towards the first breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1, which is (2.0, -1.58).
4. **Towards the Goal:**  From this breakpoint, we can safely move towards the goal area, avoiding any intersections with obstacles. A suitable waypoint is (2.5, 2.0) before moving to the final destination.
5. **End:** Finally, we can pick a point within the goal set, such as (3.46, 2.5), as our endpoint.

**New Path:**

Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 10:39:46 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 2. Looking at the positions of the breakpoints of set 1, the breakpoint (2.0, 1.72) seems promising. A path can be constructed that goes around Obstacle 2 by passing above it. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-0.25, 0.5),  # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Move slightly to the right
    (0.5, 2.0),   # Move upwards, going around Obstacle 2
    (2.0, 1.72),  # Pass through the breakpoint 
    (2.5, 2.0),   # Move slightly to the right
    (3.46, 2.5)   # End within the goal set

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -1.58), (2.0, 1.72)]

## Your generated path:

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 2 between points (0.5, 0.5) and (0.5, 2.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(-0.25, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[08/27/2024 10:39:56 AM] The path needs to navigate around Obstacle 1 to reach the goal. The provided valid subpath gets us past the concave part of Obstacle 1. From there, we can go above Obstacle 1 and then proceed towards the goal.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 10:40:12 AM] The current path collides with Obstacle 1 because it attempts to move directly upwards from the start set. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle. 

One way to do this is to initially move towards the right, skirting below Obstacle 1, and then proceed upwards towards Breakpoint Set 1. After passing through the breakpoint, the path can then head towards the goal set.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-0.25, 0.5),  # Start within the start set
    (1.0, 0.5),    # Move right, staying below Obstacle 1
    (2.0, -1.58),   # Pass through the lower breakpoint of Breakpoint Set 1
    (2.5, 0.0),    # Move upward, clearing Obstacle 1
    (2.5, 2.5),    # Continue upward
    (3.46, 2.5)   # End within the goal set 
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles:

* **Segment 1:** Moves rightward, staying clear of Obstacle 1.
* **Segment 2:** Moves diagonally downward to the breakpoint, avoiding both obstacles.
* **Segment 3:** Moves upward, safely passing Obstacle 1 on the right.
* **Segment 4 & 5:** Moves upward and rightward, directly to the goal set without encountering any obstacles.

## Example
### Provided Data

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 10:40:42 AM] The initial path segment crosses obstacle 2. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle. 

One approach is to route the path above obstacle 2, leveraging the available space.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-0.25, 0.5),   # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 1.5),    # Move upwards, staying clear of obstacle 2
    (2.0, 1.72),   # Pass through the upper breakpoint of Set 1
    (2.5, 1.5),    # Continue rightward
    (3.0, 2.0),    # Adjust trajectory towards the goal set
    (3.46, 2.5)    # End within the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Initial Ascent:** The path first moves upward to (0.5, 1.5) to clear the top of obstacle 2. 
2. **Breakpoint Passage:** It then proceeds to the upper breakpoint of Set 1 (2.0, 1.72).
3. **Rightward Movement:** The path continues rightward to (2.5, 1.5), maintaining a safe distance from obstacle 2.
4. **Goal Approach:** Finally, the path adjusts its trajectory, moving towards the goal set and ending at (3.46, 2.5).

This new path avoids intersecting any obstacles while fulfilling the requirements of starting and ending within the specified sets and passing through a breakpoint.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 10:40:55 AM] The initial path attempt intersects with Obstacle 1 very early on. To circumvent this, we can route the path beneath Obstacle 1.  Let's aim to pass below Obstacle 1 by leveraging the provided breakpoint (2.0, -1.58). From there, we can navigate towards the goal set. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-0.25, 0.5),  # Starting inside the start set
    (0.5, 0.0),   # Dipping down, staying clear of Obstacle 1
    (2.0, -1.58),  # Passing through Breakpoint Set 1 
    (2.5, -1.0),  # Maintaining a safe distance from Obstacle 1's corner
    (3.0, 0.0),   # Gradually moving upwards
    (3.46, 2.5)   # Reaching the goal set 
]
```

This adjusted path aims to avoid Obstacle 1 by going underneath it, utilizing the provided breakpoint to navigate around the obstacle and then proceed towards the goal set.

Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 10:41:25 AM] The initial path crosses obstacle 2 because it goes down directly south. It needs to navigate around this obstacle. 

One approach is to use the provided breakpoint (2.0, -1.58) to go around obstacle 2. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-0.25, 0.5),   # Start inside the start set
    (1.0, 0.5),     # Move right, staying clear of obstacle 2
    (1.0, -1.58),   # Move down to the breakpoint, clear of obstacle 2 
    (2.0, -1.58),   # Continue to the breakpoint
    (2.5, -1.0),   # Move slightly right and up, staying clear of obstacle 2
    (3.0, 0.0),     # Continue right, still clear of obstacle 2
    (3.46, 2.5)    # Move to the final position inside the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Initial Rightward Movement:** Instead of going down directly, the path starts by moving right to (1.0, 0.5). This ensures a safe distance from obstacle 2.

2. **Utilizing the Breakpoint:** The path then moves down to the breakpoint (2.0, -1.58). This maneuver takes advantage of the open space offered by the breakpoint's location.

3. **Careful Approach to the Goal:** From the breakpoint, the path gradually shifts right and up, carefully navigating around the bottom-right corner of obstacle 2 before proceeding towards the goal. 

This revised path avoids all obstacles and successfully connects the start and goal sets by strategically using a breakpoint.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -1.58), (2.0, 1.72)]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(-0.25, 0.5), (1.0, 0.5), (1.0, -1.58), (2.0, -1.58), (2.5, -1.0), (3.0, 0.0), (3.46, 2.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 1 between points (-0.25, 0.5) and (1.0, 0.5) intersects with obstacle(s):

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(-0.25, 0.5)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 10:41:41 AM] The initial path goes through obstacle 2. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle. One option is to go below it.

- The valid subpath ends at (-0.25, 0.5).
- From there, we can move downwards to ( -0.25, -1.0) to avoid obstacle 2. 
- Then, we can move towards breakpoint (2.0, -1.58): (2.0, -1.0) -> (2.0, -1.58).
- From this breakpoint, we can head towards the goal set while staying below obstacle 2. A possible route is: (2.5, -1.58) -> (3.0, -1.0) -> (3.46, 2.0).

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [(-0.25, 0.5), (-0.25, -1.0), (2.0, -1.0), (2.0, -1.58), (2.5, -1.58), (3.0, -1.0), (3.46, 2.0)]

]

[08/27/2024 10:42:10 AM] The initial path failed because it directly intersected obstacle 2.  Therefore, a different strategy is needed to navigate around the obstacles.

1. **Starting Point:** I'll keep the starting point at (-0.25, 0.5) inside the start set.

2. **Navigating Obstacles:**
   - I need to guide the path above the top vertex of obstacle 2 which is at (6.06, 3.5). This could be achieved by aiming for a point with a y-coordinate greater than 3.5. 
   - Simultaneously, I need to stay clear of obstacle 1. A safe passage seems to be going "south" and then maneuvering around the right side of obstacle 1.

3. **Breakpoint:**  The path must pass through one of the breakpoints in Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -1.58), (2.0, 1.72)]. Looking at the obstacle positions, (2.0, -1.58) seems like a better choice to facilitate a smoother path around obstacle 1.

4. **Reaching the Goal:** After passing through the breakpoint and safely navigating around obstacle 1,  I can direct the path towards the goal set.

Based on this thought process, here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-0.25, 0.5),     // Start Point
    (1.0, 0.5),       // Move right, staying above obstacle 2
    (2.0, 0.5),       // Continue right towards the breakpoint
