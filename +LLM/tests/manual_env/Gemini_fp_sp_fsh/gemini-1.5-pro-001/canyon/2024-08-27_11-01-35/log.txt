# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.96, 2.87], [3.46, 2.0], [4.33, 2.5], [3.83, 3.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-1.73, -1.0], [-0.73, -2.73], [7.06, 1.77], [6.06, 3.5]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -1.58), (2.0, 1.72)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 11:01:50 AM] A path can be created by navigating between the two obstacles, leveraging the breakpoint set as a guide. 

1. **Start:** Begin within the start quadrilateral, for instance, at point (-0.25, 0.5).
2. **Navigate Around Obstacle 2:** Move downwards and towards the right, carefully avoiding the lower edge of Obstacle 2. A suitable waypoint could be (1.5, 0.75).
3. **Pass Through Breakpoint:** Continue moving rightwards and slightly downwards to pass through the first breakpoint of Set 1, (2.0, -1.58).
4. **Maneuver Between Obstacles:** Proceed rightwards, maintaining a safe distance from the corners of both Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2. A possible waypoint is (2.5, 0).
5. **Reach Goal Area:** Finally, navigate upwards towards the goal quadrilateral, reaching a point within its boundaries, such as (3.5, 2.5).

Therefore, a possible path is:

```
new_path = [
    (-0.25, 0.5),
    (1.5, 0.75),
    (2.0, -1.58),
    (2.5, 0), 
    (3.5, 2.5)
] 
```

This path successfully avoids all obstacles, passes through a breakpoint, and connects the start and goal areas.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 11:02:08 AM] The issue lies in the very first segment of the path. It tries to move directly from the start set to the breakpoint, intersecting with Obstacle 2. A viable approach is to navigate around the obstacle by first moving upwards, then sideways, and finally reaching the breakpoint. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-0.25, 0.5),   # Start within the start set
    (-0.25, 2.0),   # Move upwards to avoid Obstacle 2
    (2.0, 2.0),    # Move rightwards above Obstacle 2
    (2.0, -1.58),  # Reach the breakpoint 
    (2.5, 0.0),    # Continue towards the goal set
    (3.5, 2.5)     # End within the goal set
]
```

This path avoids Obstacle 2 by first moving upwards, then rightwards above the obstacle, before reaching the breakpoint and continuing to the goal set.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 11:02:21 AM] The initial path attempts to move upwards directly from the start set. This is problematic because of the shape of Obstacle 1, which extends far to the left and creates a kind of "wall" that the original path cannot overcome. 

To circumvent this, the path needs to first navigate towards the right side of the environment, before moving upwards to pass Breakpoint Set 1. Since the goal is located on the right side of the environment as well, this approach is more promising.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0),    # Start within the start set
    (2.5, 0.0),    # Move rightwards, staying below Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2
    (2.0, -1.58),  # Pass through the lower breakpoint of Breakpoint Set 1 
    (3.0, -1.58),  # Continue moving rightwards
    (3.5, 2.5)     # Move upwards to end within the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Initial Rightward Movement:** The path first navigates to the right, staying below Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2. This maneuver avoids the immediate collision with Obstacle 1.
2. **Breakpoint Passage:** The path then curves upwards to pass through the lower breakpoint of Breakpoint Set 1. Choosing the lower breakpoint is strategic as it allows the path to remain below Obstacle 2.
3. **Final Approach:** After clearing the breakpoint, the path continues moving right to a point where it can safely move upwards and reach the goal set without intersecting any obstacles. 

This adjusted path addresses the obstacle collision issue present in the original path while adhering to all other requirements.

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 11:02:31 AM] The initial path segment crosses obstacle 2. To circumvent this, the path needs to navigate around the obstacle. A viable approach involves directing the path upwards, clearing the upper boundary of obstacle 2, and then proceeding rightward towards the goal. Let's adjust the path as follows:

new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0),  # Start within the start set
    (0.0, 4.0),  # Move upwards to clear obstacle 2
    (2.0, 4.0),  # Move rightward, staying above obstacle 2
    (2.0, 1.72),  # Pass through the breakpoint 
    (3.5, 2.5)   # Proceed to a point within the goal set

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-0.5, 0.87], [-0.0, -0.0], [0.87, 0.5], [0.37, 1.37]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.56, 6.1], [-3.23, 1.6], [-2.23, -0.13], [5.56, 4.37]]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.0, 0.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 11:02:50 AM] The initial path attempts to move directly upwards from the start position, immediately colliding with both obstacles. We need a path that navigates around the obstacles to reach the goal position.

Let's analyze the environment:

- **Obstacle 1** extends vertically across the positive x-axis, while **Obstacle 2**  covers a large area across both positive and negative x-axis.
- There's a noticeable gap between the bottom edge of Obstacle 1 and the top edge of Obstacle 2, particularly around the x-coordinate 2.0. This gap aligns with Breakpoint Set 1.

Considering this analysis, we can design the following path:

1. **Start at (0.0, 0.0):** This point lies within the start set.
2. **Move to (2.0, -1.58):**  This directs us towards Breakpoint Set 1, safely navigating below Obstacle 2.
3. **Proceed to (2.0, 1.72):**  This takes us through the gap between the obstacles, utilizing the breakpoint. 
4. **Move towards  (3.5, 2.5):** This sets us on a trajectory towards the goal set. 

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0),
    (2.0, -1.58),
    (2.0, 1.72),
    (3.5, 2.5) 
]

]

[08/27/2024 11:03:15 AM] The initial path goes straight up, crossing both obstacles. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around the obstacles. 

Looking at the obstacles and the breakpoint set, a path moving to the right and then up towards the breakpoint (2.0, 1.72) seems plausible. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.0),    # Start within the start set
    (2.0, 0.0),    # Move right, staying below Obstacle 2
    (2.0, 1.72),   # Move up to Breakpoint Set 1
    (3.5, 2.5)    # Move diagonally to the goal set 
]
```

This path avoids both obstacles:

* **Obstacle 1:** The path stays completely to the right of Obstacle 1.
* **Obstacle 2:** The path initially moves right, staying below the lowest point of Obstacle 2, before moving upwards. 

This path also fulfills the other requirements:

* **Start and End:** The path begins within the start set and ends within the goal set.
* **Breakpoints:** The path passes through the breakpoint (2.0, 1.72) from Breakpoint Set 1.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 11:03:28 AM] The initial path goes directly towards the breakpoint (2.0, 0.0) but unfortunately collides with Obstacle 2. 

To circumvent this, we can leverage the provided breakpoint (2.0, 1.72) which lies within the 'channel' created by the obstacles. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.0, 0.87),    # Starting at the top vertex of the start set to move upwards
    (2.0, 1.72),    # Moving towards the valid breakpoint
    (3.0, 2.5),    # Approaching the goal set while staying clear of obstacles 
    (3.46, 2.87)     # Ending at a point within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(0.0, 0.87):**  We start at the top vertex of the start set. This starting point is chosen to allow for an upward movement which avoids an immediate collision with Obstacle 2.
2. **(2.0, 1.72):** We head directly to the provided valid breakpoint, staying within the clear space.
3. **(3.0, 2.5):**  This waypoint positions us closer to the goal set while carefully navigating the region between the obstacles. 
4. **(3.46, 2.87):** Finally, we arrive safely at a point inside the goal set.

This adjusted path successfully avoids all obstacles and fulfills the requirements of the task.
