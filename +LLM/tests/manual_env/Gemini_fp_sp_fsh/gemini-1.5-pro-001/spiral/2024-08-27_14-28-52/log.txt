# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.75, 0.75], [0.25, 0.75], [0.25, 0.25], [0.75, 0.25]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.0, 0.0], [-2.0, 0.0], [-2.0, -2.0], [15.0, -2.0]]

			Obstacle 4: [[14.0, 4.0], [4.0, 4.0], [4.0, 1.0], [14.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 5: [[14.0, 10.0], [5.0, 10.0], [5.0, 4.0], [14.0, 4.0]]
			Obstacle 6: [[14.0, 14.0], [4.0, 14.0], [4.0, 11.0], [14.0, 11.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.25, 0.5), (2.25, 14.5)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 02:28:58 PM] The path can utilize the open space available in the environment and can be planned as follows:
1. Starting within the start set, the path can move towards the breakpoint (2.25, 0.5).
2. From the breakpoint, the path can move upward, avoiding Obstacle 3, towards the goal set. 

Based on this strategy, a possible path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.75, 0.5),  # Start within the start set
    (2.25, 0.5),  # Pass through Breakpoint Set 1 
    (2.25, 3),    # Move upwards, maintaining a safe distance from Obstacle 3
    (4.5,  4.5)   # End within the goal set 
]
```

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Goal Position: End within the specified rectangular goal set.
Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 02:29:09 PM] The previous attempt failed because it tried to move up from a breakpoint while staying on the same x-coordinate, colliding with Obstacle 3.  I'll adjust the path to navigate around the obstacles and reach the goal.

1. **Valid Subpath:** The provided valid subpath ends at (2.25, 0.5).

2. **Navigating Obstacles:** We need to go around Obstacles 3 and 4 to reach the goal. Let's first navigate around Obstacle 3.

3. **Going Right:**  We can move rightwards, staying below Obstacle 3. A safe passage seems to be at a y-coordinate of 0.5.

4. **Reaching a Safe X-Coordinate:** Let's move rightwards to an x-coordinate of 4.5, staying at a y-coordinate of 0.5.

5. **Going Up:** Now, we can safely move upwards, avoiding Obstacle 4. We'll target a y-coordinate of 4.5 to enter the goal area.

6. **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, we can move leftwards to reach a point within the goal set.

Here's the updated path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.75, 0.5), # start at the valid subpath end
    (4.5, 0.5),  # move rightwards, staying below Obstacle 3
    (4.5, 4.5),  # move upwards, avoiding Obstacle 4
    (4.5, 4.5)   # move leftwards into the goal set
]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 02:29:17 PM] The current path attempts to move directly upwards from the valid subpath endpoint (4.5, 0.5) to (4.5, 4.5), leading to a collision with Obstacle 4. We need to find a way around this obstacle while also ensuring we pass through a breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1. 

Instead of moving upwards directly, we can first leverage the valid subpath and move rightwards towards the breakpoint (2.25, 0.5). From there, we can safely move upwards, avoiding Obstacle 3, and then navigate towards the goal. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.75, 0.5),   # Starting point within the start set.
    (2.25, 0.5),   # Move rightwards to the breakpoint (2.25, 0.5).
    (2.25, 14.5),  # Move upwards, passing through the breakpoint and avoiding Obstacle 3.
    (4.5, 14.5),  # Move rightwards, staying clear of Obstacle 6.
    (4.5, 4.5)   # Move downwards to the goal point within the goal set.
]
```

This path successfully navigates around Obstacle 4 by first moving to the breakpoint and then upwards, avoiding all obstacles and reaching the goal while passing through a breakpoint.

    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 02:29:26 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 3. The current path attempts to go from a breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1 directly up to the top of the environment, but Obstacle 3 blocks this path. 

Instead, the path can be adjusted to go around Obstacle 3. Since the goal is to the right of Obstacle 3, it's more efficient to go around the left side of the obstacle.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.75, 0.5),  # Start within the start set 
    (2.25, 0.5),  # Reach the first breakpoint
    (2.25, 0.75),  # Move up slightly to avoid the corner of Obstacle 3
    (0.5, 0.75),  # Move left to clear Obstacle 3
    (0.5, 14.5),  # Move upwards, staying clear of obstacles 
    (4.5, 14.5),  # Move right, staying above all obstacles
    (4.5, 4.5)   # Move down into the goal set
]
```

This path:

* Starts within the start set.
* Reaches a breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1.
* Avoids all obstacles by navigating around Obstacle 3.
* Ends within the goal set.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.

[08/27/2024 02:29:37 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid Obstacle 6. Since the valid subpath ends above Obstacle 6, we can try to navigate below it.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.75, 0.5),   # Start in the start set
    (2.25, 0.5),   # Reach breakpoint
    (2.25, 0.75),  # Move slightly up

    (0.5, 10.5),  # Move up, staying clear of Obstacle 3
    (4.5, 10.5),  # Move right, staying above Obstacle 5
    (4.5, 4.5)   # Reach the goal set 
]
```

This path carefully maneuvers through the obstacles:

1. It starts at the breakpoint and navigates to a point above Obstacle 5 and clear of Obstacle 3.
2. Then it moves directly right, staying clear of Obstacle 6.
3. Finally, it reaches the goal set.

2. **Navigating Around Obstacle 3:**  We need to route the path around Obstacle 3 to proceed towards the goal.

4. **Reaching the Goal:** From the breakpoint, we can move horizontally towards the goal set without encountering obstacles.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 02:29:56 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid Obstacle 3. Since we have a valid subpath that leads up to y=10.5, we can try to navigate around Obstacle 3.

1. **Valid Subpath Continuation**: Instead of going east at y=10.5, we can try going east at y=1. This allows us to clear Obstacle 3 from the south.
2. **Maneuvering Around Obstacles**:  We can then move north, aiming to pass east of Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 6.
3. **Reaching the Goal**: Finally, proceed towards the goal set.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.75, 0.5),   
    (2.25, 0.5),  
    (2.25, 0.75), 
    (0.5, 0.75),   
    (0.5, 10.5),  
    (0.5, 1.0),  # Move south to clear Obstacle 3
    (4.5, 1.0),  # Move east, staying below Obstacle 3
    (4.5, 14.5), # Move north, passing east of Obstacles 3 and 6

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

[08/27/2024 02:30:07 PM] The issue arises when the path tries to move from (0.5, 1.0) to (4.5, 1.0) as this line segment directly intersects with obstacles 3 and 4.  We can circumvent this problem by navigating around these obstacles.

Instead of going directly to (4.5, 1.0) from (0.5, 1.0), let's utilize the upper airspace and the second breakpoint (2.25, 14.5). Here's how we can adjust the path:

1. **Continue from the last valid waypoint (0.5, 1.0).**
2. **Move upwards to  (0.5, 14.5) to avoid obstacles 3 and 4.** 
3. **Move rightwards to the second breakpoint (2.25, 14.5).**
4. **Move downwards to (2.25, 4.5) to position ourselves for entry into the goal set.**
5. **Finally, move rightwards to (4.5, 4.5) within the goal set.**

Here's the corrected path:

```
new_path = [(0.75, 0.5), (2.25, 0.5), (2.25, 0.75), (0.5, 0.75), (0.5, 10.5), (0.5, 1.0), (0.5, 14.5), (2.25, 14.5), (2.25, 4.5), (4.5, 4.5)]

    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 02:30:22 PM] The problem lies in the segment connecting (4.5, 0.75) to (4.5, 4.5), which cuts through Obstacle 4. 

To circumvent this, let's reroute the path after the valid subpath. Since the goal lies to the top-right of Obstacle 4, we can:

1. **Continue upwards:** From (4.5, 0.75), move upwards to a y-coordinate greater than the top boundary of Obstacle 4 (y = 4).  
2. **Move right:** At this higher y-coordinate, move rightwards, clearing the rightmost x-coordinate of Obstacle 4 (x = 14).
3. **Reach the goal:** Finally, navigate downwards to any point within the goal set.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.75, 0.5),  
    (2.25, 0.5),  
    (2.25, 0.75), 
    (4.5, 0.75), 
    (4.5, 4.5),  # Move upwards to clear Obstacle 4
    (14.5, 4.5), # Move rightwards, clearing Obstacle 4
    (4.5, 4.5)   # Reach the goal set 
]

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

[08/27/2024 02:30:31 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 4. The current valid subpath takes us to the left side of Obstacle 4, but we can't simply go up because of Obstacles 3 and 6. 

Therefore, we need to navigate around these obstacles.  One approach is to go around Obstacle 3 from the left:

1. **Continue from the last valid point:** (4.5, 0.75)
2. **Move left, giving a wide berth to Obstacle 3:** (0.5, 0.75)
3. **Move upward, staying clear of Obstacle 3:** (0.5, 14.5)
4. **Move right, passing above Obstacles 3 and 6:** (14.5, 14.5)
5. **Move downward, passing Obstacle 5:** (14.5, 4.5)
6. **Move left to the goal:** (4.5, 4.5)

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [(0.75, 0.5), (2.25, 0.5), (2.25, 0.75), (4.5, 0.75), (0.5, 0.75), (0.5, 14.5), (14.5, 14.5), (14.5, 4.5), (4.5, 4.5)]

[08/27/2024 02:30:47 PM] The path goes wrong when it tries to connect back to the goal region from (14.5, 4.5). Instead, we can navigate around obstacle 5. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [(0.75, 0.5), (2.25, 0.5), (2.25, 0.75), (4.5, 0.75), (0.5, 0.75), (0.5, 14.5), (14.5, 14.5), (14.5, 4.5), (14.5, 3.5), (4.5, 3.5), (4.5, 4.5)]
```

Here's the breakdown of the changes:

1. **Continue from the valid subpath:** We keep the valid subpath until (14.5, 4.5).
2. **Navigate around obstacle 5:**
    - Move downwards from (14.5, 4.5) to (14.5, 3.5) to avoid crossing obstacle 5. 
3. **Connect to the goal:**
    -  Move leftwards from (14.5, 3.5) to (4.5, 3.5), safely bypassing obstacle 5.
    - Finally, move upwards to (4.5, 4.5) to reach the goal set.

This new path maintains obstacle avoidance and successfully connects the start and goal sets while passing through the required breakpoint.

    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 02:30:56 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 4. Since the longest valid subpath takes us close to the goal, we can try to adjust from there.

From the last valid point (14.5, 3.5), we can move downwards to (14.5, 0.5) to go below all obstacles. Then, we can move leftwards to (4.5, 0.5) to align with the goal set. Finally, we can move upwards to (4.5, 4.5) to reach the goal.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.75, 0.5), 
    (2.25, 0.5),
    (2.25, 0.75),

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 02:31:07 PM] The path goes wrong when it tries to connect back to the goal region from the right side. Instead, we should utilize the top route and connect down. I will also simplify the path since it backtracks unnecessarily.

```
new_path = [
    (0.75, 0.5),  # Start
    (2.25, 0.5),  # Breakpoint
    (2.25, 14.5), # Breakpoint 
    (4.5, 14.5),  # Move towards goal
    (4.5, 4.5)   # Reach goal
]
```

Here's the thought process:

1. **Start and Breakpoint:** We begin at (0.75, 0.5) within the start set and immediately head towards the first breakpoint at (2.25, 0.5).
2. **Second Breakpoint:** From there, we move vertically to the second breakpoint at (2.25, 14.5), staying clear of all obstacles.
3. **Approaching the Goal:**  We then proceed horizontally to (4.5, 14.5), positioning ourselves directly above the goal region.
4. **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, we move down safely to (4.5, 4.5) within the goal set.

This revised path efficiently navigates the obstacles while satisfying all requirements.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [

[08/27/2024 02:31:18 PM] The current path attempts to move downwards south of obstacle 1, but there is no path through from the first breakpoint to the goal without passing through obstacles. 

Instead, we should try going north of obstacles 3 and 6.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.75, 0.75], [0.25, 0.75], [0.25, 0.25], [0.75, 0.25]]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 02:31:24 PM] The current path collides with Obstacle 3 because it attempts to move directly upwards at the breakpoint. 

Instead of moving upwards, let's try going around Obstacle 3 to the right.  We can do this by leveraging the existing valid subpath and extending it. 

From (2.25, 0.5), we can move further right to a point past Obstacle 3, say (4.5, 0.5).  Then, we can safely move upwards to (4.5, 14.5), bypassing all obstacles. Finally, we can move left to reach the goal set at (5.0, 14.5).

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.75, 0.5), 
    (2.25, 0.5), 
    (4.5, 0.5),

Since we already used the breakpoint (2.25, 0.5) from Set 1, we need to find a way to reach the goal set while circumventing Obstacle 3.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.75, 0.5),   # Start point, same as before
    (2.25, 0.5),   # Breakpoint, same as before
    (2.25, -1.0),  # Move down, clear of Obstacle 3
    (4.5, -1.0),  # Move right, staying clear of Obstacle 3
    (4.5, 4.5)   # Move up into the goal set
]
```

1. **Move Down:** Instead of going up from (2.25, 0.5), we move down to (2.25, -1.0). This takes us below Obstacle 3.
2. **Move Right:** We then move right to (4.5, -1.0), staying below and clear of Obstacle 3.
3. **Move Up to Goal:** Finally, we move upwards from (4.5, -1.0) to (4.5, 4.5), reaching a point safely within the goal set.

This new path avoids all obstacles and meets the given criteria.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.75, 0.75], [0.25, 0.75], [0.25, 0.25], [0.75, 0.25]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.0, 0.0], [-2.0, 0.0], [-2.0, -2.0], [15.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.0, 15.0], [-2.0, 15.0], [-2.0, -0.0], [0.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[4.0, 14.0], [1.0, 14.0], [1.0, 1.0], [4.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 4: [[14.0, 4.0], [4.0, 4.0], [4.0, 1.0], [14.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 5: [[14.0, 10.0], [5.0, 10.0], [5.0, 4.0], [14.0, 4.0]]
			Obstacle 6: [[14.0, 14.0], [4.0, 14.0], [4.0, 11.0], [14.0, 11.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.25, 0.5), (2.25, 14.5)]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.75, 0.5), (2.25, 0.5), (2.25, -1.0), (4.5, -1.0), (4.5, 4.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 2 between points (2.25, 0.5) and (2.25, -1.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 1: [[15.0, 0.0], [-2.0, 0.0], [-2.0, -2.0], [15.0, -2.0]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.75, 0.5), (2.25, 0.5)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 02:31:48 PM] The current path tries to go downwards and pass below obstacle 1. However, this is not possible due to the extent of the obstacle. Instead, we should try going upwards and pass above all the obstacles to reach the goal. 

new_path = [
    (0.75, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (2.25, 0.5), # reach breakpoint
    (2.25, 14.5), # reach the second breakpoint
    (4.5, 14.5), # move right, maintaining a safe distance from obstacles
    (4.5, 4.5) # move down into the goal set

[08/27/2024 02:32:12 PM] The path needs to navigate around obstacle 3 to reach the goal. A viable option is to route the path above obstacle 3 and then towards the goal. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.75, 0.5),   # Starting point, same as before
    (2.25, 0.5),   # Maintain x-coordinate, moving outside of potential conflict with obstacle 3
    (2.25, 14.5),  # Go above obstacle 3 by aligning with breakpoint
    (4.5, 14.5),   # Move right, staying clear of obstacle 6
    (4.5, 4.5)    # Move down to the goal within the goal set
]
```

This path addresses the obstacle collision and maintains connection with the breakpoints.
