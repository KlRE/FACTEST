# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.75, 0.75], [0.25, 0.75], [0.25, 0.25], [0.75, 0.25]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.

		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 02:32:29 PM] The first segment of the proposed path crosses obstacle 3. Since the provided valid subpath only contains the start point, a new path needs to be generated. 

Let's analyze the environment to find a valid path:

1. **Start and Goal:**  We need to start within the start set (bottom left) and reach the goal set (top right). 
2. **Obstacles:** Obstacles 3 and 4 create a barrier on the right side of the start position, while obstacles 5 and 6 block the direct path above the goal.
3. **Breakpoints:** The only available breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1 is (2.25, 14.5). This point lies above obstacle 3, which makes it a good starting point to navigate around the obstacle cluster.

Considering these factors, the following path is proposed:

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    // Start within the start set
    (0.5, 14.5),   // Move upwards, avoiding obstacle 2
    (2.25, 14.5),  // Reach the breakpoint, passing above obstacle 3 
    (2.25, 5.5),   // Move downwards, staying clear of obstacles 3 and 4
    (4.5, 5.5),    // Move right, avoiding obstacles 5 and 6
    (4.5, 4.5)     // Reach the goal set 
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles and successfully connects the start and goal sets by leveraging the provided breakpoint.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 02:32:47 PM] The current path goes too far to the right, colliding with obstacles 4, 5, and 6. It would be easier to navigate around these obstacles from the left side.

Here's a revised path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start in the start set
    (0.5, 14.5),   # Move upwards, staying clear of obstacles
    (2.25, 14.5),  # Pass through the breakpoint
    (2.25, 8.0),   # Move downwards, staying left of the obstacles 
    (4.5, 8.0),    # Move rightwards, towards the goal
    (4.5, 4.5)     # Move downwards to end in the goal set
] 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Start:** Begin at (0.5, 0.5), inside the start set.
2. **Upwards:** Move straight up to (0.5, 14.5), staying clear of all obstacles.
3. **Breakpoint:**  Reach the breakpoint at (2.25, 14.5).
4. **Downwards:** Move downwards to (2.25, 8.0), staying left of obstacles 3, 4, 5, and 6.
5. **Rightwards:** Move right to (4.5, 8.0), preparing to enter the goal set.
6. **Goal:**  Move downwards to (4.5, 4.5), ending inside the goal set.

This revised path avoids all obstacles while satisfying the given constraints.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 02:32:54 PM] The issue arises when the path tries to go from (2.25, 14.5) to (2.25, 8.0), directly through Obstacle 3. 

We can bypass this by navigating around Obstacle 3. Since the goal is to the right and the path has already passed through a breakpoint, we can guide the path east, then south. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start
    (0.5, 14.5),  # Breakpoint
    (5.0, 14.5),   # Move East, clear of Obstacle 3 
    (5.0, 4.5)    # Move South, ending within the goal set
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles and meets the given requirements.

[08/27/2024 02:33:14 PM] The feedback correctly points out that the provided path intersects with obstacles 5 and 6. Also, it doesn't pass through any breakpoints in Breakpoint Set 1. 

Here's a possible path correction:

1. **Start:** We can keep the starting point (0.5, 0.5). 
2. **Reach Breakpoint:** To satisfy the breakpoint requirement, we need to direct the path towards the second breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1: (2.25, 14.5). A straight line to this point is clear of obstacles.
3. **Navigate Around Obstacles:**  From (2.25, 14.5), we need to navigate around obstacles 3 and 6 to reach the goal area.  We can do this by moving rightwards, staying clear of obstacle 6, until we are directly above the goal area.
4. **Reach Goal:** Finally, move straight down to a point within the goal set, for instance (5.0, 4.5).

Based on these adjustments, the proposed new path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   
    (2.25, 14.5),

### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 02:33:23 PM] The initial path segment crosses obstacle 3. To avoid this, we can try routing the path around the left side of obstacle 3. 

Let's try this new path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 1.5),    # Move upwards to clear the top left corner of obstacle 2
    (0.5, 14.5),   # Continue upwards to a point vertically aligned with the breakpoint
    (2.25, 14.5),  # Move rightwards to the breakpoint 
    (6.0, 14.5),  # Move rightwards, staying clear of obstacles 3 and 6
    (5.0, 4.5)   # Move diagonally into the goal set
]
```

This path aims to:

1. **Navigate around obstacle 3:** By initially moving upwards, the path avoids the intersection with obstacle 3.
2. **Utilize the breakpoint:** It incorporates the breakpoint (2.25, 14.5) to fulfill that requirement.
3. **Maintain a safe distance from obstacles:**  The path segments are designed to keep a clear distance from all obstacles. 
4. **Reach the goal:**  The path terminates within the defined goal set.

[08/27/2024 02:33:32 PM] The current path fails because it tries to move directly from a point above obstacles 5 and 6 to the goal, resulting in a collision. 

We can adjust the path by going around these obstacles. Since the valid subpath ends above the obstacles, we can guide it around obstacle 6 first, and then obstacle 5.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    
    (0.5, 1.5),    
    (0.5, 14.5),   
    (2.25, 14.5),

    (15.0, 5.0),  # Move downwards to a position that clears obstacle 5
    (5.0, 4.5)   # Finally, move to the goal
]
```

This path avoids obstacles by taking a detour above and to the right of obstacles 6 and 5 before approaching the goal.

[08/27/2024 02:33:41 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 5. Looking at the provided map, we can navigate below Obstacle 5 to reach the goal.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (0.5, 1.5), 
    (0.5, 14.5), 
    (2.25, 14.5), 
    (6.0, 14.5), 
    (6.0, 15.5), 
    (15.0, 15.5), 
    (15.0, 3.5),  # Move down below Obstacle 5
    (5.0, 3.5),  # Move left towards the goal
    (5.0, 4.5)   # Arrive at the goal 
]
```

Here's the thought process:

1. **Utilize the valid subpath:**  The initial part of the path successfully navigates to a point above all obstacles. 
2. **Identify the problem:** The collision occurs when attempting to move directly from above Obstacle 5 to the goal.
3. **Find an alternative route:** Instead of moving directly, we can move further down below Obstacle 5 before approaching the goal from the right. 
4. **Adjust waypoints:** Add waypoints to guide the path downwards, then left towards the goal set.

This adjusted path maintains the valid segments of the original path while avoiding Obstacle 5.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[08/27/2024 02:33:54 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 4. Since the valid subpath ends above the obstacle, we can try going around it.

Let's add a waypoint to the right of Obstacle 4 and above Obstacle 5, then continue towards the goal set:

## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.

[08/27/2024 02:34:04 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 5. One option is to go around this obstacle.

From the last valid point (15.0, 8.5), we can move downwards to (15.0, 2.5) to go below Obstacle 5. Then, we can move left to (4.5, 2.5), which avoids all obstacles and allows us to move upwards to (4.5, 4.5) to reach the goal area.

[08/27/2024 02:34:11 PM] The current path goes too far south after navigating around Obstacle 6.  We can adjust the path to move directly westward above obstacles 4 and 5 after clearing obstacle 6. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 1.5), (0.5, 14.5), (2.25, 14.5), (6.0, 14.5), (6.0, 15.5), (15.0, 15.5), (15.0, 8.5), (15.0, 6.5), (4.5, 6.5), (4.5, 4.5)]
```

Here's a breakdown of the changes:

*   We keep the initial path segments to navigate to point `(15.0, 8.5)` above obstacle 6.
*   Instead of moving south to `(15.0, 2.5)`, we adjust the path to move westward to `(15.0, 6.5)` staying above obstacles 5 and 4. 
*   Finally, we can move directly south to  `(4.5, 6.5)` and then to `(4.5, 4.5)` to reach the goal set.

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 1.5), (0.5, 14.5), (2.25, 14.5), (6.0, 14.5), (6.0, 15.5), (15.0, 15.5), (15.0, 8.5), (15.0, 6.5)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 02:34:27 PM] The issue lies in the segment connecting (15.0, 6.5) to (4.5, 6.5), as it cuts through Obstacle 5. To circumvent this, we can reroute the path by leveraging the upper boundary of Obstacle 5.

Instead of directly moving towards the goal from (15.0, 6.5), we can follow these steps:

1. **Move upwards:**  From (15.0, 6.5), move upwards to (15.0, 10.5), staying clear above Obstacle 5.
2. **Move leftwards:** Traverse horizontally from (15.0, 10.5) to (4.5, 10.5), remaining above Obstacle 5.
3. **Move downwards:** Finally, descend from (4.5, 10.5) to (4.5, 4.5), reaching the goal set.

This strategy provides a clear path by navigating around the problematic Obstacle 5.


Here is the modified path:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 1.5), (0.5, 14.5), (2.25, 14.5), (6.0, 14.5), (6.0, 15.5), (15.0, 15.5), (15.0, 8.5), (15.0, 6.5), (15.0, 10.5), (4.5, 10.5), (4.5, 4.5)]
```
