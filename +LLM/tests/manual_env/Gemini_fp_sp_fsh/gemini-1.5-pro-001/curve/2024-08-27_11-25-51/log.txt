# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[6.0, 7.0], [5.0, 7.0], [5.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[-2.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0], [-2.0, -1.0], [0.0, -1.0]]

			Obstacle 4: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -1.0], [4.0, -1.0]]
			Obstacle 5: [[6.0, 3.0], [4.0, 3.0], [4.0, 1.0], [6.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 6: [[-2.0, 10.0], [-4.0, 10.0], [-4.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 8.0]]
			Obstacle 7: [[0.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 6.0], [0.0, 6.0]]
			Obstacle 8: [[-1.0, 0.0], [1.0, -2.0], [3.0, 0.0], [1.0, 2.0]]
			Obstacle 9: [[4.0, 8.0], [2.0, 8.0], [2.0, 6.0], [4.0, 6.0]]
			Obstacle 10: [[6.0, 10.0], [4.0, 10.0], [4.0, 8.0], [6.0, 8.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(0.5, -2.75), (0.5, 3.0), (0.5, 8.75)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 11:26:07 AM] The path can be planned by initially moving towards the first breakpoint, maneuvering around the obstacles strategically, and finally reaching the goal set. Here's a possible path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  # Start within the start set
    (-3.5, 4.0),  # Move down, staying clear of Obstacle 6 and 7
    (0.5, 3.0),   # Pass through Breakpoint Set 1 
    (2.0, 3.0),   # Move right, staying clear of Obstacle 3
    (4.0, 7.0)    # Move up to the center of the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(-3.5, 6.5):** Starts within the start set.
2. **(-3.5, 4.0):** Moves directly downwards, maintaining a safe distance from Obstacles 6 and 7. 
3. **(0.5, 3.0):**  Navigates to the breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1, successfully clearing Obstacle 3.
4. **(2.0, 3.0):** Moves rightwards, staying clear of Obstacle 3.
5. **(4.0, 7.0):**  Moves directly upwards to reach the goal set, avoiding Obstacle 9. 

This path ensures no intersections with obstacles and fulfills all the given requirements.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Goal Position: End within the specified rectangular goal set.
Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

]

[08/27/2024 11:26:14 AM] The previous path failed because it intersected with obstacle 9. To avoid this, we can adjust the path to go above obstacle 9. 

Starting from the last valid waypoint (2.0, 3.0), we can move upwards to (2.0, 9.0) to clear the obstacle 9. From there, we can move right to reach the goal set at (5.5, 9.0) and then downwards to (5.5, 6.5) to end within the goal set. This avoids all obstacles and satisfies the requirements.

Here is the updated path:

```
new_path = [

[08/27/2024 11:26:31 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid obstacles 3 and 9. Since we already passed through a breakpoint, we can focus on navigating around the obstacles to reach the goal set. 

1. **Analyzing the valid subpath:** The valid subpath ends at (2.0, 3.0) due to the intersection with obstacles 3 and 9.  We need to find a way to navigate around these obstacles to proceed towards the goal. 

2. **Identifying a new route:** Observing the layout of obstacles, we can plot a path that moves upwards from the last valid waypoint, goes around obstacle 3, then moves right towards the goal set.

3. **Constructing the new path:**
    * From (2.0, 3.0), move upwards to (2.0, 9.0) to go above obstacles 3 and 9. 
    * Then, proceed right to (5.5, 9.0) to align with the goal set.
    * Finally, move down to (5.5, 6.5) to end within the goal set.

    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 11:26:46 AM] The issue is with the segment connecting (2.0, 3.0) to (2.0, 9.0), which attempts to cross both Obstacles 3 and 9. 

Instead of going straight up, let's try going around Obstacle 3 on the right side. We can then continue towards the goal set.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5), 
    (-3.5, 4.0), 
    (0.5, 3.0),
    (2.0, 3.0), 
    (3.5, 4.0),  # Go around Obstacle 3
    (3.5, 8.0),  # Move up clearing Obstacle 9
    (5.5, 8.0), # Move towards the goal set
    (5.5, 6.5)   # End within the goal set
]
```

This path avoids crossing any obstacles:

* It maintains a safe distance from Obstacle 3 by going around it to the right.
* It clears Obstacle 9 by moving upward before continuing towards the goal.
* The remaining segments stay within free space.

[08/27/2024 11:27:03 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 9. Analyzing the environment, we can see that we can route the path below Obstacle 9. 

Instead of going directly from (3.5, 4.0) to (3.5, 8.0), we can add waypoints to go around Obstacle 9:

1. **From the last valid waypoint (3.5, 4.0), move right to (4.5, 4.0) to avoid Obstacle 9.**
2. **Move up to (4.5, 5.5) to stay clear of Obstacle 9.** 
3. **Continue moving right to (5.5, 5.5) to line up with the goal set.**
4. **Finally, move up to (5.5, 6.5) and reach the goal set.**

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [(-3.5, 6.5), (-3.5, 4.0), (0.5, 3.0), (2.0, 3.0), (3.5, 4.0), (4.5, 4.0), (4.5, 5.5), (5.5, 5.5), (5.5, 6.5)]
