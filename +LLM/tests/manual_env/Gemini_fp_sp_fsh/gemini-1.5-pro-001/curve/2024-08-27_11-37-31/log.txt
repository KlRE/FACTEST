# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[6.0, 7.0], [5.0, 7.0], [5.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[-2.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0]]

			Obstacle 5: [[6.0, 3.0], [4.0, 3.0], [4.0, 1.0], [6.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 6: [[-2.0, 10.0], [-4.0, 10.0], [-4.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 8.0]]

			Obstacle 8: [[-1.0, 0.0], [1.0, -2.0], [3.0, 0.0], [1.0, 2.0]]
			Obstacle 9: [[4.0, 8.0], [2.0, 8.0], [2.0, 6.0], [4.0, 6.0]]
			Obstacle 10: [[6.0, 10.0], [4.0, 10.0], [4.0, 8.0], [6.0, 8.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(0.5, -2.75), (0.5, 3.0), (0.5, 8.75)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 11:37:48 AM] Here's a possible path considering the provided data:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),    # Start within the start set
    (-3.5, 8.75),   # Move upwards, passing Breakpoint Set 1
    (0.5,  8.75),   # Move rightwards
    (0.5,  3.0),    # Move downwards, passing Breakpoint Set 1 again
    (0.5,  -2.75),  # Continue downwards, passing Breakpoint Set 1 a third time
    (6.5,  -2.75),  # Move rightwards, staying clear of obstacles
    (6.5,  6.5)     # Move upwards, ending within the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Starting Point:**  (-3.5, 6.5) lies within the start quadrilateral.
2. **Up and Around:** The path first moves upwards to bypass obstacles 6 and 7, reaching (0.5, 8.75). 
3. **Downward Trajectory:** It then descends, passing through breakpoint (0.5, 3.0) to navigate between obstacle clusters.
4. **Clearance and Goal:** Reaching (0.5, -2.75), the path stays clear of obstacles 2, 4, 5, and 8 before moving right towards the goal set. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Visual Verification:** It's crucial to visually plot the provided coordinates and the suggested path to ensure it avoids intersecting any obstacles. 
* **Safety Margin:**  The path maintains a safe distance from obstacles, avoiding mere contact with their boundaries. 
* **Breakpoint Utilization:** The path strategically utilizes the breakpoints to navigate through the environment effectively.

[08/27/2024 11:38:07 AM] The initial path goes straight up and intersects with Obstacle 6. To avoid this, we need to navigate around this obstacle. Additionally, the path needs to pass through a breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1 and eventually reach the goal set. 

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Starting Point:** We can use the initial starting point of (-3.5, 6.5).
2. **Navigating to Breakpoint:** The breakpoint (0.5, 8.75) is directly above our starting point and clear of obstacles. We can move straight up to this point: (-3.5, 6.5) -> (-3.5, 8.75).
3. **Moving Towards Goal:** From the breakpoint, we can move directly right, staying clear of Obstacle 7: (-3.5, 8.75) -> (0.5, 8.75). 
4. **Maneuvering Around Obstacle 9:** We need to navigate around Obstacle 9.  We can move down to (0.5, 6.5), clear of the obstacle: (0.5, 8.75) -> (0.5, 6.5).
5. **Reaching the Goal Set:** From here, we can move directly right, avoiding all obstacles, and end within the goal set: (0.5, 6.5) -> (5.5, 6.5). 

Therefore, the updated path is:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5), 
    (-3.5, 8.75), 
    (0.5, 8.75),

[08/27/2024 11:38:24 AM] The first segment of the provided path intersects with Obstacle 6. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around the obstacle. Since the breakpoint (0.5, 8.75) is already part of the path and seems helpful, we can aim to reach this breakpoint while avoiding obstacles. 

From the starting point (-3.5, 6.5), we can move horizontally to the right until we are clear of Obstacle 6. Then, we can move upwards to reach the breakpoint.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  # Start point
    (-1.5, 6.5),  # Move right to clear Obstacle 6
    (0.5, 6.5), # Continue moving right 
    (0.5, 8.75),  # Move upwards to the breakpoint
    (0.5, 6.5), # Move down to avoid obstacle 7
    (5.5, 6.5)   # Move right to the goal set
]
```

This path avoids obstacles, passes through the breakpoint, and reaches the goal set.

    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 11:38:31 AM] The initial path went through obstacle 7. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around obstacles 6 and 7. The breakpoint (0.5, 8.75) can be utilized for this purpose. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  # Starting point
    (-3.5, 8.0),  # Move upwards to avoid obstacle 7
    (0.5, 8.75),  # Use the breakpoint to navigate between obstacles 6 and 7
    (5.5, 8.0),  # Move towards the goal set
    (5.5, 6.5)   # Reach the goal set
]
```

This path avoids obstacles by moving upwards first, then utilizing the breakpoint to navigate around obstacles 6 and 7, and finally moving downwards to reach the goal set.

[08/27/2024 11:38:38 AM] The initial path attempts to move directly upwards from the start set, but obstacle 6 blocks the way. Instead, we can try utilizing the breakpoint (0.5, 8.75)  to navigate around the obstacles. 

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Start:** Begin at the edge of the start set, slightly offset from the corner to avoid potential line-of-sight issues with obstacle 6. A good starting point could be (-3.5, 6.5).
2. **Navigate Right:** Move rightwards, aiming to go above obstacles 7 and 3.  We can pass through the breakpoint (0.5, 8.75) to ensure we clear these obstacles.
3. **Approach Goal:** From the breakpoint, move rightwards, staying above obstacle 9 to avoid a collision. 
4. **Reach Goal:** Finally, descend into the goal set.  A suitable endpoint could be (5.5, 6.5).

Therefore, a revised path might look like this:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  
    (0.5, 8.75),  
    (5.5, 8.0),

[08/27/2024 11:38:46 AM] The current path fails because it directly crosses Obstacle 7. To circumvent this, we should utilize the breakpoint at (0.5, 3.0). This breakpoint is in a strategically advantageous position, allowing for a clear path around the lower obstacles. From the start, we can navigate to this breakpoint, then proceed to the right, utilizing a path above Obstacle 8 and below Obstacle 3. Finally, we can move upwards to reach the goal set.

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 3.0),   # Navigate to the breakpoint, avoiding Obstacle 7

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set

[08/27/2024 11:38:57 AM] The path needs to navigate around Obstacle 5 to reach the goal. One option is to go above it.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),   # Start in the start set
    (0.5, 3.0),    # Pass through the breakpoint 
    (0.5, 4.5),   # Move upward, clearing Obstacle 5
    (5.5, 4.5),    # Move right towards the goal set
    (5.5, 6.5)     # Move up into the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(-3.5, 6.5):** Starts within the start set.
2. **(0.5, 3.0):**  Passes through the required breakpoint.
3. **(0.5, 4.5):**  Moves upward to avoid Obstacle 5, ensuring a safe distance.
4. **(5.5, 4.5):** Moves right, staying clear of Obstacle 5 and heading towards the goal set.
5. **(5.5, 6.5):** Moves up into a clear area within the goal set. 

This path avoids all obstacles while fulfilling the given requirements.

## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.

[08/27/2024 11:39:09 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 3. To do this, we can route the path around the left side of the obstacle.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),   # Start point (unchanged)
    (0.5, 3.0),    # Breakpoint (unchanged)
    (-1.5, 3.0),   # Move left, keeping clear of Obstacle 3
    (-1.5, 4.5),   # Move upwards, clearing the top of Obstacle 3
    (0.5, 4.5),    # Move right, rejoining the original path
    (5.5, 4.5),    # Continue to the goal area 
    (5.5, 6.5)     # End point (unchanged)
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Start and Breakpoint:** The start point and the first breakpoint remain the same.
2. **Moving Left:** From the breakpoint, instead of going directly upwards, we first move left to `(-1.5, 3.0)`. This takes us clear of the rightmost vertex of Obstacle 3. 
3. **Moving Upwards:** From there, we move upwards to `(-1.5, 4.5)`, safely passing the top edge of Obstacle 3.
4. **Rejoining and Continuing:**  We then move right to `(0.5, 4.5)`, rejoining the originally intended path. The rest of the path to the goal remains valid. 

This adjusted path avoids all obstacles and successfully reaches the goal area.

[08/27/2024 11:39:19 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 3. Instead of going directly to (-1.5, 4.5), we can route the path above Obstacle 3 by leveraging the breakpoint (0.5, 8.75).

Here's a possible adjusted path:

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

[08/27/2024 11:39:27 AM] The path got stuck at the breakpoint (0.5, 3.0), as going upwards to the next breakpoint (0.5, 8.75) leads through Obstacle 3. The path needs to navigate around this obstacle. 

One solution is to move rightwards from (0.5, 3.0), go around Obstacle 3 and then move upwards. After passing Obstacle 3, the path can proceed to the goal set.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  # Start point
    (0.5, 3.0),   # Breakpoint 1
    (3.5, 3.0),   # Move right, keeping clear of Obstacle 3

## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.

[08/27/2024 11:39:41 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid Obstacle 9. Since the path is valid until (3.5, 3.0), we can continue from there. Instead of going up directly to (3.5, 9.0), we can navigate around Obstacle 9.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  # Start point
    (0.5, 3.0),   # Breakpoint
    (3.5, 3.0),   # Last valid point
    (3.5, 5.5),   # Move up, staying below Obstacle 9
    (4.5, 5.5),   # Move right, clearing Obstacle 9

    (5.5, 9.0),   # Move right towards the goal set

]

[08/27/2024 11:39:52 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 10.  I will reroute the path by going around Obstacle 10 to the right. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```python
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  # Start in the start set
    (0.5, 3.0),   # Pass through the breakpoint
    (3.5, 3.0),   # Continue towards the goal
    (3.5, 5.5),   # Move upwards to avoid Obstacle 5 
    (4.5, 5.5),   # Continue towards the goal
    (4.5, 10.5),  # Move upwards, clearing Obstacle 10
    (5.5, 10.5),  # Move right, towards the goal
    (5.5, 6.5)    # Move down into the goal set
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Going Around Obstacle 10:** Instead of moving directly upwards from `(4.5, 5.5)`, the path now goes up to  `(4.5, 10.5)` This takes the path above Obstacle 10.
2. **Approaching the Goal:** From `(4.5, 10.5)`, the path moves right to `(5.5, 10.5)`, and then finally downwards to `(5.5, 6.5)` to end within the goal set.

This adjusted path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles while successfully navigating from the start to the goal set.

    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 11:40:00 AM] The path goes up to avoid the lower obstacles, successfully navigates to the breakpoint (0.5, 3.0) and goes around obstacle 3. However,  it collides with obstacle 10 on its way to the goal. 

To fix this, we can adjust the path to go around the left side of obstacle 10 instead of trying to pass on the right. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),   # Start
    (0.5, 3.0),    # Breakpoint 
    (3.5, 3.0),    
    (3.5, 5.5),    
    (2.5, 5.5),    # Divert left to avoid obstacle 10 
    (2.5, 10.5),   # Go up north of obstacle 10
    (5.5, 10.5),   
    (5.5, 6.5)    # Goal
]
```

This path maintains a safe distance from all obstacles while reaching the goal.

[08/27/2024 11:40:09 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 3. I will reroute the path by going above Obstacle 3. 

The valid subpath takes us to (3.5, 5.5), which is just below Obstacle 3. From there, we can make the following adjustments:

1. **Go Up:** Continue moving upwards from (3.5, 5.5) to (3.5, 8.5) to clear the top of Obstacle 3.
2. **Go Right:**  Move right towards the goal set from (3.5, 8.5) to (5.5, 8.5).
3. **Go Down:** Finally, move down to enter the goal set from (5.5, 8.5) to (5.5, 6.5).

    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(0.5, -2.75), (0.5, 3.0), (0.5, 8.75)]

## Your generated path:

    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 11:40:29 AM] The current path collides with Obstacle 3 while attempting to move upwards. 

To circumvent this, we can leverage the breakpoint at (0.5, 8.75). From the valid subpath's endpoint (0.5, 3.0), we can move upwards to this breakpoint. Subsequently, we can navigate to the goal set while avoiding Obstacle 9.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  # Start point
    (0.5, 3.0),   # Breakpoint 1
    (0.5, 8.75),  # Breakpoint 2 - move upwards to avoid Obstacle 3
    (5.5, 8.75),  # Move right, staying clear of Obstacle 9
    (5.5, 6.5)   # End point within the goal set

[08/27/2024 11:40:44 AM] The path needs to navigate around Obstacle 3 to reach the goal. Let's try going around it to the right.  

We can keep the first two waypoints of the original path. From there, a new waypoint to the right of Obstacle 3 can be added.  This new waypoint needs a y-coordinate greater than the highest point of Obstacle 3 to avoid a collision.  The x-coordinate should allow a straight line to the goal without intersecting any obstacles. 

Finally, connect this new waypoint to the goal set.

[08/27/2024 11:41:00 AM] The previous path ran into trouble by hitting obstacles on its way to the goal. Let's adjust the strategy:

1. **Valid Subpath:** The segment from  (-3.5, 6.5) to (0.5, 3.0) is valid. We'll keep that.

2. **Navigating Obstacles:** Obstacles 3 and 9 create a kind of funnel. To get past them, we need to aim for a point above Obstacle 9.

3. **New Waypoints:**
   - From (0.5, 3.0), we'll navigate around Obstacle 3 by first going slightly to the left to (0.0, 3.0), then upwards to (0.0, 9.0) to clear Obstacle 9. 
   - From there, we can move right towards the goal, passing above Obstacle 9 with (3.5, 9.0).

4. **Reaching the Goal:** The final segment can proceed as before, to (5.5, 6.5) inside the goal set.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5), 
    (0.5, 3.0),

Here's the new path: 

```

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.

[08/27/2024 11:41:37 AM] The initial path was blocked by obstacles 3 and 7. To avoid these obstacles, we need to adjust the path to move below obstacle 7 and above obstacle 3. 

Looking at the breakpoints, the breakpoint (0.5, 3.0) seems promising. We can route the path through this breakpoint to navigate between the obstacles. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 6.5),  # Move right, staying above obstacle 7
    (0.5, 3.0),  # Move down, passing through the breakpoint and between obstacles 7 and 3
    (3.5, 3.0),  # Move right, staying below obstacle 3 
    (5.5, 6.5)   # Move up and right to end within the goal set 
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles while meeting the requirements of starting and ending in the correct sets and passing through a breakpoint.
