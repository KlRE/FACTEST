# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[6.0, 7.0], [5.0, 7.0], [5.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[-2.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0]]

			Obstacle 10: [[6.0, 10.0], [4.0, 10.0], [4.0, 8.0], [6.0, 8.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(0.5, -2.75), (0.5, 3.0), (0.5, 8.75)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.

    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 11:08:14 AM] It is difficult to provide a path without visualization or using an algorithm to check for collisions. However, here is a general idea of how a path could be created with a human-understandable explanation, keeping in mind the provided constraints:

**General Path Idea:**

1. **Start:** Begin at the top left corner of the start set  (-3.0, 7.0).
2. **Navigate Downwards:**  Move downwards, staying to the left of Obstacle 6 and Obstacle 7. 
3. **Breakpoint:** Pass through the breakpoint (0.5, 3.0) navigating between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3.
4. **Navigate Rightwards:** Move towards the goal, staying below Obstacle 3 and above Obstacle 9.
5. **Reach Goal:**  Finally, enter the goal set and end at the top right corner (6.0, 7.0). 

**Explanation:**

* This path takes advantage of the larger gaps between obstacles.
* Moving downwards first creates space to maneuver around the obstacles clustered in the center.
* Passing through the breakpoint (0.5, 3.0) early on helps in simplifying the path. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Precision Needed:** The success of this path depends on selecting precise waypoints to ensure a safe distance from all obstacles.  
* **Visualization Highly Recommended:**  This type of problem is best solved with a visual representation of the sets and obstacles to accurately plan the waypoint placements.

**Without an algorithm or visualization tool, it's impossible to guarantee that the described path or any specific set of waypoints would be collision-free.**

		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

]

[08/27/2024 11:08:43 AM] The initial segment of the provided path directly intersects with Obstacles 3 and 7. To circumvent this, the path needs to navigate below Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 7. 

One viable approach involves leveraging the provided breakpoint (0.5, 3.0) from Breakpoint Set 1. This breakpoint lies below Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 7. 

From the starting point, the path can move downwards, aiming to pass through this breakpoint. After clearing these obstacles, the path can proceed towards the goal set. Additionally, carefully maneuvering around Obstacle 2 might be necessary.

Here’s a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),  # Start within the start set
    (-3.5, 4.0),  # Move downwards, staying clear of Obstacle 7
    (0.5, 3.0),   # Pass through the breakpoint, avoiding Obstacles 3 and 7
    (0.5, 1.0),  # Continue downwards
    (2.0, 0.0),  # Move towards the right
    (4.0, 1.0),  # Continue right
    (5.5, 3.0),  # Move upwards towards the goal set
    (5.5, 6.5)   # Reach the goal set

[08/27/2024 11:08:51 AM] The path needs to navigate around obstacle 8 to reach the goal. There are a few options: going above or below it. 

Let's try going below. This allows us to keep the breakpoint (0.5, 3.0) and potentially use the breakpoint (0.5, -2.75) from Set 1. 

From (0.5, 3.0), we need to go down while avoiding obstacle 8. A waypoint at (0.5, -3.0) seems suitable. Then, we can move right towards the goal, bypassing obstacle 4 with a waypoint like (4.0, -3.0). Finally, we can move up to reach the goal set at (5.5, 6.5).

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[6.0, 7.0], [5.0, 7.0], [5.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[-2.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0]]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

[08/27/2024 11:09:10 AM] The path gets stuck after the breakpoint (0.5, 3.0) as it tries to go down. 
To fix this, we need to navigate around obstacle 8. 

Here's a possible approach:

1.  **From the breakpoint:** Continue to a point slightly to the right of obstacle 8, for example (1.5, 3.0) 
2. **Navigate below:** Move downwards to a point below obstacle 8 and obstacle 4, like (1.5,-3.0).
3. **Approach the goal:** Move right, avoiding obstacle 4, towards the goal set. A possible waypoint could be (5.5,-3.0).
4. **Reach the goal:**  Finally, move upwards to reach the goal set at (5.5, 6.5).

**New path:**

```
new_path = [(-3.5, 6.5), (-3.5, 4.0), (0.5, 3.0), (1.5, 3.0), (1.5, -3.0), (5.5, -3.0), (5.5, 6.5)]

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[6.0, 7.0], [5.0, 7.0], [5.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[-2.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0], [-2.0, -1.0], [0.0, -1.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(0.5, -2.75), (0.5, 3.0), (0.5, 8.75)]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(-3.5, 6.5), (-3.5, 4.0), (0.5, 3.0), (1.5, 3.0), (2.5, 1.0), (2.5, -3.0), (5.5, -3.0), (5.5, 6.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 4 between points (1.5, 3.0) and (2.5, 1.0) intersects with obstacle(s):

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(-3.5, 6.5), (-3.5, 4.0), (0.5, 3.0), (1.5, 3.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 11:09:43 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 4. We can achieve this by routing the path below Obstacle 4. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),    # Start in the start set
    (-3.5, 4.0),    # Move down, staying clear of Obstacle 1
    (0.5, 3.0),     # Pass through the breakpoint
    (1.5, 3.0),     # Continue moving right
    (1.5, -2.0),    # Move down, going around Obstacle 4 
    (2.5, -2.0),    # Move right, staying clear of Obstacle 4 
    (5.5, -2.0),    # Continue right towards the goal
    (5.5, 6.5)     # Move up to the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **From (1.5, 3.0) to (1.5, -2.0):**  Instead of moving directly towards Obstacle 4, the path takes a detour downwards.
2. **From (1.5, -2.0) to (2.5, -2.0):** This segment moves the path clear of the right edge of Obstacle 4. 
3. **From (2.5, -2.0) to (5.5, -2.0):** This segment continues rightward, ensuring a safe distance from Obstacle 4 and other obstacles.
4. **From (5.5, -2.0) to (5.5, 6.5):** Finally, the path moves upwards to reach the goal set.

This adjusted path avoids all obstacles while successfully passing through the required breakpoint and reaching the goal set.

[08/27/2024 11:10:02 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 8. One option is to route the path around the left side of Obstacle 8.

1. **New Waypoints:** Added waypoints (-0.5, 1.0) and (1.0, 0.0) to steer the path around the left of Obstacle 8. 
2. **Maintaining Valid Subpath:** The new path continues from the last valid point (0.5, 3.0) of the previous path.
3. **Obstacle Avoidance:** The adjusted path maintains a safe distance from Obstacle 8, avoiding any intersection.
4. **Goal Endpoint:** The path still successfully reaches the goal set.

2. **Passes through** the breakpoint (0.5, 3.0).
3. **Avoids Obstacle 2** by going south through breakpoint (0.5, -2.75) and moving below it.
4. **Avoids Obstacles 4 and 5** by maintaining a safe distance while moving towards the goal.
5. **Ends** within the goal set at (5.5, 6.5).

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[6.0, 7.0], [5.0, 7.0], [5.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[-2.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0]]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 3 between points (0.5, 3.0) and (0.5, -2.75) intersects with obstacle(s):

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(-3.5, 6.5), (-3.5, 4.0), (0.5, 3.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 11:10:24 AM] The path goes through obstacle 8 because it cuts through the middle. To avoid this, the path needs to go around obstacle 8. 

One way to go around it is to go "below" it. To achieve this, I will add two waypoints.

    (-3.5, 4.0),   # Continue from the last valid waypoint
    (0.5, 3.0),    # Use the valid breakpoint

    (1.5, 8.75),   # Move upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 3

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[6.0, 7.0], [5.0, 7.0], [5.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[-2.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0]]

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 11:11:02 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 3. Since we have a valid path up to (1.5, 3.0), let's try to continue from there. 

The breakpoint (0.5, 8.75) is not feasible as it leads us to a dead-end within Obstacle 3. We need to find a way around Obstacle 3 to reach the goal. 

One option is to navigate below Obstacle 3:

1. **From the last valid point (1.5, 3.0):** Move slightly to the right to (2.0, 3.0). This keeps us clear of Obstacle 3.
2. **Move down and right:** Aim for a point below Obstacle 3, like (3.0, 1.0).
3. **Proceed rightward:** Continue to a point that allows a clear path upwards, such as (4.0, 1.0).
4. **Move upwards:**  Go to (4.0, 6.5) to align with the goal set.
5. **Reach the goal:** Finally, move left to (5.5, 6.5) inside the goal set.

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [(-3.5, 6.5), (-3.5, 4.0), (0.5, 3.0), (1.5, 3.0), (2.0, 3.0), (3.0, 1.0), (4.0, 1.0), (4.0, 6.5), (5.5, 6.5)]

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5), 
    (-3.5, 4.0), 
    (0.5, 3.0), 
    (1.5, 3.0),

    (4.0, 4.0), # continue right
    (4.0, 6.5), 
    (5.5, 6.5)

```

This new path maintains a safe distance from Obstacle 4 by first moving upwards and then proceeding rightwards. The rest of the path remains unchanged as it successfully navigates to the goal set without intersecting any other obstacles.

[08/27/2024 11:11:25 AM] The feedback indicates that the path intersects with Obstacle 9. To rectify this, we need to adjust the path to navigate around this obstacle. 

Instead of going directly from (4.0, 4.0) to (4.0, 6.5), we can guide the path around Obstacle 9. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5), 
    (-3.5, 4.0), 
    (0.5, 3.0), 
    (1.5, 3.0), 
    (2.0, 3.0), 
    (2.0, 4.0), 
    (3.0, 4.0), 
    (4.0, 4.0),  
    (4.0, 5.0),  # Move up to y=5.0 to go around Obstacle 9
    (5.0, 5.0),  # Move right to x=5.0
    (5.5, 6.5)   # Continue to the goal
]
```

This revised path maintains a safe distance from Obstacle 9 while still adhering to the other path requirements.
