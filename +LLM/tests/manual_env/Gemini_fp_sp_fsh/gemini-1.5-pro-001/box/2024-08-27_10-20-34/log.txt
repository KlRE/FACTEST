# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 0.56), (5.12, 9.44)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 10:20:48 AM] The provided environment has a large open space between the start and goal sets, with the single obstacle positioned to the right and slightly overlapping with the goal set vertically. Therefore, a relatively simple path can be drawn:

1. **Start:** Begin within the start set at point (1.75, 1.75).
2. **Navigate Upwards:** Move upwards to (1.75, 7.5) to avoid going towards the obstacle.
3. **Navigate Right:** Move right, passing the obstacle, towards the breakpoint at (5.12, 7.5). 
4. **Pass Breakpoint:** Continue slightly past the breakpoint to (5.5, 7.5) to ensure a safe distance from the obstacle.
5. **Navigate Downwards:** Move downwards towards the goal set at (5.5, 8.75).
6. **End:** Reach the final destination within the goal set at (9.0, 8.75).

Therefore, a viable path considering the given constraints is:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75), 
    (1.75, 7.5), 
    (5.12, 7.5),
    (5.5, 7.5),
    (5.5, 8.75),
    (9.0, 8.75) 
]
```

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.

		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 10:21:00 AM] The initial path attempts to move upwards directly from the start set, which leads to a collision with Obstacle 1.  To correct this, we need to navigate around Obstacle 1.  One approach is to move towards the right, pass above Obstacle 1, and then head upwards to reach the breakpoint. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start point
    (3.5, 1.75),  # Move right, staying below Obstacle 1
    (3.5, 7.5),  # Move upwards, clear of Obstacle 1
    (5.12, 7.5),  # Move right to the breakpoint 
    (5.5, 7.5),   # Continue right slightly to avoid breakpoint
    (5.5, 8.75),  # Move upwards 
    (9.0, 8.75)   # Move right to the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(1.75, 1.75):** Starting point within the start set.
2. **(3.5, 1.75):** Move rightwards, staying below the lower boundary of Obstacle 1.
3. **(3.5, 7.5):**  From here, safely move upwards, clearing the upper boundary of Obstacle 1.
4. **(5.12, 7.5):** Move rightwards to reach the x-coordinate of the breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1.
5. **(5.5, 7.5):** Continue slightly right to avoid passing directly through the breakpoint, ensuring the path segments don't intersect it.
6. **(5.5, 8.75):** Move upwards towards the goal set.
7. **(9.0, 8.75):** Move rightwards to end within the goal set.

This adjusted path avoids Obstacle 1, passes through a breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1, and successfully reaches the goal set.

Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 10:21:27 AM] The issue lies in the second segment of the proposed path, which tries to move directly upwards from the breakpoint. This movement collides with Obstacle 1.  To circumvent this, we can adjust the path to go around Obstacle 1. Since there is no restriction on how many waypoints the path can have, we can guide the path around the obstacle strategically.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),   # Start point (same as before)
    (5.12, 0.56),   # Breakpoint 1 (same as before)
    (6.0, 0.56),   # Move right, clear of Obstacle 1 
    (6.0, 7.5),   # Move upwards, clear of Obstacle 1
    (9.0, 8.75)    # End point (same as before)
] 
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **(6.0, 0.56):**  Instead of moving directly upwards, the path now first moves to the right, staying at the same y-coordinate as the breakpoint. This ensures a safe distance from Obstacle 1.
2. **(6.0, 7.5):** From this new waypoint, the path can now safely move upwards to a point where it can directly approach the goal without intersecting Obstacle 1. 

This new path avoids Obstacle 1 by navigating around it, while still adhering to the start and end set requirements and passing through the specified breakpoint.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 10:21:43 AM] The issue is with the third segment attempting to go from (6.0, 0.56) vertically upwards to (6.0, 7.5).  This path directly intersects Obstacle 1. 

Let's adjust the path to navigate around Obstacle 1. Since we already used the breakpoint in Set 1, we need to find a way around the obstacle to reach the goal set. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start point
    (5.12, 0.56),   # Breakpoint 
    (7.0, 0.56),   # Move right, clear of Obstacle 1 
    (7.0, 9.0),   # Move upwards, clear of Obstacle 1 
    (9.0, 8.75)    # Goal point
] 
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Move Right, Then Up:** Instead of trying to go up directly, we first hug the bottom edge of Obstacle 1 by moving right to (7.0, 0.56).  
2. **Clear Upwards:** Once we are safely to the right of the obstacle, we can move vertically upwards to (7.0, 9.0), bypassing Obstacle 1 entirely.
3. **Reach the Goal:** Finally, we can move horizontally left to reach our desired endpoint within the goal set. 

This adjusted path avoids all obstacles while still meeting the requirements of starting in the start set, passing through a breakpoint, and ending in the goal set.

[08/27/2024 10:22:12 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid crossing Obstacle 1.  Since we need to pass through (5.12, 0.56) and (5.12, 9.44), we can route the path around Obstacle 1 by utilizing x-coordinates outside of the obstacle's range (1.0 to 9.0).

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),   # Starting point
    (5.12, 0.56),   # Breakpoint 1 
    (0.5, 0.56),    # Move outside Obstacle 1 to the left 
    (0.5, 9.44),    # Move upwards
    (5.12, 9.44),   # Breakpoint 2
    (9.0, 9.44),   # Continue to the previous waypoint
    (9.0, 8.75)    # End point 
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Start:** The path begins at (1.75, 1.75), inside the start set.
2. **Breakpoint 1:**  The path reaches the first breakpoint (5.12, 0.56).
3. **Maneuver around Obstacle:** Instead of going directly upwards, the path moves to (0.5, 0.56), safely to the left of Obstacle 1.
4. **Vertical Movement:** From there, it moves vertically to (0.5, 9.44), clearing the top of Obstacle 1. 
5. **Breakpoint 2:** The path connects to the second breakpoint at (5.12, 9.44).
6. **Final Approach:** The path continues to (9.0, 9.44) and finally to (9.0, 8.75), ending within the goal set. 

This adjusted path successfully navigates around Obstacle 1 while passing through the required breakpoints and staying within the start and goal sets.
