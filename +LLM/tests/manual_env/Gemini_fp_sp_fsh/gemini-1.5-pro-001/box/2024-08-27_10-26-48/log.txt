# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 0.56), (5.12, 9.44)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [

[08/27/2024 10:26:59 AM] The provided environment has a large open space between the start and goal areas, with the single obstacle situated to the right and spanning vertically along the space.  

The path can be planned to first move upward, avoiding the obstacle entirely, then proceed rightward toward the goal, and finally descend into the goal area.

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start within the start set
    (1.75, 7.5),   # Move upward, well above Obstacle 1
    (5.12, 9.44),  # Pass through the upper breakpoint of Breakpoint Set 1

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

### Example Response

    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 10:27:16 AM] The problem lies in the second waypoint (1.75, 7.5) as it is located inside Obstacle 1. To circumvent this, the path should navigate around this obstacle. One approach is to use the provided breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1, which lies outside the obstacle and provides a safe passage. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Starting inside the start set
    (3.0, 1.75),  # Move right, staying clear of Obstacle 1
    (5.12, 0.56),  # Utilize the breakpoint to navigate around Obstacle 1
    (5.12, 9.44),  # Pass through the other breakpoint
    (9.0, 9.0)    # Reach the goal set
]

This revised path avoids crossing Obstacle 1 by going around it, utilizing the breakpoints as waypoints. Each segment is analyzed for potential collisions, ensuring a valid and safe path from the start to the goal.

One option is to route the path above Obstacle 1.  This can be achieved by adding waypoints that go above the obstacle and then connect to the breakpoint above the obstacle:

[08/27/2024 10:27:33 AM] The current path collides with Obstacle 1 because it attempts to go vertically through it.  We need to find a way around.  The valid subpath ends at a breakpoint which is helpful.
