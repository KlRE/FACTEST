# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 0.56), (5.12, 9.44)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 10:26:03 AM] The provided environment has a large obstacle encompassing most of the space between the start and goal regions. However, there's a clear path available by navigating around the obstacle. 

Here's a possible path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),    # Start within the start set
    (1.25, 1.75),    # Move slightly left to avoid the obstacle's corner
    (1.25, 0.0),     # Move down, staying clear of the obstacle
    (5.12, 0.56),    # Pass through the breakpoint of Set 1
    (6.0, 0.0),     # Continue moving right, maintaining distance from the obstacle
    (9.0, 0.0),     # Stay below the obstacle
    (9.0, 9.0),     # Move upwards, clear of the obstacle 
    (9.0, 9.25)      # End within the goal set
] 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Start:** The path begins within the start set at (1.75, 1.75).
2. **Maneuvering around the obstacle:**  The path first moves slightly left to avoid the obstacle's top-left corner, then goes downwards, staying clear of the obstacle's left side.
3. **Breakpoint:**  The path strategically passes through the breakpoint (5.12, 0.56) from Set 1.
4. **Continuing towards the goal:** After the breakpoint, the path maintains a safe distance from the obstacle's bottom, moving rightwards and then upwards to reach the goal set. 
5. **Goal:** The path successfully ends within the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.

		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 10:26:20 AM] The current path attempts to reach the goal by going below the obstacle. However, the feedback indicates that the segment connecting (9.0, 0.0) and (9.0, 9.0) crosses Obstacle 1. 

We can adjust the path to go above Obstacle 1 instead. Since we already have a valid subpath leading to (9.0, 0.0), let's continue from there:

1. **From (9.0, 0.0):**  Move upwards to a y-coordinate greater than the obstacle's highest point (y=5.0). For safety, let's target (9.0, 5.5).
2. **From (9.0, 5.5):** We are now above the obstacle. Move left towards the goal set, reaching a point like (9.0, 9.0), which is safely within the goal set.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [(1.75, 1.75), (1.25, 1.75), (1.25, 0.0), (5.12, 0.56), (6.0, 0.0), (9.0, 0.0), (9.0, 5.5), (9.0, 9.0)]

[08/27/2024 10:26:35 AM] The initial path goes around the obstacle correctly, but then it tries to cross it directly. We should instead leverage the breakpoint offered within Breakpoint Set 1 at (5.12, 9.44). 

Therefore, from the last valid point (9.0, 0.0), the path should move vertically upward to (9.0, 9.44), then horizontally to the left towards (5.12, 9.44) to utilize the breakpoint. From there, we can navigate safely to the goal position.

Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 10:26:48 AM] The current path attempts to go around the obstacle from below, but fails to navigate to the goal from there. Instead, let's use the breakpoint provided in the upper portion of the environment. 

From the last valid point, (9.0, 0.0), we need to navigate upwards, avoiding the obstacle. We can do this by:

1.  Moving rightwards to a point beyond the x-coordinate of the obstacle.
2.  Then, moving upwards to align with the y-coordinate of the upper breakpoint. 
3.  Finally, moving leftwards to reach the breakpoint and proceed to the goal set.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75), 
    (1.25, 1.75), 
    (1.25, 0.0), 
    (5.12, 0.56), 
    (6.0, 0.0), 
    (9.0, 0.0),
    (10.0, 0.0),  # Move right, clear of the obstacle 
    (10.0, 9.44), # Move up to the breakpoint's y-coordinate
    (5.12, 9.44), # Move left to reach the breakpoint
    (9.0, 9.0)   # Proceed to the goal 
]
```
