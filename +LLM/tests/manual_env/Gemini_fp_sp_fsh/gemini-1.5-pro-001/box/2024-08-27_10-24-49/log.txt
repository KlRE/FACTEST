# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 0.56), (5.12, 9.44)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 10:25:00 AM] The provided environment has a large open space between the start and goal sets with the single obstacle positioned to the right. This allows for straightforward path planning. We can choose a path that moves directly towards the goal set and adjusts slightly to pass through the designated breakpoint. 

Here's a possible path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start within the start set
    (5.12, 2.5),   # Approach the breakpoint while maintaining a safe distance from Obstacle 1
    (5.12, 9.44),  # Pass through the breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1
    (9.0, 9.0)    # End within the goal set 
]
```

This path avoids intersecting Obstacle 1 by maintaining a safe distance and successfully navigates to the goal set while passing through a designated breakpoint.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.

		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 10:25:19 AM] The issue is that the second waypoint attempts to move through Obstacle 1. We need to find a way to navigate around this obstacle. 

One strategy could be to route the path above Obstacle 1, leveraging the breakpoint (5.12, 9.44).  Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),    # Start within the start set
    (1.75, 6.0),     # Move vertically upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 1 
    (5.12, 6.0),     # Move horizontally towards the breakpoint, maintaining a safe distance from Obstacle 1 
    (5.12, 9.44),    # Reach the breakpoint 
    (9.0, 9.0)      # Move to the goal set 
]
```

This adjusted path aims to:

1. **Start** at a safe point within the start set.
2. **Ascend:** Move vertically upwards to a y-coordinate greater than the obstacle's maximum y-coordinate. 
3. **Approach Breakpoint:** Move horizontally towards the breakpoint, ensuring a safe distance from Obstacle 1.
4. **Reach Breakpoint:** Arrive at the breakpoint.
5. **Reach Goal:** Move to a suitable endpoint within the goal set. 

This path attempts to avoid crossing any obstacles by maneuvering around Obstacle 1.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start within the start set
    (5.12, 0.56),  # Move to the breakpoint to avoid Obstacle 1

[08/27/2024 10:25:47 AM] The issue is that the second segment of the path directly crosses the obstacle. To avoid this, we need to adjust the path to go around the obstacle. Since we have to use the provided breakpoints, the path needs to navigate around the obstacle while incorporating these points.

Here's one approach:

1. **Valid Subpath:** We can keep the first breakpoint (5.12, 0.56) as it lies outside the obstacle. 

2. **Navigating Around:**  Instead of going vertically straight up to the second breakpoint, we can guide the path around the obstacle. Since the obstacle is rectangular, we can move horizontally to the right, clearing the obstacle's x-coordinate range (x=9) before moving upwards. 

3. **Reaching the Second Breakpoint:** Once clear of the obstacle, we can move upwards to reach the second breakpoint (5.12, 9.44). 

4. **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, from the second breakpoint, we can move towards the goal set.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Starting point
    (5.12, 0.56),  # First breakpoint 
    (9.1, 0.56),  # Move horizontally, clearing the obstacle
    (9.1, 9.44),  # Move upwards, reaching the second breakpoint
    (9.0, 9.0)   # Final point within the goal set 
]
```

This new path avoids the obstacle by going around it while still utilizing both provided breakpoints.
