# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 0.56), (5.12, 9.44)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 10:23:19 AM] The provided breakpoint lies below the obstacle, suggesting a path that navigates beneath Obstacle 1. 

Starting within the start set, the path can move downwards, aiming for a point below the obstacle's lower left corner.  From there, it can proceed rightwards, passing safely beneath Obstacle 1 and approaching the breakpoint. After passing the breakpoint, the path can then move upwards towards the goal set.

Here's a possible representation of this path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),    // Start within the start set
    (1.75, 0.5),     // Move down, staying clear below Obstacle 1
    (5.12, 0.56),    // Pass through the breakpoint
    (5.12, 2.0),     // Move upward, clearing the obstacle
    (9.0, 9.0)      // End within the goal set 
] 
```

[08/27/2024 10:23:28 AM] The issue arises when we try to connect the breakpoint (5.12, 0.56) back to the path. A straight line to (5.12, 2.0) directly intersects Obstacle 1.  

Let's adjust the path to navigate around Obstacle 1:

1. **Valid Subpath:** We can utilize the valid subpath provided: [(1.75, 1.75), (1.75, 0.5), (5.12, 0.56)]. 

2. **Navigating Upwards:** From (5.12, 0.56), we need to move upwards to bypass the obstacle. We can add a waypoint above Obstacle 1, ensuring it's outside the obstacle's boundaries. Let's choose (5.12, 6.0).

3. **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, we can connect to the goal set. A safe waypoint within the goal set is (9.0, 9.0).

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [(1.75, 1.75), (1.75, 0.5), (5.12, 0.56), (5.12, 6.0), (9.0, 9.0)] 
```

This path starts within the start set, passes through a breakpoint, avoids Obstacle 1, and ends within the goal set.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 10:23:43 AM] The feedback correctly identified that the path crosses Obstacle 1.  We'll adjust the path to go around this obstacle.

**Analysis:**

* **Valid Subpath:** The path is valid until the breakpoint (5.12, 0.56).
* **Obstacle Position:** Obstacle 1 stretches vertically across the space, with its left edge at x=1 and right edge at x=9.
* **Goal Location:** The goal is located on the right side of the obstacle (higher x-value).

**Strategy:**

1. **Continue from Valid Subpath:** We'll keep the first three waypoints of the path: (1.75, 1.75), (1.75, 0.5), (5.12, 0.56).
2. **Navigate Around Obstacle:** Since the obstacle stretches across the entire y-axis, we need to navigate either above or below it.  Since the first breakpoint set includes a point above the obstacle, we'll try going above.
3. **Reach Breakpoint:** We'll guide the path upwards to the breakpoint above the obstacle: (5.12, 9.44).
4. **Reach Goal:** Finally, from the breakpoint, we'll move horizontally to a point within the goal set: (9.0, 9.0).

**New Path:**

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 10:23:51 AM] The issue arises when we try to connect the breakpoint (5.12, 0.56) vertically upwards to (5.12, 9.44).  This line segment directly cuts through Obstacle 1. 

Let's adjust the path to go around Obstacle 1. Since the longest valid subpath ends near the bottom-left corner of the obstacle, we can try navigating around it clockwise.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  
    (1.75, 0.5), 
    (5.12, 0.56),
    (6.0, 0.5),   # Move slightly right 
    (6.0, 9.0),   # Move up, clear of Obstacle 1
    (9.0, 9.0)    # Move right to the goal set
] 
```

This path:

1. Starts within the start set.
2. Uses the first breakpoint (5.12, 0.56).
3. Navigates around Obstacle 1 by going right and then up.
4. Ends within the goal set. 

Let me know if you'd like to explore other path options or have further questions!

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(1.75, 1.75), (1.75, 0.5), (5.12, 0.56), (6.0, 0.5)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

Starting from the last valid waypoint (6.0, 0.5), we need to navigate to the goal set while circumventing Obstacle 1.  We can achieve this by:

1. **Moving Right:** Continue horizontally to the right, increasing the x-coordinate until we clear Obstacle 1. A safe distance seems to be around x = 9.0. 
2. **Moving Upwards:** From (9.0, 0.5), we can move upwards, increasing the y-coordinate to reach the goal set.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 10:24:34 AM] The feedback indicates that the path collides with Obstacle 1 when moving directly upwards from (9.0, 0.5) to (9.0, 9.5).  

To circumvent this, we can leverage the fact that the valid subpath already brought us close to the breakpoint (5.12, 9.44) of Breakpoint Set 1. 

Instead of directly moving upwards, we can modify the path as follows:

1. **From the last valid waypoint (9.0, 0.5), move leftwards to a point (x, 0.5) where x < 9.0 to create some distance from the obstacle.** This ensures we avoid crossing Obstacle 1's top edge. 
2. **Move upwards to (x, 9.44), passing through the breakpoint.** This avoids Obstacle 1 completely.
3. **Finally, move rightwards to (9.5, 9.44), ending within the goal set.**

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75), 
    (1.75, 0.5), 
    (5.12, 0.56), 
    (6.0, 0.5), 
    (9.0, 0.5), 
    (8.0, 0.5),  # Move left to avoid obstacle 
    (8.0, 9.44), # Move up to breakpoint
    (9.5, 9.44)   # Move right to goal set
]
```

This path successfully avoids Obstacle 1 while satisfying all other requirements.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:

    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 10:24:48 AM] The issue arises when the path tries to move from (8.0, 0.5) upwards to reach the breakpoint (8.0, 9.44), directly crossing Obstacle 1. To avoid this, we can utilize the fact that the longest valid subpath already brings us close to the goal set. 

Instead of moving upwards, we can add a waypoint to the right, going around the obstacle, and then proceed to the goal set.

Here's the adjusted path:

new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75), 
    (1.75, 0.5), 
    (5.12, 0.56), 
    (6.0, 0.5), 
    (9.0, 0.5),
    (9.5, 0.5),  # New waypoint to move right
    (9.5, 9.44)  # Reach the goal set 
]
