# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 0.56), (5.12, 9.44)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 10:16:50 AM] The provided environment presents a challenge with Obstacle 1 forming a diagonal barrier across the space. To navigate this, the path needs to leverage the provided breakpoints and carefully maneuver around the obstacle.

- Starting within the start set, the path can begin at a point like (1.75, 1.75). 
- It can then proceed towards the first breakpoint (5.12, 0.56) to circumvent the lower end of Obstacle 1. 
- After clearing the obstacle, the path can ascend towards the goal set, ensuring it remains clear of Obstacle 1's upper boundary. 

Here's a possible representation of this path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),    // Start within the start set
    (5.12, 0.56),    // Pass through Breakpoint Set 1
    (6.0, 2.0),      // Maneuver around Obstacle 1 
    (7.0, 4.0),      // Continue towards the goal set
    (9.0, 8.0)       // End within the goal set 
]
```

This path avoids crossing Obstacle 1 by navigating below its lower edge and then ascending towards the goal set while staying clear of its upper edge. Remember to visually verify this path against a drawn representation of the environment to confirm obstacle avoidance.

### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 10:17:01 AM] The current path fails because the segment connecting the breakpoint (5.12, 0.56) to (6.0, 2.0) cuts through Obstacle 1. 

To correct this, we can leverage the fact that the valid subpath ends at the breakpoint (5.12, 0.56), which is below Obstacle 1. We can continue the path by moving further right, avoiding the x-coordinates of Obstacle 1, and then moving upwards towards the goal. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start point
    (5.12, 0.56),  # Breakpoint Set 1 
    (6.0, 0.56),  # Move right to clear Obstacle 1's x-range
    (6.0, 9.0),   # Move up to clear Obstacle 1's y-range 
    (9.0, 9.0)    # Move right to the goal set 
]
```

This path avoids Obstacle 1 by staying to its right and then moving upward when it's clear. Finally, it moves right to reach the goal set.

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 10:17:21 AM] The feedback correctly identifies that the proposed path collides with Obstacle 1. The problem arises when moving vertically from (6.0, 0.56) to (6.0, 9.0). 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Valid Subpath:** We can utilize the valid subpath provided:  [(1.75, 1.75), (5.12, 0.56), (6.0, 0.56)].
2. **Circumventing the Obstacle:** Instead of moving straight up, we need to navigate around Obstacle 1.  We can achieve this by moving further to the right before moving upwards.
3. **Reaching the Goal:** Once we've cleared Obstacle 1, we can safely move towards the goal set.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  
    (5.12, 0.56), 
    (6.0, 0.56),  
    (7.0, 0.56),   # Move further right, clear of Obstacle 1
    (7.0, 9.0),   # Now move upwards
    (9.0, 9.0)    # Reach the goal set
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

* We added waypoints (7.0, 0.56) and (7.0, 9.0) to guide the path around the right side of Obstacle 1. 
* This ensures that no segment of the path intersects the obstacle.

This new path successfully starts in the start set, avoids Obstacle 1, passes through a breakpoint, and ends in the goal set.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 0.56), (5.12, 9.44)]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.75, 1.75), (5.12, 0.56), (6.0, 0.56), (6.0, 9.0), (9.0, 9.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 3 between points (6.0, 0.56) and (6.0, 9.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(1.75, 1.75), (5.12, 0.56), (6.0, 0.56)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 10:17:47 AM] The issue is with the third segment of the path going from (6.0, 0.56) vertically to (6.0, 9.0). This segment attempts to cross directly through Obstacle 1. 

Since we already used the breakpoint in Set 1 to navigate around the obstacle initially, we need to find a new path that avoids going through the obstacle. 

Here's a possible adjustment to the path:

1.  **Valid Subpath:** We can keep the first two waypoints of the path as they successfully navigate to the breakpoint and avoid the obstacle: [(1.75, 1.75), (5.12, 0.56)].

2.  **Navigating around Obstacle 1:** From (5.12, 0.56), we need to navigate around Obstacle 1 to reach the goal set.  We can achieve this by moving further to the right before moving upwards.

3.  **Reaching the Goal Set:**  After clearing Obstacle 1, we can move upwards and then adjust our course to enter the goal set.

Based on this strategy, here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75), 
    (5.12, 0.56), 
    (7.0, 0.56), # Move further right, clear of Obstacle 1
    (7.0, 9.0),   # Move upwards 
    (9.0, 9.0)    # Move into the goal set
] 
```

This adjusted path avoids crossing Obstacle 1 and successfully reaches the goal set while still utilizing a breakpoint from Set 1.

[08/27/2024 10:17:58 AM] The feedback correctly points out that the path segment between (7.0, 0.56) and (7.0, 9.0) crosses Obstacle 1. To fix this, we need to find a way around this obstacle.

Since we already used the breakpoint (5.12, 0.56) from Set 1, let's try using the other breakpoint from this set to navigate around Obstacle 1.

From (5.12, 0.56), we can move to (5.12, 9.44) to reach the second breakpoint. This movement is valid as it doesn't intersect any obstacles. 

After reaching (5.12, 9.44), we can move horizontally to the right to reach the goal set. A possible endpoint within the goal set is (9.0, 9.0).

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [

[08/27/2024 10:18:07 AM] The current path attempts to cross the obstacle by going from a breakpoint below it to a breakpoint above. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around the obstacle. Since the obstacle spans from x=1 to x=9, the path needs to either go around the left or right side of the obstacle.

The left side is blocked by the starting set, so the path needs to go around the right side of the obstacle.  We can achieve this by maintaining an x-coordinate greater than 9 until reaching the y-coordinate of the goal set. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [

### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 10:18:19 AM] The previous path went too low and intersected with the obstacle. It also did not reach the goal set or pass through a breakpoint. 

The adjusted path will prioritize:
1. **Reaching a Breakpoint:** Navigate towards the breakpoint (5.12, 9.44) from the start.
2. **Goal Set Entry:** After the breakpoint, proceed towards a suitable entry point in the goal set. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Start within the start set
    (5.12, 9.44),  # Pass through the breakpoint

[08/27/2024 10:18:33 AM] The provided path goes directly towards the breakpoint but unfortunately crosses obstacle 1. To circumvent this, the path needs to navigate around the obstacle. Given the obstacle's shape, going around its top seems like the most efficient route.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Starting point within the start set.
    (1.0, 1.75),  # Move slightly left to avoid the starting corner of the obstacle.
    (1.0, 6.0),  # Move upwards, safely clearing the obstacle.
    (5.12, 9.44),  # Head towards the breakpoint, now clear of the obstacle.
    (9.0, 9.0)   # Proceed to the goal set.
]
```

This path first makes a small adjustment to avoid the immediate corner of the obstacle, then moves vertically to bypass it entirely before proceeding to the breakpoint and finally the goal.

To circumvent this, we can leverage the provided breakpoint (5.12, 9.44) in Breakpoint Set 1.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),   # Starting inside the start set
    (1.75, 3.0),    # Moving upwards to avoid the lower part of Obstacle 1
    (5.12, 3.0),    # Moving rightwards towards the breakpoint while staying clear of Obstacle 1
    (5.12, 9.44),   # Reaching the breakpoint 
    (9.0, 9.0)     # Moving to a point within the goal set 
]

This path avoids crossing Obstacle 1 by first moving upwards and then rightwards to reach the breakpoint. From there, it's a clear path to the goal set.

[08/27/2024 10:19:04 AM] The current path goes straight up from the starting point, directly into Obstacle 1. To avoid this, we should route the path around the right side of the obstacle.

Here's the adjusted path:

[08/27/2024 10:19:11 AM] The problem identified is that the second waypoint (5.5, 1.75) is located inside Obstacle 1. To circumvent this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle. 

Given the obstacle's shape and position, we can choose to go above it. We can achieve this by routing the path upwards before reaching the obstacle and then moving towards the goal.

Here’s a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Starting point remains the same
    (1.75, 6.0),  # Move upwards to a point clearly above the obstacle 
    (5.12, 9.44), # Connect to the breakpoint 
    (9.0, 9.0)   # Proceed to the goal
]
```

This adjusted path avoids Obstacle 1 by going above it, successfully connects to the breakpoint, and finally reaches the goal.

[08/27/2024 10:19:22 AM] The initial path goes upwards and hits the obstacle. We need to find a way around the obstacle. 

There are two main options to get around the obstacle: to the left or to the right. Since the obstacle spans the entire height of the environment, going to the left would require a very long detour. Going to the right seems more promising. 

Starting at (1.75, 1.75), we can move rightwards, avoiding the obstacle, and aim for the breakpoint (5.12, 9.44).  After reaching the breakpoint, we can move towards the goal set.

[08/27/2024 10:19:30 AM] The issue arises when the path tries to move horizontally from the start set to the breakpoint. This segment crosses obstacle 1. To circumvent this, the path needs to navigate above obstacle 1.

Here's how we can adjust the path:

1. **Start:** Keep the starting point at (1.75, 1.75).
2. **Navigate Upward:** Move vertically upward to a point above obstacle 1. A suitable waypoint could be (1.75, 6.0).
3. **Navigate Rightward:**  Move horizontally towards the breakpoint set. A suitable waypoint could be (5.12, 6.0)
4. **Reach Breakpoint:** Move down to the breakpoint (5.12, 9.44)
5. **Navigate to Goal:** Move horizontally towards the goal set. We can go directly to a point within the goal set, like (9.0, 9.0).

Therefore, the adjusted path is:

```
new_path = [(1.75, 1.75), (1.75, 6.0), (5.12, 6.0), (5.12, 9.44), (9.0, 9.0)]
```

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 1 between points (1.75, 1.75) and (1.75, 6.0) intersects with obstacle(s):

[08/27/2024 10:19:41 AM] The initial path went through Obstacle 1. To avoid this, we can route the path above the obstacle. 

Starting at (1.75, 1.75), we can move upwards to a point above Obstacle 1, like (1.75, 6.0). 

From there, we can move rightwards, passing breakpoint (5.12, 9.44) from Breakpoint Set 1 and then continue to the goal set.

Here's the adjusted path:

[08/27/2024 10:20:20 AM] The previous path failed because it tried to cross Obstacle 1 vertically. 
To reach the goal set, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle. 

The provided breakpoint (5.12, 0.56) seems useful as it allows us to go around the obstacle from the right side.  

From the breakpoint, we can move horizontally to the right, clearing the obstacle. Then, we can move upwards to the same y-coordinate as the goal set. Finally, we can move horizontally to the left to enter the goal set.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75),  # Starting inside the start set
    (5.12, 0.56),  # Using the provided breakpoint
    (6.0, 0.56),  # Moving horizontally to the right, clearing Obstacle 1
    (6.0, 9.0),   # Moving vertically to the same y-coordinate as the goal set
    (9.0, 9.0)    # Moving horizontally to the left and ending inside the goal set 
]

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [1.5, 2.0], [1.5, 1.5], [2.0, 1.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.5, 9.5], [8.5, 9.5], [8.5, 8.5], [9.5, 8.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(5.12, 0.56), (5.12, 9.44)]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(1.75, 1.75), (5.12, 0.56), (6.0, 0.56), (6.0, 9.0), (9.0, 9.0)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 3 between points (6.0, 0.56) and (6.0, 9.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 1: [[1.0, 5.0], [5.0, 1.0], [9.0, 5.0], [5.0, 9.0]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(1.75, 1.75), (5.12, 0.56), (6.0, 0.56)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 10:20:34 AM] The current path collides with Obstacle 1 because it attempts to go from a low y-value to a high y-value while staying at a x-value of 6.0, which is within the x-range of the obstacle. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around the obstacle. One way is to go around the left side of the obstacle, taking advantage of the available space:

1. **Start:** Keep the start point and the first waypoint of the valid subpath the same, as it correctly navigates to the breakpoint:  (1.75, 1.75), (5.12, 0.56) 
2. **Navigate Left:** Instead of immediately moving upwards, continue moving left to clearly bypass the obstacle: (0.5, 0.56)
3. **Move Upwards:** With sufficient clearance, move upwards to a y-value greater than the obstacle's maximum y-value: (0.5, 9.5) 
4. **Reach Goal:** Finally, move rightwards to the desired endpoint within the goal set: (9.0, 9.0)

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (1.75, 1.75), 
    (5.12, 0.56), 
    (0.5, 0.56), 
    (0.5, 9.5), 
    (9.0, 9.0) 
]
