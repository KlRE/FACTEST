# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.0, 1.0], [8.0, 1.0], [8.0, -0.0], [9.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 02:42:26 PM] The previous attempt failed because the straight line path from (0.5, -3.0) to (4.0, -4.0) cut through Obstacle 1. 

Let's adjust the path to go around Obstacle 1.  We can leverage the breakpoint at (4.0, 3.0) to navigate around the obstacle. 

Here's a possible approach:

1. **Start:** Keep the starting point (0.5, 0.5).
2. **Navigate around Obstacle 1:** Guide the path above Obstacle 1. A possible waypoint could be (2.0, 3.0) which is above the obstacle. 
3. **Reach the breakpoint:** From (2.0, 3.0) move to the breakpoint (4.0, 3.0).
4. **Reach the goal:** Finally, from the breakpoint, navigate to a point within the goal set, for instance,  (9.0, 0.5).

**New Path:**
```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (2.0, 3.0), 
    (4.0, 3.0), 
    (9.0, 0.5)
]
```

This new path avoids crossing Obstacle 1 by going above it and also ensures passing through a breakpoint.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 02:42:39 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 1. The breakpoint (4.0, 3.0) itself is not problematic, but the direct connection to the goal set crosses the obstacle. 

Instead of directly connecting to the goal set, let's route the path around Obstacle 1. Since the obstacle extends from y = -4.0 to y = 4.0, we need to navigate around it either from above or below. 

Given the goal set's location, it seems more efficient to go above. We can achieve this by adding a waypoint to the right of Obstacle 1 and then connecting to the goal set.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start point
    (2.0, 3.0),  # Approach breakpoint
    (4.0, 3.0),  # Breakpoint
    (7.0, 3.0),  # Move right, staying above Obstacle 1
    (9.0, 0.5)   # Connect to the goal set

]

[08/27/2024 02:42:47 PM] The current path collides with Obstacle 1 because it attempts to move directly horizontally from the breakpoint (4.0, 3.0). To avoid this, we can route the path downwards, going around the obstacle. 

Here's a possible adjustment:

1. **From the valid subpath:**  We can continue from the last valid point (4.0, 3.0).
2. **Going around the obstacle:** To avoid Obstacle 1, we need to go below its lowest y-coordinate (y = -4.0).
3. **Reaching the goal set:** From a point below Obstacle 1, we can move directly rightwards to enter the goal set.

Considering these points, here's a possible adjusted path:

```

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.0, 1.0], [8.0, 1.0], [8.0, -0.0], [9.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.0, -4.0), (4.0, 3.0)]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, 3.0), (4.0, 3.0), (4.0, -4.5), (9.0, -4.5), (8.5, 0.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 3 between points (4.0, 3.0) and (4.0, -4.5) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, 3.0), (4.0, 3.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 02:43:05 PM] The current path collides with Obstacle 1 because it attempts to go directly down from (4.0, 3.0) to (4.0, -4.5). 

We need to find a way to navigate around Obstacle 1 while still passing through the required breakpoint. 

**Option 1: Going around the left side of Obstacle 1**

* From the last valid point (4.0, 3.0), we could try moving further left, then down, and finally right towards the goal. This would involve navigating around the corner of Obstacle 1 at (2.0, -4.0).

**Option 2: Going around the right side of Obstacle 1**

* Alternatively, we could try moving from (4.0, 3.0) further right, then down, and finally left towards the goal. This would involve navigating around the corner of Obstacle 1 at (7.0, 4.0).

Let's analyze which option is more suitable by looking at the spatial relationships:

- **Option 1** seems more promising because it keeps us further away from the obstacle and provides more space to maneuver. It also sets us up for a smoother approach to the goal set. 

Therefore, let's try adjusting the path by going around the left side of Obstacle 1:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start
    (2.0, 3.0), 
    (4.0, 3.0),   # Breakpoint 1
    (1.5, 3.0),   # Move left to clear Obstacle 1
    (1.5, -5.0),  # Move down, staying clear of Obstacle 1
    (9.0, -5.0),  # Move right towards the goal set
    (8.5, 0.5)   # End
]
```

This new path avoids Obstacle 1 by maneuvering around its left side while still satisfying all the requirements:

- It starts within the start set.
- It ends within the goal set.
- It passes through a breakpoint from Breakpoint Set 1. 
- It avoids crossing any obstacles.
