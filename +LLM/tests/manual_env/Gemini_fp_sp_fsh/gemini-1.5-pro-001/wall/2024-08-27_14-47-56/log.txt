# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.0, 1.0], [8.0, 1.0], [8.0, -0.0], [9.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.0, -4.0), (4.0, 3.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 02:48:05 PM] The path needs to navigate around Obstacle 1 to reach the goal set. We can achieve this by first moving downwards, then maneuvering around the obstacle to the right, and finally heading towards the goal.

Here's a possible path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.0),    # Start within the start set
    (0.5, -3.0),   # Move downwards 
    (4.0, -4.0),   # Pass through Breakpoint Set 1 while maneuvering around Obstacle 1
    (7.0, -3.0),   # Continue moving rightwards 
    (8.5, 0.0)    # Arrive at the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(0.5, 0.0):** Start at a point within the start set.
2. **(0.5, -3.0):**  Move downwards, creating distance from Obstacle 1.
3. **(4.0, -4.0):** This waypoint serves two purposes: it guides the path around the bottom-left corner of Obstacle 1 and ensures the path passes through a breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1. 
4. **(7.0, -3.0):** Move further right, widening the distance from Obstacle 1 and preparing for the final approach to the goal.
5. **(8.5, 0.0):**  Finally, move upwards to end up within the goal set.

		Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.0, -4.0), (4.0, 3.0)]

    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

    	Segment 2 between points (0.5, -3.0) and (4.0, -4.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.5, 0.0), (0.5, -3.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 02:48:20 PM] The path needs to navigate around obstacle 1 to reach the goal. The valid subpath takes us below the obstacle, and we can leverage the breakpoint in breakpoint set 1 to guide our path.

1. **Start:** We can keep the starting point (0.5, 0.0).
2. **Navigate Below Obstacle 1:** Continue the path downwards to a point below the minimum y-coordinate of Obstacle 1. For instance, (0.5, -5.0).
3. **Reach Breakpoint:** Move towards the breakpoint (4.0, -4.0).
4. **Approach Goal:** Move towards a point directly below the goal set, for example, (8.5, -3.0) to avoid any potential intersections.
5. **Reach Goal:** Finally, move upwards to reach the goal set at (8.5, 0.0).

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.0),  
    (0.5, -5.0), 
    (4.0, -4.0), 
    (8.5, -3.0), 
    (8.5, 0.0)   
]
```
