# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.0, 1.0], [8.0, 1.0], [8.0, -0.0], [9.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.0, -4.0), (4.0, 3.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 02:46:05 PM] The provided obstacles create a sort of "channel" that the path needs to traverse.  We can use the breakpoint (4.0, -4.0) to navigate around the obstacle.

Here's a possible path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),     # Start within the start set
    (3.0, 0.5),     # Move right, staying clear of the obstacle
    (4.0, -4.0),    # Pass through breakpoint 1
    (7.0, -3.0),    # Move towards the goal, staying below the obstacle
    (8.5, 0.5),     # Approach the goal set
    (8.5, 0.5)      # End within the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(0.5, 0.5):** Starts within the start set.
2. **(3.0, 0.5):** Moves rightward, staying well clear of the top of the obstacle. 
3. **(4.0, -4.0):**  Navigates downward to the breakpoint, passing below the obstacle.
4. **(7.0, -3.0):**  Continues rightward, maintaining a safe distance from the obstacle's corner.
5. **(8.5, 0.5):**  Moves upward towards the goal set, ensuring a clear path.
6. **(8.5, 0.5):**  Ends the path within the goal set. 

This path avoids crossing any obstacles and successfully connects the start and goal sets while passing through a breakpoint.

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 02:46:15 PM] The problem is with the second segment of the path crossing obstacle 1. To avoid this, we can make use of the breakpoint provided. 

1. **Start:** Keep the starting point at (0.5, 0.5).

2. **Navigate to Breakpoint:** Guide the path downwards to the breakpoint (4.0, -4.0) to avoid obstacle 1. 

3. **Route Around Obstacle:** From the breakpoint, navigate around the obstacle by moving rightward to a point that has a y-coordinate greater than -4.0 (the lowest point of obstacle 1). For instance, (7.0, -3.0) can be a good waypoint.

4. **Reach the Goal:** Finally, proceed to the goal set. (8.5, 0.5) remains a valid endpoint. 

**Here's the adjusted path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (4.0, -4.0),
    (7.0, -3.0),
    (8.5, 0.5)

[08/27/2024 02:46:23 PM] The first segment of the provided path crosses obstacle 1. We need to find a way to reach the breakpoint (4.0, -4.0) without crossing any obstacles.

Let's analyze the environment:
- Obstacle 1 forms a slanted barrier extending from the lower left to the upper right.
- The provided breakpoint (4.0, -4.0) lies below and to the right of this obstacle.

Considering these factors, we can adjust the path as follows:

1. **Navigate around obstacle 1:** Instead of directly going to the breakpoint, we can first move to the right, staying below obstacle 1.
2. **Reach the breakpoint:** Once we are past the obstacle, we can move downwards to reach the breakpoint (4.0, -4.0).
3. **Proceed to the goal:** From the breakpoint, we can safely move towards the goal area.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),      // Start in the start set
    (2.0, -2.0),     // Move right and down, staying below obstacle 1
    (4.0, -4.0),     // Reach the breakpoint
    (7.0, -3.0),     // Continue towards the goal 
    (8.5, 0.5)      // End inside the goal set
] 
```

This adjusted path avoids crossing obstacle 1 and successfully reaches the goal set while passing through the breakpoint.

[08/27/2024 02:46:31 PM] The issue arises when trying to connect the valid subpath endpoint (2.0, -2.0) to the breakpoint (4.0, -4.0).  This segment cuts through Obstacle 1. To circumvent this, we can leverage the other breakpoint (4.0, 3.0). 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

1. **Start:** (0.5, 0.5) - Remains valid within the start set.
2. **Navigate Upwards:** (2.0, 3.0) -  Avoids Obstacle 1 by moving vertically.
3. **Reach Breakpoint:** (4.0, 3.0) - Successfully hits the second breakpoint in Set 1.
4. **Descend Towards Goal:** (6.0, 1.0) -  Avoids Obstacle 1 by passing to its right.
5. **End:** (8.5, 0.5) -  Remains valid within the goal set.

**New Path:**

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.0, 1.0], [8.0, 1.0], [8.0, -0.0], [9.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, 3.0), (4.0, 3.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 02:46:38 PM] The provided path correctly goes through the breakpoint at (4.0, 3.0) and avoids the obstacle up to that point. To avoid intersecting Obstacle 1, the path needs to navigate around it. One option is to continue downwards from the breakpoint and go around the obstacle to the right. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (2.0, 3.0), 
    (4.0, 3.0), 
    (4.0, -2.0),  # Move downwards, staying clear of Obstacle 1 
    (7.0, -2.0),  # Move right, staying clear of Obstacle 1
    (8.5, 0.5)   # Continue to the goal 
]
```

This path maintains a safe distance from Obstacle 1 while still passing through the required breakpoint and reaching the goal set.

[08/27/2024 02:46:45 PM] The problem arises when the path goes from (4.0, 3.0) to (4.0, -2.0), directly through Obstacle 1. 

We can leverage the valid subpath and the provided breakpoints to find a new route:

1. **Valid Subpath:** We start with the valid subpath: [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, 3.0), (4.0, 3.0)].

2. **Breakpoint Utilization:**  We need to pass through a breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.0, -4.0), (4.0, 3.0)]. Notice that (4.0, 3.0) is already part of our valid subpath.

3. **Navigating Around Obstacle:** To avoid Obstacle 1, we can navigate around its left side.

4. **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, we plot a straight course to the goal set.

Therefore, a revised path could be:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (2.0, 3.0), 
    (4.0, 3.0), 
    (2.0, 0.0),  # Move left and down, clear of Obstacle 1
    (7.0, 0.0),  # Move right, towards the goal set

]

[08/27/2024 02:46:52 PM] The valid subpath takes us to the breakpoint (4.0, 3.0), which lies above the obstacle. We can try to navigate around the obstacle from here.

1. **From the breakpoint (4.0, 3.0), move horizontally to the right, towards the goal set.**  We need to stay clear of the obstacle, so let's target a point with an x-coordinate of 7.0 (same as the rightmost point of the obstacle).
2. **To avoid colliding with the obstacle, choose a y-coordinate that is greater than the obstacle's maximum y-coordinate.** The obstacle's highest point has a y-coordinate of 4.0, so let's aim for (7.0, 4.5).
3. **Finally, move straight down to the goal set.**  A suitable endpoint within the goal set could be (8.5, 0.5).

This results in the following corrected path:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, 3.0), (4.0, 3.0), (7.0, 4.5), (8.5, 0.5)]

		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:

[08/27/2024 02:47:11 PM] The issue with the previous path was that the segment connecting (4.0, 3.0) and (7.0, 4.5) directly crossed Obstacle 1. To avoid this, we need to navigate around this obstacle.

We can leverage the provided breakpoint at (4.0, -4.0) to plan a path around the obstacle.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start within the start set
    (2.0, 3.0),   # Maintain a path similar to the valid subpath
    (4.0, 3.0),   # Reach the breakpoint at (4.0, 3.0)
    (4.0, -4.0),  # Utilize the breakpoint to move below Obstacle 1
    (7.0, -4.0),  # Move right, staying below Obstacle 1
    (8.5, 0.5)    # Move diagonally to reach the goal set
]
```

This path first navigates towards the breakpoint (4.0, 3.0) as the initial path did. From there, it strategically uses the breakpoint (4.0, -4.0) to maneuver below Obstacle 1. Finally, it moves right and then diagonally upwards to reach the goal set, successfully avoiding the obstacle.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.

[08/27/2024 02:47:17 PM] The issue arises when the path tries to go directly from (4.0, 3.0) to (4.0, -4.0), crossing through Obstacle 1. To fix this, we need to route the path around the obstacle. 

Since we already have a valid path up to (4.0, 3.0), let's continue from there.  We can navigate to the right side of Obstacle 1 to avoid a collision. Then, we can proceed downwards and move towards the goal set.

Here is a possible adjusted path:

```

    (2.0, 3.0), 
    (4.0, 3.0),

[08/27/2024 02:47:23 PM] The feedback indicated that the path segment between (4.0, 3.0) and (6.5, 3.0) crosses Obstacle 1. To avoid this, the path needs to navigate around this obstacle. 

One approach is to route the path downwards, going below Obstacle 1, and then continue towards the goal. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (2.0, 3.0), 
    (4.0, 3.0),  
    (4.0, -2.0), # Move down, staying clear of Obstacle 1
    (7.0, -2.0), # Move right, staying below Obstacle 1
    (8.5, 0.5)  # Continue to the goal 
]
```

This path first follows the valid subpath, then goes south to bypass the obstacle and then continues east towards the goal. It ensures a safe distance from Obstacle 1 while still satisfying the start and end conditions.

[08/27/2024 02:47:40 PM] The suggested path collides with Obstacle 1 because the line segment from (4.0, 3.0) to (4.0, -2.0) cuts through the obstacle. 

Let's adjust the path to go around Obstacle 1. Since the valid subpath already takes us to the breakpoint (4.0, 3.0), we can continue from there.  We need to guide the path around the obstacle and towards the goal set. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (2.0, 3.0), 
    (4.0, 3.0), 
    (6.0, 3.0),  # Move horizontally to clear the obstacle
    (6.0, -2.0), # Move vertically down, clear of the obstacle
    (7.0, -2.0),
    (8.5, 0.5)  
]
```

This path carefully navigates around Obstacle 1 by first moving horizontally to the right, then vertically down. This ensures no part of the path intersects the obstacle. Finally, it rejoins the original path and reaches the goal set.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.0, 1.0], [8.0, 1.0], [8.0, -0.0], [9.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.0, -4.0), (4.0, 3.0)]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, 3.0), (4.0, 3.0), (6.0, 3.0), (6.0, -2.0), (7.0, -2.0), (8.5, 0.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 3 between points (4.0, 3.0) and (6.0, 3.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, 3.0), (4.0, 3.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 02:47:56 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 1. The provided feedback suggests that the segment connecting (4.0, 3.0) and (6.0, 3.0) intersects with the obstacle.

Let's analyze the environment:
- The valid subpath ends at (4.0, 3.0), which is already at Breakpoint Set 1. 
- We need to find a way to navigate around Obstacle 1 to reach the goal set.
- Obstacle 1 extends significantly below the y-axis, making it difficult to go around it from below.
- Going above seems like a more promising strategy.

Therefore, we can modify the path as follows:

1.  From (4.0, 3.0), move vertically upward to a point above Obstacle 1. For instance, (4.0, 5.0) should be safe.
2.  From (4.0, 5.0), move horizontally rightwards, passing above Obstacle 1, towards the goal set. For example, we can go to (7.0, 5.0). 
3.  From (7.0, 5.0), move vertically downwards to enter the goal set and reach a valid end point, like (8.5, 0.5).

Considering these adjustments, the new path is:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (2.0, 3.0), 
    (4.0, 3.0), 
    (4.0, 5.0),  
    (7.0, 5.0),  
    (8.5, 0.5)  
]
```
