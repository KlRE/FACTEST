# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.0, 1.0], [8.0, 1.0], [8.0, -0.0], [9.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.0, -4.0), (4.0, 3.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 02:34:37 PM] The path needs to navigate around Obstacle 1 to reach the goal. There is enough space to go around the obstacle from below.

The provided breakpoint at (4.0, -4.0) seems helpful in guiding the path around the obstacle.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (0.5, -3.0),   # Move down, keeping clear of Obstacle 1
    (4.0, -4.0),   # Pass through the breakpoint
    (7.0, -3.0),   # Move rightward, maintaining distance from Obstacle 1 
    (8.5, 0.5)    # Move up to the center of the goal set

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 02:34:49 PM] The issue arises when trying to connect the breakpoint (4.0, -4.0) back to the valid subpath ending at (0.5, -3.0). This connection would inevitably cross Obstacle 1. 

Therefore, a new approach is needed, utilizing the breakpoint to reach the goal set.

**New Path Proposal:**

1. **Start:** (0.5, 0.5) -  Within the start set.
2. **Navigate Downwards:** (0.5, -3.0) -  Avoids the top edge of Obstacle 1.
3. **Approach Breakpoint:** (4.0, -3.0) -  Moves directly towards the breakpoint, staying clear of Obstacle 1's right edge.
4. **Utilize Breakpoint:** (4.0, -4.0) - Passes through the breakpoint.
5. **Navigate Right:** (7.0, -4.0) -  Moves right, staying below Obstacle 1. 
6. **Ascend to Goal:** (7.0, 0.5) - Moves upwards, avoiding the corner of Obstacle 1.
7. **Enter Goal Set:** (8.5, 0.5) -  Reaches a point within the goal set.

**New Path in Correct Format:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (0.5, -3.0),
    (4.0, -3.0),
    (4.0, -4.0),
    (7.0, -4.0),
    (7.0, 0.5),
    (8.5, 0.5)
]
```

This new path successfully navigates the obstacles, passes through the breakpoint, and reaches the goal set.

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 02:34:58 PM] The initial path segment goes through obstacle 1. To circumvent this, we can route the path downwards, leveraging the breakpoint at (4.0, -4.0) to navigate around the obstacle. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start within the start set
    (0.5, -3.0), # Move downwards
    (4.0, -3.0), # Move towards the breakpoint
    (4.0, -4.0), # Reach the breakpoint 
    (7.0, -4.0), # Move towards the goal set
    (7.0, 0.5),  # Move upwards 
    (8.5, 0.5)   # End within the goal set
]
```

This revised path avoids crossing obstacle 1 by going around it, ensuring it stays within the defined boundaries and passes through the breakpoint.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 02:35:11 PM] The issue lies in trying to connect to the breakpoint directly with a straight line. We can navigate around the obstacle by going below it and then connecting to the chosen breakpoint. Additionally, the path needs to adjust to reach the goal set.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   
    (0.5, -3.0), 
    (4.0, -3.0), 
    (4.0, -4.0), 
    (7.0, -4.0),  
    (7.0, -1.0),  
    (8.5, -1.0),
    (8.5, 0.5)   
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(0.5, 0.5) to (0.5, -3.0):**  Same as the valid subpath.
2. **(0.5, -3.0) to (4.0, -3.0):** This segment goes below Obstacle 1. 
3. **(4.0, -3.0) to (4.0, -4.0):**  Connects to the breakpoint (4.0, -4.0).
4. **(4.0, -4.0) to (7.0, -4.0):**  Moves further to the right, staying clear of Obstacle 1.
5. **(7.0, -4.0) to (7.0, -1.0):** Moves upwards to avoid any potential obstacles below the goal set and prepare for entry.
6. **(7.0, -1.0) to (8.5, -1.0):** Moves rightwards towards the goal set.
7. **(8.5, -1.0) to (8.5, 0.5):** Moves upwards to end within the goal set. 

This path avoids crossing Obstacle 1, goes through the chosen breakpoint, and successfully reaches the goal set.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.0, 1.0], [8.0, 1.0], [8.0, -0.0], [9.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.0, -4.0), (4.0, 3.0)]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, -3.0), (4.0, -3.0), (4.0, -4.0), (7.0, -4.0), (7.0, -1.0), (8.5, -1.0), (8.5, 0.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 2 between points (0.5, -3.0) and (4.0, -3.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, -3.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 02:35:19 PM] The proposed path collides with Obstacle 1 because it attempts to cross directly through it.  We need to find a way around this obstacle. Let's route the path below Obstacle 1 since it extends further down than the start point.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (0.5, -2.0),   # Move down, clear of the start set 
    (4.0, -2.0),   # Move right, staying below Obstacle 1
    (4.0, -4.0),   # Reach the breakpoint 
    (7.0, -4.0),   # Continue right, staying below Obstacle 1
    (7.0, -1.0),   # Move up, clear of Obstacle 1
    (8.5, -1.0),   # Move right towards the goal set
    (8.5, 0.5)    # End within the goal set 
]
```

This path avoids crossing any obstacles:

- It starts within the start set.
- It moves below Obstacle 1.
- It passes through the breakpoint (4.0, -4.0).
- It ends within the goal set.

]

[08/27/2024 02:35:29 PM] The current path attempts to go below the obstacle, but the second segment crosses the obstacle.  We should instead try to navigate above the obstacle.

- The valid subpath ends at (0.5, -2.0).
- From there, we can try going right towards (4.0, -2.0) again, but this time, we'll make sure to stay below the obstacle.
- We can then proceed to the breakpoint (4.0, -4.0).
- After the breakpoint, we need to move towards the goal set while avoiding the obstacle. We can achieve this by moving right to (7.0, -4.0) and then upwards to (7.0, -1.0).
- Finally, we can move horizontally to the goal set.

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 02:35:38 PM] The suggested path collides with Obstacle 1 because it attempts to move directly to the right at y = -2.0, which cuts through the obstacle. To correct this, the path needs to navigate around the obstacle.

One approach is to route the path below Obstacle 1:

1. **Start:** (0.5, 0.5) - Same as before.
2. **Move Down:** (0.5, -4.5) - Go below Obstacle 1's lowest point.
3. **Navigate Right:** (4.0, -4.5) - Move right, staying below Obstacle 1.
4. **Pass Breakpoint:** (4.0, -4.0) -  Pass through the breakpoint.
5. **Continue Right:** (7.0, -4.0) - Same as before.
6. **Move Up:** (7.0, -1.0) - Same as before.
7. **Reach Goal:** (8.5, -1.0) -  Can simplify and go directly to the goal area.
8. **End:** (8.5, 0.5) - End within the goal set.

**New Path:**

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, -4.5), (4.0, -4.5), (4.0, -4.0), (7.0, -4.0), (7.0, -1.0), (8.5, -1.0), (8.5, 0.5)]
```

This revised path avoids collision with Obstacle 1 by going around its bottom edge, ensuring a valid and safe path to the goal.
