# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.0, 1.0], [8.0, 1.0], [8.0, -0.0], [9.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 4.0], [2.0, -4.0], [3.0, -4.0], [7.0, 4.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(4.0, -4.0), (4.0, 3.0)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 02:45:26 PM] The path needs to navigate around obstacle 1, which spans a significant portion of the y-axis between y = 4 and y = -4. To avoid this, the path can first move towards the breakpoint (4.0, -4.0) and then proceed towards the goal.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start within the start set
    (3.0, -3.0),  # Approach the breakpoint while staying clear of obstacle 1
    (4.0, -4.0),  # Pass through the breakpoint
    (7.0, -3.0),  # Move towards the goal set while maintaining a safe distance from obstacle 1
    (8.5, 0.5)   # End within the goal set 
]

[08/27/2024 02:45:31 PM] The first segment of the suggested path crosses an obstacle, so I need to find a way around it. 

Since the obstacle extends quite far down, I will try to go above it. 

I will keep the first waypoint the same, as it's a valid starting point. 

Then, I will add a waypoint to navigate around the obstacle. Let's try going vertically up first, to avoid the obstacle, then aiming for the breakpoint:

[08/27/2024 02:45:37 PM] The current path collides with Obstacle 1 because it attempts to move directly downwards to the breakpoint. A better approach would be to skirt around Obstacle 1.

We can achieve this by adding a waypoint that goes around the obstacle. Since the valid subpath ends above the obstacle, we can route the path around the left side of the obstacle. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```

[08/27/2024 02:45:50 PM] The problem arises when connecting the waypoint (1.0, -3.0) to the breakpoint (4.0, -4.0), as this segment crosses Obstacle 1. 

To circumvent this, we can adjust the path to go around Obstacle 1. We'll leverage the valid subpath provided: [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 5.0), (1.0, 5.0), (1.0, -3.0)]. 

Instead of going directly to the breakpoint, let's navigate around Obstacle 1:

1.  **From the last valid point (1.0, -3.0):** Move further down to (1.0, -5.0) ensuring we are clear of Obstacle 1's lower boundary.
2.  **Navigate right:** Move horizontally to the right, passing below Obstacle 1. A safe waypoint could be (7.0, -5.0), ensuring we clear the obstacle's rightmost edge.
3.  **Move upwards:**  Head towards the breakpoint (4.0, -4.0).
4.  **Continue to the goal:** After passing through the breakpoint, proceed to a point within the goal set, such as (8.5, 0.5).

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 5.0), (1.0, 5.0), (1.0, -3.0), (1.0, -5.0), (7.0, -5.0), (4.0, -4.0), (8.5, 0.5)] 
```

This revised path successfully avoids Obstacle 1 while adhering to the specified criteria for start and goal positions and passing through a breakpoint.
