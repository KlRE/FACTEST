# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 12:04:55 PM] The path needs to navigate around obstacle 1, which sits to the right, and obstacle 2, which stretches diagonally across the upper left quadrant. 

Here's a possible path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (2.0, -2.5),   # Pass through Breakpoint Set 1 option 1
    (3.0, -1.0),   # Navigate below Obstacle 1, maintaining a safe distance
    (3.5, 0.0),    # Continue moving rightward, still safely below Obstacle 1 
    (4.5, 2.0),    # Begin angling upward toward the goal set, avoiding Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)     # End within the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(0.5, 0.5):**  Starts in the center of the start set.
2. **(2.0, -2.5):**  Moves directly to the first breakpoint option, taking advantage of the open space.
3. **(3.0, -1.0):**  Carefully skirts below the corner of Obstacle 1, ensuring a safe distance.
4. **(3.5, 0.0):**  Continues moving rightward, staying clear of Obstacle 1.
5. **(4.5, 2.0):**  Begins angling upward towards the goal set, strategically navigating the gap between Obstacles 1 and 2.
6. **(4.5, 4.5):**  Successfully reaches a point within the goal set. 

**Important:** This path description relies on visualizing the provided coordinates. It's crucial to plot these points and the obstacle boundaries to confirm the path's validity and safety.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set

    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 12:05:03 PM] The feedback indicates that the chosen path collides with Obstacle 2. Looking at the longest valid subpath, a different approach can be taken by using the second breakpoint in Breakpoint Set 1: (2.0, 5.5).  This breakpoint is clear from obstacles, and from there a straight line to the goal set can be drawn without intersecting any obstacles.

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   // Starting point within the start set
    (2.0, 5.5),   // Breakpoint Set 1 - clear of obstacles 
    (4.5, 4.5)    // Endpoint within the goal set

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 12:05:14 PM] The first segment of the suggested path crosses obstacle 2. To circumvent this, the path needs to be adjusted to navigate around the obstacle. One approach is to route the path below obstacle 2. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (2.0, -2.5),   # Navigate below obstacle 2 using the breakpoint
    (4.5, -2.0),   # Move towards the goal set while staying below obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)    # Move upwards to end within the goal set 
]
```

This new path aims to avoid crossing obstacle 2 by:

1. **Starting at (0.5, 0.5):**  Beginning within the start set.
2. **Moving to (2.0, -2.5):**  Utilizing the breakpoint to navigate below obstacle 2.
3. **Progressing to (4.5, -2.0):** Moving towards the goal set while staying below obstacle 2.
4. **Reaching (4.5, 4.5):** Moving upwards to end within the goal set. 

This path attempts to address the obstacle collision while still satisfying the start/end and breakpoint requirements.

There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 12:05:21 PM] The problem lies in the second segment of the suggested path, which crosses Obstacle 1.  To correct this, we can reroute the path to go around this obstacle. Since we already have a valid subpath to the first breakpoint, we can continue from there:

1. **Valid Subpath:** The path reaches the breakpoint (2.0, -2.5) successfully.
2. **Circumventing Obstacle 1:**  We need to navigate around Obstacle 1 to proceed towards the goal.  Given the obstacle's position and shape, it's best to go around it from the right side where there's more open space. 
3. **Reaching the Goal:** Once clear of Obstacle 1, we can plot a direct course to the goal set.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   
    (2.0, -2.5),  
    (7.0, -2.5),  # Move far right, clear of Obstacle 1
    (7.0, 5.0),   # Move straight up to the level of the goal set
    (4.5, 4.5)    # Move left and reach the goal set
]
```
