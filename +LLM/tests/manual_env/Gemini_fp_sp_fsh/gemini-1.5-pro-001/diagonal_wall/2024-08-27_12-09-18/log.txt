# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 12:09:34 PM] The provided environment presents a few challenges due to the positioning of obstacles relative to the start and goal areas. Let's break down a possible path:

**Analysis:**

* **Obstacle 1** sits to the right of the start and goal, effectively blocking any direct eastward movement from the start.
* **Obstacle 2**  is more problematic, as it stretches diagonally across the space, potentially obstructing paths that try to go around Obstacle 1 from above or below. 
* **Breakpoint Set 1** offers a potential solution. (2.0, -2.5) is completely out of the way and easily accessible, while (2.0, 5.5) sits above all obstacles.

**Path:**

1. **Start:** (0.5, 0.0) - Begin in the middle of the bottom edge of the start set.
2. **Navigate Down:** (0.5, -2.5) - Move directly south to the first breakpoint, avoiding any obstacles.
3. **Move Right:** (2.0, -2.5) - Head east to the second breakpoint, still clear of any obstacles.
4. **Ascend:** (2.0, 5.5) - Travel directly north, passing above Obstacle 2 and staying clear of its diagonal edge.
5. **Approach Goal:** (4.5, 5.5) - Move east, aligning with the goal set.
6. **Enter Goal:** (4.5, 4.5) - Descend directly south into the center of the goal set. 

**Path Array:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.0), 
    (0.5, -2.5), 
    (2.0, -2.5), 
    (2.0, 5.5), 
    (4.5, 5.5),
    (4.5, 4.5)
]
```

**Note:** This is just one possible path. Other variations exist, especially when considering slightly different starting points or angles of approach. The key is to systematically analyze the obstacles and breakpoints to identify a safe and efficient route.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.

		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 12:09:48 PM] The previous path failed because it tried to cross Obstacle 2 directly. To avoid this, we can adjust the path to go around Obstacle 2.

The valid subpath leads us to the breakpoint (2.0, -2.5).  From there, we can navigate to the goal by first heading further south to avoid Obstacle 2, then going east, and finally north to the goal. 

Here is the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.0), 
    (0.5, -2.5), 
    (2.0, -2.5), 
    (2.0, -3.0),  # Move south to clear Obstacle 2
    (6.0, -3.0),  # Move east, staying clear of Obstacle 2
    (6.0, 4.5),   # Move north to the latitude of the goal
    (4.5, 4.5)    # Move west into the goal set 
]

### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 12:09:56 PM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 1. Analyzing the valid subpath, a possible solution involves navigating around Obstacle 1.

Instead of directly going upwards from (6.0, -3.0), we can guide the path around the obstacle. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.0), 
    (0.5, -2.5), 
    (2.0, -2.5), 
    (2.0, -3.0), 
    (6.0, -3.0),  
    (7.0, -3.0),  # Move right, clearing Obstacle 1
    (7.0, 4.5),   # Move upwards to the goal's y-level
    (4.5, 4.5)   # Move left to reach the goal set
]
```

This path maintains a safe distance from Obstacle 1 by going around it to the right. It then proceeds upwards, ensuring it remains clear of the obstacle before finally moving left to reach the goal set.
