# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 11:52:02 AM] The provided environment allows for a relatively straightforward path by navigating above Obstacle 1 and to the left of Obstacle 2.

Here's a possible path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (2.0, -2.5),   # Pass through Breakpoint Set 1
    (2.0, 3.0),    # Move upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)     # End within the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(0.5, 0.5):** Starts in the center of the start set.
2. **(2.0, -2.5):**  Moves to the first breakpoint, well below Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2.
3. **(2.0, 3.0):**  Moves directly upwards, staying left of Obstacle 2.
4. **(4.5, 4.5):**  Moves diagonally right to reach the center of the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 11:52:13 AM] The current path goes down too far and hits Obstacle 2. Instead, let's try to route the path above Obstacle 2 entirely. 

From the valid subpath endpoint (2.0, -2.5), we can move horizontally to the right, going above Obstacle 1. Then, we can move upwards, passing Breakpoint Set 1 at (2.0, 5.5). Finally, we can navigate to the goal set.

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (2.0, -2.5), 
    (3.5, -2.5),  # Move right, staying below Obstacle 2
    (3.5, 5.5),   # Move up, passing Breakpoint Set 1
    (4.5, 4.5)    # Move to the goal set

[08/27/2024 11:52:30 AM] The provided path goes through obstacle 2 because it attempts to cross the obstacle with a straight vertical line. We need to adjust the path to go around this obstacle.

The path correctly utilizes the first breakpoint (2.0, -2.5).  We can leverage this starting point to navigate around the obstacle. Instead of drawing a straight vertical line to the second breakpoint, we can navigate around obstacle 2 by going east and then north. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),        # Start in the start set
    (2.0, -2.5),       # First breakpoint
    (3.5, -2.5),       # Move slightly east to clear the obstacle's corner
    (3.5, -3.0),       # Move further south to clear the obstacle
    (3.5, 6.0),       # Move north, clearing the obstacle 
    (4.5, 6.0),       # Move east, towards the goal
    (4.5, 4.5)        # End in the goal set
]
```

This path first moves slightly east to avoid the sharp corner of obstacle 2, then south to a point that is further south than the southernmost point of the obstacle. From there, it moves north past the obstacle and then east towards the goal.

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 11:52:43 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 2.  The current path attempts to cross directly through the middle of the obstacle, which is not permissible.

Instead of attempting a straight vertical line from (3.5, -3.0) let's navigate around Obstacle 2. 

We can accomplish this by utilizing the second breakpoint at (2.0, 5.5):

1. **From the last valid waypoint (3.5, -2.5):** Move horizontally to the x-coordinate of the breakpoint (2.0, 5.5). This results in waypoint (2.0, -2.5).

2. **Move vertically to the breakpoint:** This takes us to (2.0, 5.5).

3. **Navigate to the goal:** From the breakpoint, we can safely move horizontally to an x-coordinate that falls within the goal region. We'll choose (4.5, 5.5). Finally, move downward to reach the goal set, for instance, at (4.5, 4.5).

Therefore, the corrected path is:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, -2.5), (2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 5.5), (4.5, 5.5), (4.5, 4.5)] 
```

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.

[08/27/2024 11:53:10 AM] The provided path goes through obstacle 2. We need to find a way around this obstacle. 

Looking at the start and end points, and the location of the obstacle, we can attempt to go around the obstacle by routing the path below it.  

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start within the start set
    (2.0, -2.5),  # Utilize the breakpoint below obstacle 2
    (6.0, -2.5),  # Move right, staying below obstacle 2
    (6.0, 4.5),  # Move upwards to the level of the goal set
    (4.5, 4.5)   # Move left to end within the goal set 
]
```

This path attempts to navigate around obstacle 2 by:

1. **Starting at (0.5, 0.5)** within the start set.
2. **Moving to the breakpoint (2.0, -2.5)** This positions the path below obstacle 2.
3. **Moving right to (6.0, -2.5)**, staying below obstacle 2.
4. **Moving up to (6.0, 4.5)** to align with the goal set. 
5. **Moving left to (4.5, 4.5)** to end within the goal set.

    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 11:53:28 AM] The problem lies in the third segment of the path going straight upwards, intersecting with Obstacle 1. To circumvent this, we can reroute the path to go around Obstacle 1.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start within the start set
    (2.0, -2.5),  # Pass through the breakpoint
    (6.0, -2.5),  # Navigate around Obstacle 1 
    (6.0, -3.0),  # Stay clear of Obstacle 1's corner
    (3.0, -3.0),  # Move towards the goal, passing below Obstacle 1
    (3.0, 4.5),   # Move upwards, clear of all obstacles
    (4.5, 4.5)    # End within the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Maintain the first two waypoints:** The initial segment of the path is valid and strategically uses the breakpoint. 
2. **Route around Obstacle 1:** Instead of directly going up, the path takes a detour around Obstacle 1 by first moving further right, then going below it.
3. **Approach the Goal:** After clearing Obstacle 1, the path moves left and upwards to reach the goal set.

This revised path avoids all obstacles while successfully starting in the start set, ending in the goal set, and passing through the chosen breakpoint.

			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, -2.5), (6.0, -2.5), (6.0, -3.0), (3.0, -3.0), (3.0, 4.5), (4.5, 4.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 11:53:43 AM] The problem arises when the path tries to move back into the area above the x-axis after going around obstacle 1. The segment from (3.0, -3.0) to (3.0, 4.5) cuts right through obstacle 2.  

Instead of trying to move back up, lets try going around obstacle 2 entirely.  Since we've already gone below it, let's continue to the right.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (2.0, -2.5), 
    (6.0, -2.5), 
    (6.0, -3.0), 
    (7.0, -3.0), # Move further right to clear Obstacle 1
    (7.0, 6.0), # Move up to clear Obstacle 2
    (5.0, 6.0), # Move left towards the goal
    (4.5, 4.5)  # Arrive at the goal 
]
