# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 11:53:53 AM] Here's a possible path considering the provided obstacles and breakpoints:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),    # Start within the start set
    (2.0, -2.5),   # Pass through Breakpoint Set 1 
    (3.0, -1.5),   # Navigate around Obstacle 1, maintaining a safe distance
    (4.5, 2.0),    # Move towards the goal set
    (5.0, 4.5)     # End within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **(0.5, 0.5):**  Starts within the start set.
2. **(2.0, -2.5):** Directly targets the first breakpoint, staying clear of any obstacles.
3. **(3.0, -1.5):**  Moves slightly right and up, carefully navigating around the bottom-left corner of Obstacle 1.
4. **(4.5, 2.0):**  Heads towards the goal set, ensuring a safe passage between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2.
5. **(5.0, 4.5):** Arrives within the goal set, successfully completing the path. 

**Important:** This is a visual interpretation and might need further refinement to guarantee absolute collision avoidance depending on the specific size and clearance requirements related to your obstacles.

		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, -2.5), (3.0, -1.5)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 11:54:06 AM] The problem arises when the path tries to go from the breakpoint (2.0, -2.5) to (3.0, -1.5) and then to (4.5, 2.0). This segment cuts through the middle of Obstacle 2. 

Instead of trying to navigate through that tight space, let's utilize the other breakpoint (2.0, 5.5). From there, we can easily reach the goal set without intersecting any obstacles. 

Here's the adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   // Start within the start set
    (2.0, 5.5),   // Move to breakpoint 1 
    (4.5, 5.5),   // Move right, staying clear of Obstacle 2 
    (4.5, 4.5)    // Move down into the goal set 
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles and successfully connects the start and goal sets by utilizing a safe passage through the available breakpoints.

* **Navigate below Obstacle 2:** We can go through the breakpoint (2.0, -2.5)
* **Approach the goal:** From the breakpoint, we can move towards the goal set. 
* **Reach the goal:** Finally, we can pick a point within the goal set (4.5, 4.5).

[08/27/2024 11:54:30 AM] The current path fails because it tries to cross obstacle 2 directly. To circumvent this, we can utilize the first breakpoint at (2.0, -2.5). From this breakpoint, we can navigate around obstacle 2 by first moving downwards, then rightwards, and finally upwards to reach the goal set. 

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),   # Start within the start set
    (2.0, -2.5),  # Pass through the first breakpoint 
    (2.0, -3.0),  # Move further down, clear of obstacle 2 
    (6.0, -3.0),  # Move right, maintaining a safe distance from obstacle 2
    (6.0, 5.0),   # Move upwards, clear of obstacle 2
    (4.5, 4.5)    # End within the goal set 
] 
```

This path avoids all obstacles while successfully navigating from the start set to the goal set through the designated breakpoint.

# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [-0.0, 1.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [1.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[-2.0, 4.0], [3.0, -1.0], [5.0, 1.0], [0.0, 6.0]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(2.0, -2.5), (2.0, 5.5)]

## Your generated path:
    path = [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, -2.5), (2.0, -3.0), (6.0, -3.0), (6.0, 5.0), (4.5, 4.5)]

## Feedback
    Start set: Correct, The path starts in the correct start set.
    End set: Correct, The path ends inside the goal set.
    First segment to cross with an Obstacle (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]:
    	Segment 4 between points (6.0, -3.0) and (6.0, 5.0) intersects with obstacle(s):
				Obstacle 1: [[6.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0], [4.0, -2.0], [6.0, -2.0]])
		Longest valid subpath from start: [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, -2.5), (2.0, -3.0), (6.0, -3.0)]
    

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/27/2024 11:54:44 AM] The issue lies in the segment connecting (6.0, -3.0) to (6.0, 5.0), which cuts through Obstacle 1. To circumvent this, we can reroute the path by leveraging the provided breakpoint (2.0, 5.5). 

Here's a possible adjustment:

1. **Utilize the Valid Subpath:** Start with the longest valid subpath: [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, -2.5), (2.0, -3.0), (6.0, -3.0)].

2. **Navigate Upwards:** From (6.0, -3.0), move vertically upwards to a point that lies above Obstacle 1, such as (6.0, 1.0).

3. **Approach Breakpoint:**  From (6.0, 1.0), move towards the breakpoint (2.0, 5.5).

4. **Reach Goal Set:** Finally, from (2.0, 5.5), navigate to a point within the goal set, like (4.5, 4.5).

Therefore, the corrected path is:

```
new_path = [(0.5, 0.5), (2.0, -2.5), (2.0, -3.0), (6.0, -3.0), (6.0, 1.0), (2.0, 5.5), (4.5, 4.5)]

[08/27/2024 11:55:01 AM] The problem is with the segment connecting (2.0, -3.0) to (6.0, -3.0) and then to (6.0, 1.0) as it collides with Obstacle 1. To circumvent this, we can adjust the path to go around Obstacle 1. 

Instead of keeping the y-coordinate constant at -3.0 and moving right, we can:

1. **Continue from the valid subpath:** Move right to a point with an x-coordinate slightly smaller than the obstacle's rightmost x-coordinate while maintaining a y-coordinate that keeps us clear of Obstacle 1.
2. **Move upwards:** Increase the y-coordinate to a value greater than the obstacle's maximum y-coordinate, ensuring we go around it without crossing.
3. **Continue towards the goal:** Move right and upwards as needed to reach the breakpoint (2.0, 5.5). From there, we can proceed to the goal set.

Here's a possible adjusted path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), 
    (2.0, -2.5), 
    (2.0, -3.0),
    (3.9, -3.0),  # Move right but stay clear of Obstacle 1

]

[08/27/2024 11:55:17 AM] The path needs to be adjusted to avoid colliding with Obstacle 1. We can achieve this by navigating around the obstacle. 

Starting from the last valid point (3.9, -1.5), we can direct the path downwards to (3.9, -2.5) to go around Obstacle 1. Then, continue moving right to (7.0, -2.5) to clear the obstacle completely. From there, we can safely move upwards to (7.0, 1.0), and then proceed to the breakpoint (2.0, 5.5) to satisfy the breakpoint requirement. Finally, the path can reach the goal set at (4.5, 4.5).

Here's the adjusted path:
