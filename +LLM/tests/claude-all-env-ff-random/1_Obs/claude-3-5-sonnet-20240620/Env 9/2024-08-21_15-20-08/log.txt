# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[4.5, 7.9], [8.3, 1.4], [10.9, 8.2], [6.8, 13.7]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 0.62), (9.0, 16.37)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
new_path = [
    [0.5, 0.5], # start in the start set
    [0.0, 5.25], # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate

[08/21/2024 03:20:10 PM] Here is a possible path that satisfies the given requirements:

[08/21/2024 03:20:13 PM] Here's my thought process and the changes I made to the path:

The provided path intersects with Obstacle 1 in the second segment between the points (2.0, 10.0) and (14.0, 10.0). To avoid this obstacle, I will need to adjust the path.

First, I'll examine the start and end points of the path to ensure they are within the start and goal sets, respectively. The start point (1.0, 2.0) is within the start set, and the end point (19.0, 19.0) is within the goal set, so those are correct.

Next, I'll look at the breakpoints. The provided path does not pass through any of the breakpoints in Breakpoint Set 1 [(9.0, 0.62), (9.0, 16.37)]. I'll need to adjust the path to ensure it passes through at least one of these breakpoints.

To avoid the obstacle and pass through a breakpoint, I'll modify the path as follows:
1. Start at a point within the start set, e.g., (1.0, 2.0).
2. Move diagonally up and to the right, passing through the first breakpoint at (9.0, 16.37).
3. Continue moving horizontally to the right, passing through the second breakpoint at (9.0, 0.62).
4. Finally, move diagonally up and to the right to reach a point within the goal set.

The new path would be:
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0),
    (5.0, 16.0),
    (9.0, 0.62),
    (19.0, 19.0)
]

This path starts within the start set, passes through both breakpoints in Breakpoint Set 1, and avoids intersecting with Obstacle 1. It also ends within the goal set.

[08/21/2024 03:20:17 PM] To solve this motion planning task, I will analyze the provided data and adjust the path to avoid intersecting with the obstacles while ensuring the path starts within the start set, ends in the goal set, and passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.

Chain of Thought:
1. The initial path provided is: [(1.0, 2.0), (5.0, 16.0), (9.0, 0.62), (19.0, 19.0)].
2. The feedback indicates that the second segment of the path, between the points (5.0, 16.0) and (9.0, 0.62), intersects with Obstacle 1.
3. The longest valid subpath from the start is [(1.0, 2.0), (5.0, 16.0)].

Obstacle Avoidance:
1. The key is to find a path that avoids the obstacle while still passing through one of the breakpoints.
2. The breakpoints are (9.0, 0.62) and (9.0, 16.37). Since the second segment of the initial path intersects the obstacle, I will try to avoid this by passing through the other breakpoint at (9.0, 16.37).
3. I will adjust the path to go from the start set to the first breakpoint at (9.0, 16.37), then continue to the goal set.

Path Adjustments:
new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0), # Start in the start set
    (5.0, 16.0),
    (9.0, 16.37), # Pass through the second breakpoint
    (19.0, 19.0) # End in the goal set
]

Verification:
1. The new path starts within the start set, ends in the goal set, and passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
2. The path segments do not intersect with the obstacle.

Therefore, the new path [(1.0, 2.0), (5.0, 16.0), (9.0, 16.37), (19.0, 19.0)] is a valid solution to the motion planning task.
