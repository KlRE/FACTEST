# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[2.0, 2.0], [-0.0, 2.0], [-0.0, -0.0], [2.0, -0.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[20.0, 20.0], [18.0, 20.0], [18.0, 18.0], [20.0, 18.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[10.6, 17.4], [0.6, 19.3], [1.5, 17.5], [7.1, 15.9]]

    Breakpoints:
		Breakpoint Set 1: [(9.0, 7.36), (9.0, 19.85)]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints, where you are allowed to use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Breakpoints: Choose one waypoint from each set of breakpoints. The path should pass through one of the breakpoints of each set.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
new_path = [
    [0.5, 0.5], # start in the start set
    [0.0, 5.25], # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    [3.75, 5.25], # move rightwards to reach the gap
    [4.5, 4.5] # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/21/2024 03:18:53 PM] Here is a possible path that meets the requirements:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0),    # Start within the start set
    (9.0, 19.85),  # Pass through the first breakpoint
    (10.0, 18.0),
    (15.0, 18.0),
    (18.0, 20.0)   # End within the goal set
]

This path starts within the start set, passes through one of the breakpoints in the first breakpoint set, and avoids the obstacle by going around it. The path ends within the goal set. None of the linearly connected segments cross any obstacles.

## Instructions for Correction
    No code: Do not include any code in your response.
    Chain of Thought: Explain your thought process and the changes you made to the path. Analyze the spatial relationships between the obstacles and work out segments that are valid and invalid.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Adjust the path to avoid intersecting obstacles. You may add waypoints at problematic waypoints to move around obstacles.
		Path Adjustments: Try to either continue from the valid subpath or suggest a new path in case the current path ends in a dead end.
    Breakpoints: Ensure the path passes through one of the breakpoints of each set. Not all of them lead to a valid path, so you may need to adjust the path accordingly.

[08/21/2024 03:18:57 PM] To solve this motion planning task, let's analyze the provided data and work on adjusting the given path to avoid the obstacles.

Chain of Thought:
1. The initial path provided, [(1.0, 2.0), (9.0, 19.85), (10.0, 18.0), (15.0, 18.0), (18.0, 20.0)], starts correctly within the start set, but the first segment between (1.0, 2.0) and (9.0, 19.85) intersects with Obstacle 1.
2. The longest valid subpath from the start is [(1.0, 2.0)], as the subsequent segments cross the obstacle.
3. To avoid the obstacle, we need to adjust the path by adding additional waypoints to navigate around it.

Obstacle Avoidance:
1. The first segment, (1.0, 2.0) to (9.0, 19.85), intersects with Obstacle 1. We can adjust this segment by adding a waypoint at one of the breakpoints, (9.0, 7.36), which is the first breakpoint set.
2. From (1.0, 2.0), we can move to (9.0, 7.36) to avoid the obstacle, and then continue towards the goal set.
3. From (9.0, 7.36), we can move to (18.0, 20.0) to reach the goal set.

Breakpoints:
1. The adjusted path passes through one of the breakpoints, (9.0, 7.36), which satisfies the requirement.

Path Adjustments:
The new path that avoids the obstacle and passes through a breakpoint is:

new_path = [
    (1.0, 2.0),
    (9.0, 7.36),
    (18.0, 20.0)
]

This path starts within the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids the obstacle by navigating around it through the breakpoint.
