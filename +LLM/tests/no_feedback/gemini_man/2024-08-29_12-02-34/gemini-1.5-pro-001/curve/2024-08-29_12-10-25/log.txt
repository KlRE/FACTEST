# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[-3.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 7.0], [-4.0, 6.0], [-3.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[6.0, 7.0], [5.0, 7.0], [5.0, 6.0], [6.0, 6.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[-2.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 3.0], [-4.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.0, 1.0], [-2.0, 1.0], [-2.0, -1.0], [0.0, -1.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[-1.0, 6.0], [1.0, 4.0], [3.0, 6.0], [1.0, 8.0]]
			Obstacle 4: [[4.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [2.0, -1.0], [4.0, -1.0]]
			Obstacle 5: [[6.0, 3.0], [4.0, 3.0], [4.0, 1.0], [6.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 6: [[-2.0, 10.0], [-4.0, 10.0], [-4.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 8.0]]
			Obstacle 7: [[0.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 8.0], [-2.0, 6.0], [0.0, 6.0]]
			Obstacle 8: [[-1.0, 0.0], [1.0, -2.0], [3.0, 0.0], [1.0, 2.0]]
			Obstacle 9: [[4.0, 8.0], [2.0, 8.0], [2.0, 6.0], [4.0, 6.0]]
			Obstacle 10: [[6.0, 10.0], [4.0, 10.0], [4.0, 8.0], [6.0, 8.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/29/2024 12:10:47 PM] The provided environment has a bottleneck around [-1, 6] to [1, 8], formed by Obstacle 3, Obstacle 6, and Obstacle 7. The path needs to navigate this bottleneck to reach the goal.

Here's a possible path:

```
new_path = [
    (-3.5, 6.5),    # Start within the start set
    (-3.5, 9.0),    # Move upwards to avoid Obstacle 6 and Obstacle 7
    (0.0,  9.0),    # Move rightwards, staying clear of Obstacle 6 and Obstacle 10
    (0.0,  7.5),    # Move downwards to navigate the bottleneck between Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 7
    (2.5,  7.5),    # Move rightwards, staying clear of Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 9
    (5.5,  6.5)     # Move to a point within the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Start:** The path begins at (-3.5, 6.5), which lies within the start set.
2.  **Upward Movement:** It first moves upwards to ( -3.5, 9.0) to avoid Obstacles 6 and 7.
3.  **Rightward Movement:** Then, it moves rightwards to (0.0, 9.0), staying clear of Obstacle 6 and Obstacle 10.
4.  **Navigating the Bottleneck:** The path then carefully moves downwards to (0.0, 7.5), passing through the bottleneck created by Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 7.
5.  **Continuing Rightward:**  After clearing the bottleneck, it continues moving rightwards to (2.5, 7.5), avoiding Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 9.
6.  **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, the path reaches (5.5, 6.5), a point safely within the goal set.

This path successfully navigates the obstacles and reaches the goal set from the start set.
