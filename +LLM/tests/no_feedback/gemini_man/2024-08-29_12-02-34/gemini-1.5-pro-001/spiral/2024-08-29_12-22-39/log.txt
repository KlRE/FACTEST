# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.75, 0.75], [0.25, 0.75], [0.25, 0.25], [0.75, 0.25]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.0, 0.0], [-2.0, 0.0], [-2.0, -2.0], [15.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.0, 15.0], [-2.0, 15.0], [-2.0, -0.0], [0.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[4.0, 14.0], [1.0, 14.0], [1.0, 1.0], [4.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 4: [[14.0, 4.0], [4.0, 4.0], [4.0, 1.0], [14.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 5: [[14.0, 10.0], [5.0, 10.0], [5.0, 4.0], [14.0, 4.0]]
			Obstacle 6: [[14.0, 14.0], [4.0, 14.0], [4.0, 11.0], [14.0, 11.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/29/2024 12:22:50 PM] Here is a possible path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5,  0.5),   # Start at the center of the start set
    (0.5,  3.5),   # Move upward, staying clear of Obstacles 2 and 3
    (3.5,  3.5),   # Move rightward, maintaining a safe distance from Obstacle 3
    (3.5,  5.5),   # Move upward, avoiding Obstacle 5 
    (4.5,  5.5),   # Move rightward, entering the goal set
    (4.5,  4.5)    # Arrive at the center of the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

* The path begins by navigating upwards to avoid the large horizontal obstacles (1 & 2) completely. 
* It then proceeds rightward, staying clear of Obstacles 3 and 5.  
* This strategy prioritizes a clear and direct route by moving to open space before approaching the goal.

**Important Note:** I have manually designed this path based on spatial reasoning. It's crucial to visualize the start/goal sets and obstacles to verify the path's validity.

[08/29/2024 12:23:05 PM] Here is a possible path considering the provided obstacles and start/goal regions:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5,  0.5),   # Start within the start set
    (0.5,  3.5),   # Move upwards to avoid the lower obstacles 
    (3.5,  3.5),   # Move right, staying clear of obstacle 3 
    (3.5,  10.5),  # Move upwards, navigating between obstacles 5 and 6
    (5.5,  10.5),  # Move right, clearing obstacle 6
    (5.5,  4.5)    # Move down into the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Starting Point:** We begin at (0.5, 0.5) which is comfortably within the start set.
2. **Upward Movement:**  The path first moves upwards to (0.5, 3.5) to avoid obstacles 1 and 2 which extend far to the left.
3. **Rightward Shift:** Next, it moves right to (3.5, 3.5), carefully staying to the left of obstacle 3. 
4. **Navigating Upwards:** The path then maneuvers upwards to (3.5, 10.5), strategically passing between the gap created by obstacles 5 and 6. 
5. **Final Approach:** It then moves right to (5.5, 10.5) to clear obstacle 6 completely.
6. **Reaching the Goal:** Finally, the path descends straight down to (5.5, 4.5), landing safely within the goal set. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible solution. There might be other equally valid paths depending on the desired level of optimization (shortest distance, clearance from obstacles, etc.).

[08/29/2024 12:23:24 PM] It seems like the obstacles create a sort of channel, narrowing towards the goal. Let's try navigating that.

**Path Idea:**

1. **Start:** Begin near the top-right corner of the start set to aim towards the channel opening.
2. **Channel Entry:**  Head right, aiming for the space between Obstacles 3 and 4.
3. **Channel Following:** Continue right, staying within the channel created by the obstacles.
4. **Goal Approach:** Once past Obstacle 5, angle slightly down towards the center of the goal set.

**Path Array:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.7, 0.7),   
    (3.5, 2.0),  
    (8.0, 2.5),   
    (10.0, 2.75), 
    (12.0, 3.0), 
    (13.0, 3.25),  
    (13.5, 3.75),
    (4.5, 4.5) 
]
```

**Important Note:** This path is a visual estimation based on the provided coordinates. It hasn't been mathematically verified for collisions. You should always double-check any proposed path rigorously to ensure it meets all safety and clearance requirements.
