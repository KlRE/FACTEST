# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.75, 0.75], [0.25, 0.75], [0.25, 0.25], [0.75, 0.25]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[15.0, 0.0], [-2.0, 0.0], [-2.0, -2.0], [15.0, -2.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[0.0, 15.0], [-2.0, 15.0], [-2.0, -0.0], [0.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[4.0, 14.0], [1.0, 14.0], [1.0, 1.0], [4.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 4: [[14.0, 4.0], [4.0, 4.0], [4.0, 1.0], [14.0, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 5: [[14.0, 10.0], [5.0, 10.0], [5.0, 4.0], [14.0, 4.0]]
			Obstacle 6: [[14.0, 14.0], [4.0, 14.0], [4.0, 11.0], [14.0, 11.0]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/29/2024 12:21:11 PM] The provided environment features a channel-like path leading upwards, with the start position near the bottom and the goal position near the top. Obstacles are primarily located to the left and right, leaving the vertical path relatively clear. 

Here's a possible path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5,  0.5),   # Start in the center of the start set
    (0.5,  3.0),   # Move upwards, staying clear of Obstacle 3 
    (2.0,  3.0),   # Move right, towards the center, avoiding Obstacle 3
    (2.0,  13.0),  # Move upwards, staying clear of Obstacles 3 and 6
    (4.5,  13.0),  # Move right, towards the goal, avoiding Obstacle 6
    (4.5,  4.5)    # Move down into the center of the goal set 
]
```

This path avoids all obstacles by maintaining a safe distance and navigating through the open "channel" towards the goal.

[08/29/2024 12:21:39 PM] It seems like the obstacles create a sort of channel, narrowing as we move towards the goal.  Let's try this path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5,  0.5),   # Start in the center of the start set
    (0.5,  3.5),   # Move upwards, staying clear of obstacles 2 and 3
    (3.5,  3.5),   # Move right, staying within the channel
    (3.5,  4.5),   # Move down towards the center of the goal set
    (4.5,  4.5)    # End in the center of the goal set 
]
```

This path aims to:

1. **Start Safely:** Begins in the middle of the start set.
2. **Navigate the Channel:**  Moves up and then right, staying within the open space between obstacle groups (2,3) and (4,5,6).
3. **Reach the Goal:**  Once aligned with the goal, it moves directly into the goal set. 

It's important to visualize this based on the provided coordinates to double-check for collisions.

[08/29/2024 12:21:50 PM] The provided environment has a channel leading from the start to the goal, with obstacles flanking the sides. A straight line path is possible.

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start at center of start zone
    (4.5, 4.5)   # Move straight to center of goal zone
]
