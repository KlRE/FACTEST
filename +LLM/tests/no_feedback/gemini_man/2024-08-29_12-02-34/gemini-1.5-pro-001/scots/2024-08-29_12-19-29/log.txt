# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.7, 0.7], [0.3, 0.7], [0.3, 0.3], [0.7, 0.3]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[9.7, 0.8], [9.3, 0.8], [9.3, 0.4], [9.7, 0.4]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[1.2, 9.0], [1.0, 9.0], [1.0, -0.0], [1.2, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 2: [[2.4, 5.0], [2.2, 5.0], [2.2, -0.0], [2.4, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 3: [[2.4, 10.0], [2.2, 10.0], [2.2, 6.0], [2.4, 6.0]]
			Obstacle 4: [[3.6, 9.0], [3.4, 9.0], [3.4, -0.0], [3.6, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 5: [[4.8, 10.0], [4.6, 10.0], [4.6, 1.0], [4.8, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 6: [[6.0, 6.0], [5.8, 6.0], [5.8, -0.0], [6.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 7: [[6.0, 10.0], [5.8, 10.0], [5.8, 7.0], [6.0, 7.0]]
			Obstacle 8: [[7.2, 10.0], [7.0, 10.0], [7.0, 1.0], [7.2, 1.0]]
			Obstacle 9: [[8.4, 8.5], [8.2, 8.5], [8.2, -0.0], [8.4, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 10: [[9.3, 8.5], [8.4, 8.5], [8.4, 8.3], [9.3, 8.3]]
			Obstacle 11: [[10.0, 7.3], [9.3, 7.3], [9.3, 7.1], [10.0, 7.1]]
			Obstacle 12: [[9.3, 6.1], [8.4, 6.1], [8.4, 5.9], [9.3, 5.9]]
			Obstacle 13: [[10.0, 4.9], [9.3, 4.9], [9.3, 4.7], [10.0, 4.7]]
			Obstacle 14: [[9.3, 3.7], [8.4, 3.7], [8.4, 3.5], [9.3, 3.5]]
			Obstacle 15: [[10.0, 2.5], [9.3, 2.5], [9.3, 2.3], [10.0, 2.3]]

    
## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/29/2024 12:19:43 PM] The path can be planned by navigating above the obstacles clustered at the bottom of the environment and going through the openings between Obstacles 5 and 8, Obstacles 8 and 10, and Obstacles 10 and 11. 

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 1.5),  # Move upward, clearing the obstacle cluster 
    (4.7, 1.5),  # Move rightward, navigating between Obstacles 5 and 8
    (7.1, 1.5),  # Continue rightward, passing between Obstacles 8 and 10
    (8.3, 8.4),  # Move upward and rightward, passing between Obstacles 10 and 11 
    (9.5, 0.6)   # Move downward to end within the goal set
