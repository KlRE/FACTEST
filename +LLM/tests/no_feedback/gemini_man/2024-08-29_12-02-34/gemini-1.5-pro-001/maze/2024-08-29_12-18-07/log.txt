# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.6, 3.6], [0.4, 3.6], [0.4, 3.4], [0.6, 3.4]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
    Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[6.75, 5.0], [6.25, 5.0], [6.25, 4.5], [6.75, 4.5]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
    Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
			Obstacle 1: [[3.0, 1.0], [1.0, 1.0], [1.0, 0.9], [3.0, 0.9]]

			Obstacle 9: [[6.0, 1.0], [4.0, 1.0], [4.0, 0.9], [6.0, 0.9]]
			Obstacle 10: [[5.0, 4.0], [4.9, 4.0], [4.9, 2.0], [5.0, 2.0]]
			Obstacle 11: [[6.0, 2.0], [5.0, 2.0], [5.0, 1.9], [6.0, 1.9]]
			Obstacle 12: [[6.0, 5.0], [5.9, 5.0], [5.9, 2.0], [6.0, 2.0]]
			Obstacle 13: [[5.0, 1.0], [4.9, 1.0], [4.9, -0.0], [5.0, -0.0]]
			Obstacle 14: [[7.0, 0.1], [-0.0, 0.1], [-0.0, -0.0], [7.0, -0.0]]

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.
Goal Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[5.0, 5.0], [4.0, 5.0], [4.0, 4.0], [5.0, 4.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/29/2024 12:18:20 PM] The path can be planned by navigating above the obstacles clustered around y-values of 2 and 3. Here's a possible path:

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),    # Start within the start set
    (0.5, 4.25),   # Move upwards to avoid obstacles 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8
    (2.5, 4.25),   # Move rightwards, staying above obstacles 6 and 7
    (4.0, 4.25),   # Continue rightwards above obstacle 10
    (6.5, 4.25),   # Move rightwards above obstacle 12
    (6.5, 4.75)    # Move downwards to end within the goal set 
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Starting Point:** We begin at (0.5, 3.5), safely within the start set.
2. **Upward Movement:** We move upwards to y = 4.25 to clear the cluster of obstacles below.
3. **Rightward Progression:** We maintain y = 4.25 and carefully move rightwards, staying above obstacles 6, 7, and 10. 
4. **Approaching the Goal:** Continuing rightwards, we bypass obstacle 12.
5. **Final Descent:**  Finally, we descend slightly to (6.5, 4.75), which lies comfortably within the goal set.

This path ensures a safe distance from all obstacles, adhering to the non-crossing requirement.
