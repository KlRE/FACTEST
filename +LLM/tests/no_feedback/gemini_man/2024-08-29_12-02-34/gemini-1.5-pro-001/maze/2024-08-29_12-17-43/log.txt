# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.6, 3.6], [0.4, 3.6], [0.4, 3.4], [0.6, 3.4]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [
        (waypoint_x1, waypoint_y1),    
        ...,
        (waypoint_xn, waypoint_yn)       
    ]
    
## Example
### Provided Data
Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]
    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

    Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to end the path.
Obstacles (Quadrilaterals): Each obstacle is defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]:
    Obstacle 1: [[3.5, 5.0], [3.0, 5.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.5, 0.0]]
    Obstacle 2: [[7.0, 6.0], [3.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.5], [7.0, 5.5]]
    Obstacle 3: [[7.0, 0.0], [3.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0], [7.0, -1.0]]
### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/29/2024 12:17:56 PM] The provided environment presents a challenging but solvable pathfinding problem. Here's a manually determined path:

**Analysis:**

* **Vertical Start:**  The start set sits between obstacles, necessitating an immediate upward or downward path.
* **Obstacle Maze:** Obstacles 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 create a complex maze-like structure in the center.
* **Eastern Corridor:** A somewhat clear vertical corridor exists to the right of obstacles 8, 10, and 12.
* **Goal Approach:**  The goal set is relatively open, allowing approach from the east.

**Path:**

```python
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),   # Start within the start set 
    (0.5, 4.25),  # Move upwards to avoid Obstacle 2 
    (2.75, 4.25), # Move right, staying above Obstacles 3, 4, 5
    (2.75, 2.75), # Move downward, navigating between Obstacle clusters 
    (3.5, 2.75),  # Carefully move right, staying clear of Obstacle 7
    (3.5, 1.5),   # Move downward, preparing to navigate below Obstacles 6 and 9 
    (5.5, 1.5),   # Move right, passing below Obstacles 6 and 9
    (5.5, 4.75),  # Move upward, entering the corridor east of Obstacle 12
    (6.5, 4.75)   # Move right to reach the goal set
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. The path starts by moving upwards to avoid the immediate obstacle (Obstacle 2).
2. It then carefully maneuvers rightward, staying clear of the obstacle clusters. 
3. By strategically moving downward and then right again, it avoids Obstacles 6 and 9.
4. Finally, the path moves upward, enters the corridor, and reaches the goal set.

**Important:**  This manually planned path is a visual estimation.  It's crucial to verify its validity by plotting it against the obstacle coordinates to ensure no collisions occur.
