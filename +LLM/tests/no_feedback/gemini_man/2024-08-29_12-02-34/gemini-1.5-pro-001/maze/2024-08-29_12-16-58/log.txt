# Motion Planning Task
## Goal: Come up with a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Quadrilateral): Defined by the clockwise coordinates of its four vertices [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]] = [[0.6, 3.6], [0.4, 3.6], [0.4, 3.4], [0.6, 3.4]]
        Note: You can choose any point within this Quadrilateral to start the path.

## Instructions
    Path Array: Output the path as an array of waypoints.
    Start and End: The path must begin at any point within the start set and end at any point within the goal set.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Verify that the path does not intersect any obstacles.
    No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.
    
## Path Format:
    Provide the new path as an array of waypoints in the following format:
    new_path = [

### Example Response
There is a horizontal gap between obstacles 1 and 2. The path can be planned to move through this gap.
{...Further Analysis of the Environment and its spatial relationships}

new_path = [
    (0.5, 0.5), # start in the start set
    (0.0, 5.25), # move upwards to get on the level as the gap and avoid touching Obstacle 1 by adding 0.25 to the y-coordinate
    (3.75, 5.25), # move rightwards to reach the gap
    (4.5, 4.5) # move downwards to end in the goal set
]

[08/29/2024 12:17:16 PM] The provided environment presents a challenging but solvable path planning scenario. Here's a manually designed path:

**Analysis:**

1. **Initial Squeeze:**  The starting area is a narrow vertical passage between obstacles. The path needs to navigate out of this passage without touching the boundaries.

2. **Central Corridor:** After the initial squeeze, there's a relatively open vertical corridor leading upwards. This corridor is partially blocked by obstacles, requiring careful maneuvering.

3. **Obstacles near Goal:** The approach to the goal area is obstructed by obstacles, necessitating a strategic path around them.

**Proposed Path:**

```
new_path = [
    (0.5, 3.5),   # Start within the start set.
    (0.5, 3.9),   # Move up slightly to avoid the corner of obstacle 2.
    (2.5, 3.9),   # Move right, staying close to obstacle 2 to avoid obstacle 8.
    (2.5, 4.25),  # Move up further, creating distance from obstacle 8.
    (4.8, 4.25),  # Move right, carefully navigating between obstacles 2 and 10.
    (4.8, 4.75),  # Move up slightly to enter the goal set.
    (6.5, 4.75)   # Move right to a central point within the goal set. 
]
```

**Explanation:**

* The path starts by moving upwards to escape the initial confined area.
* It then proceeds rightward, maintaining a close distance to Obstacle 2 to avoid colliding with Obstacle 8.
* The path strategically positions itself vertically to navigate between Obstacles 2 and 10.
* Finally, it enters the goal set and reaches a central point.

**Important Note:** This manually designed path assumes ideal conditions and precise movements. In a real-world scenario, a robotic system would need a more robust path planning algorithm to account for uncertainties and potential errors.
