# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.3, 0.7, 0.3, 0.7)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (9.3, 9.7, 0.4, 0.8)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (1.0, 1.2, 0.0, 9.0)
			Obstacle 2: (2.2, 2.4, 0.0, 5.0)
			Obstacle 3: (2.2, 2.4, 6.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 4: (3.4, 3.6, 0.0, 9.0)
			Obstacle 5: (4.6, 4.8, 1.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 6: (5.8, 6.0, 0.0, 6.0)
			Obstacle 7: (5.8, 6.0, 7.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 8: (7.0, 7.2, 1.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 9: (8.2, 8.4, 0.0, 8.5)
			Obstacle 10: (8.4, 9.3, 8.3, 8.5)
			Obstacle 11: (9.3, 10.0, 7.1, 7.3)
			Obstacle 12: (8.4, 9.3, 5.9, 6.1)
			Obstacle 13: (9.3, 10.0, 4.7, 4.9)
			Obstacle 14: (8.4, 9.3, 3.5, 3.7)
			Obstacle 15: (9.3, 10.0, 2.3, 2.5)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:34:49 PM] ## Step 1: Analyze the Start Set
The start set is a rectangular area with coordinates (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.3, 0.7, 0.3, 0.7). This means that any point within this rectangle can be chosen as the starting point of the path.

## Step 2: Analyze the Goal Set
The goal set is a rectangular area with coordinates (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (9.3, 9.7, 0.4, 0.8). This means that any point within this rectangle can be chosen as the ending point of the path.

## Step 3: Analyze the Obstacles
There are 15 obstacles in the environment, each represented as a rectangular set with coordinates (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax). We need to check if there is a clear path between the start set and the goal set without crossing any obstacles.

## Step 4: Check for Clear Path
By examining the coordinates of the obstacles, we can see that there are several obstacles that are close to the start set and the goal set. However, there is a narrow gap between obstacles 1 and 4, and between obstacles 8 and 9, that could potentially allow a path to pass through.

## Step 5: Check for Connectivity
After re-examining the obstacles, we can see that there is a possible path that starts in the start set, passes through the gap between obstacles 1 and 4, then passes through the gap between obstacles 8 and 9, and finally ends in the goal set.

## Step 6: Conclusion
Based on the analysis, we can conclude that there is a possible path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

The final answer is:

- Chain of Reasoning: There is a narrow gap between obstacles 1 and 4, and between obstacles 8 and 9, that allows a path to pass through, connecting the start set to the goal set.
- Solvable: True
