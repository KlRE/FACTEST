# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-2.0, 7.0, 1.0, 3.0)
			Obstacle 2: (-2.0, 7.0, -2.0, 0.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

### Chain of Reasoning
To determine if the given environment is solvable, we start by analyzing the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles. 

Observing the start position (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0) and the goal position (4.0, 5.0, 0.0, 1.0), it's clear that the goal set is positioned to the right of the start set, with both sets having the same vertical span (ymin = 0.0, ymax = 1.0). This indicates that any path connecting the start and goal sets must traverse horizontally from left to right.

Next, we examine the obstacles. Obstacle 1 spans from (-2.0, 7.0, 1.0, 3.0), and Obstacle 2 spans from (-2.0, 7.0, -2.0, 0.0). Notably, both obstacles extend vertically beyond the y-range of the start and goal sets (which is 0.0 to 1.0), but neither obstacle directly blocks the horizontal path between the start and goal sets at their shared y-range.

However, considering the requirement that the path must avoid obstacles and maintain a distance from them, we notice that the horizontal path between the start and goal sets does not intersect with either obstacle. Since the obstacles do not block the path at the y-range of interest (0.0 to 1.0) and given the start and goal sets' positions, it is possible to construct a path that starts within the start set, ends within the goal set, and avoids crossing any obstacles.

### Solvable
True

This solution is based on a qualitative analysis of the spatial arrangement of the start set, goal set, and obstacles, without requiring explicit path construction or algorithmic computation.
