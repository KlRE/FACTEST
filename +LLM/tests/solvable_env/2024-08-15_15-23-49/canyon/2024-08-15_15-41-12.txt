# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-2.0, 7.0, 1.0, 3.0)
			Obstacle 2: (-2.0, 7.0, -2.0, 0.0)
			Obstacle 3: (-2.0, -1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
			Obstacle 4: (2.0, 3.0, 0.0, 1.0)
			Obstacle 5: (6.0, 7.0, 0.0, 1.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

- Chain of Reasoning:
To analyze this motion planning task, first examine the arrangement and nature of obstacles provided relative to both the start set (defined between the rectangular set \(xmin=0.0, xmax=1.0, ymin=0.0, ymax=1.0\)) and the goal set (\(xmin=4.0, xmax=5.0, ymin=0.0, ymax=1.0\)).
At the heart of spatial reasoning in motion planning is understanding the geometric relationships and connectivities of free spaces versus the constraints posed by obstacles.

Obstacles 1 and 2 impose constraints on the vertical direction, with both extending from y=-2 to 3 and covering the entirety of the workspace horizontally (-2 to 7), except they do not encroach upon the vertically shared plane where start and goal reside ([0.0, 1.0] in both x and y dimensions). These obstacles essentially section off the workspace vertically.

Meanwhile, Obstacles 3, 4, and 5 restrict portions in the y-range [0.0, 1.0], directly within the target zone of our operation. However, Obstacle 3 only exists to the left of the start position and ends just where we begin (coordinate-wise). Therefore, it doesnâ€™t block our departure but indicates we should head in a positive direction on X. Obstacles 4 and 5 directly obstruct our way to the goal.

However, Obstacle 4, though having y bounds which match our target y area (0.0, 1.0), has it bounded left by x value of 2, thereby forming an incomplete barrier leaving the segment (1.0, 2.0) unblocking access to x=4 where the goal will be reached, albeit directly. Furthermore, the way to Obstacle 5 lies still accessible.

In the interest of finding a path, one notes there is a gap within our operation range due to Obstacle 4, existing only left-wise until x=3 and after x=3 till Obstacle 5, that means moving only directly from our start set towards the right then upwards followed by towards right again does bypass obstacles as these form blockages based mainly on defined zones without forming obstruction directly through our moving segment choice avoiding forbidden areas as set by motion parameter for its intended purpose.

Considering all these constraints, a route from the start to the goal without crossing obstacles appears viable by passing eastward (at least slightly upwards then across in such straight shots way) to evade barriers formed of these vertical and horizontal (or rather at less length a shorter straight stretch where gaps manifest by moving between same-level blockages out of given boundary bars laid out).
