# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (2.0, 4.0, 0.0, 1.0)
			Obstacle 2: (-2.0, 3.0, 2.0, 4.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:32:53 PM] ## Chain of Reasoning
Analyzing the provided data, we first visualize the environment. The start set is a rectangle with the bottom-left corner at (0.0, 0.0) and the top-right corner at (1.0, 1.0). The goal set is a rectangle with the bottom-left corner at (4.0, 4.0) and the top-right corner at (5.0, 5.0). Obstacle 1 is a rectangle with the bottom-left corner at (2.0, 0.0) and the top-right corner at (4.0, 1.0), and Obstacle 2 is a rectangle with the bottom-left corner at (-2.0, 2.0) and the top-right corner at (3.0, 4.0).

Considering the locations and dimensions of these obstacles relative to the start and goal sets, we notice that Obstacle 1 creates a barrier between the start set and the goal set along the x-axis direction, as it spans from x=2.0 to x=4.0, which covers part of the path one might intuitively choose to connect the start and goal sets directly. However, there is still space above Obstacle 1 (in the y-direction) that could potentially be used to circumvent it.

Moreover, Obstacle 2, while closer to the start set, does not block the path in the y-direction completely since its top edge is at y=4.0, which is below the goal set's bottom edge at y=4.0. This suggests there might be a way to navigate around Obstacle 2 by moving upwards and then across to the goal set.

Given these observations, a path that starts within the start set, moves upwards to avoid Obstacle 1, then moves across to the right (eastwards) above Obstacle 1, and finally moves downwards to enter the goal set, seems plausible. This path avoids crossing any obstacles by keeping a safe distance from them, especially considering the constraints of not crossing and maintaining a distance.
