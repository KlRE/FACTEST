# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (2.0, 4.0, 0.0, 1.0)
			Obstacle 2: (-2.0, 3.0, 2.0, 4.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:32:12 PM] **Chain of Reasoning**
Analyzing the environment, we notice that the start set is a rectangular area located at the bottom-left corner, with coordinates (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0). The goal set is also a rectangular area, but it's located at the top-right corner, with coordinates (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0). Obstacle 1 is a rectangular area that covers the middle section of the environment, with coordinates (2.0, 4.0, 0.0, 1.0), effectively creating a "corridor" that splits the environment into two sections.

Notice that the top-right section, which includes the goal set, is isolated from the start set by Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2 does not directly influence this connection since its' presence lies beyond this analysis (Upper region where x-value beyond ~2 is influenced only).

Thus we cannot build any arbitrary continuous or not crossing obstacle segments linear path. Furthermore our proposed rectangular arbitrary solution violates rules hence "in fact **We dont Need explicit one ( the constructed by set start from X Way point = connected, however those any part doesn"t conflict & blocked route.

[08/15/2024 03:32:17 PM] ## Chain of Reasoning
The environment consists of a start set, a goal set, and two obstacles. The start set is located at (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0), the goal set is located at (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0), and the obstacles are located at (2.0, 4.0, 0.0, 1.0) and (-2.0, 3.0, 2.0, 4.0). 

Upon analyzing the environment, it is clear that the start set and the goal set are not directly connected by a straight line without intersecting an obstacle. However, there is a possible path that can be constructed by moving around the obstacles.

One possible path is to start at the top-right corner of the start set (1.0, 1.0), move upwards to (1.0, 4.0), then move rightwards to (4.0, 4.0), and finally move downwards to the bottom-right corner of the goal set (4.0, 5.0). This path avoids both obstacles and stays within the bounds of the environment.
