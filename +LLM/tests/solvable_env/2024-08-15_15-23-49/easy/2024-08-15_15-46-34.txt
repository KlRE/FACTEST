# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (2.0, 4.0, 0.0, 1.0)
			Obstacle 2: (-2.0, 3.0, 2.0, 4.0)
			Obstacle 3: (1.0, 2.0, -2.0, 2.0)
			Obstacle 4: (-2.1, -2.0, -2.0, 7.0)
			Obstacle 5: (5.0, 5.1, -2.0, 7.0)
			Obstacle 6: (-2.0, 5.0, -2.1, -2.0)
			Obstacle 7: (-2.0, 5.0, 7.0, 7.1)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:46:41 PM] ## Step 1: Analyze the Start Set
The start set is a rectangle with coordinates (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0). This means that the path can start anywhere within this rectangle.

## Step 2: Analyze the Goal Set
The goal set is a rectangle with coordinates (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0). This means that the path must end anywhere within this rectangle.

## Step 3: Analyze the Obstacles
There are seven obstacles in the environment, each represented as a rectangle with coordinates (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax). We need to check if there is a clear path from the start set to the goal set without crossing any obstacles.

## Step 4: Check for Clear Path
By examining the coordinates of the obstacles, we can see that Obstacle 1 (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (2.0, 4.0, 0.0, 1.0) blocks the path from the start set to the goal set. However, we can go around this obstacle by moving upwards and then to the right.

## Step 5: Check for Alternative Paths
After going around Obstacle 1, we need to check if there are any other obstacles blocking the path. Obstacle 2 (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (-2.0, 3.0, 2.0, 4.0) does not block the path, but Obstacle 3 (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (1.0, 2.0, -2.0, 2.0) does not block the path either.

## Step 6: Check for Remaining Obstacles
Obstacle 4 (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (-2.1, -2.0, -2.0, 7.0) is above the goal set and does not block the path. Obstacle 5 (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (5.0, 5.1, -2.0, 7.0) is to the right of the goal set and does not block the path. Obstacle 6 (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (-2.0, 5.0, -2.1, -2.0) is below the start set and does not block the path. Obstacle 7 (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (-2.0, 5.0, 7.0, 7.1) is above the goal set and does not block the path.

## Step 7: Conclusion
Based on the analysis, there is a clear path from the start set to the goal set without crossing any obstacles.

The final answer is:

- Chain of Reasoning: The path can start anywhere within the start set, go around Obstacle 1, and then move upwards and to the right to reach the goal set without crossing any obstacles.
