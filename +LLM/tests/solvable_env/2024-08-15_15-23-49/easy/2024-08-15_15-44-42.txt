# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (2.0, 4.0, 0.0, 1.0)
			Obstacle 2: (-2.0, 3.0, 2.0, 4.0)
			Obstacle 3: (1.0, 2.0, -2.0, 2.0)
			Obstacle 4: (-2.1, -2.0, -2.0, 7.0)
			Obstacle 5: (5.0, 5.1, -2.0, 7.0)
			Obstacle 6: (-2.0, 5.0, -2.1, -2.0)
			Obstacle 7: (-2.0, 5.0, 7.0, 7.1)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:44:49 PM] **Chain of Reasoning**

The start set (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0) and goal set (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0) are located in separate regions of the environment. The goal set is located to the right and above the start set. Upon analyzing the obstacles, I observe that:

- Obstacle 1 (2.0, 4.0, 0.0, 1.0) creates a horizontal barrier that partially blocks the path between the start set and the goal set. However, its y-coordinate range is limited to (0.0, 1.0), leaving enough vertical space to maneuver above it.
- Obstacle 2 (-2.0, 3.0, 2.0, 4.0) creates a vertical barrier, but its x-coordinate range (-2.0, 3.0) is to the left of the start set and doesn't affect the direct path to the goal set.
- Obstacle 3 (1.0, 2.0, -2.0, 2.0) has a y-coordinate range that spans above and below the start set. However, its x-coordinate range is too narrow to completely block the path between the start set and the goal set.
- Obstacle 4 (-2.1, -2.0, -2.0, 7.0), Obstacle 5 (5.0, 5.1, -2.0, 7.0), Obstacle 6 (-2.0, 5.0, -2.1, -2.0), and Obstacle 7 (-2.0, 5.0, 7.0, 7.1) form a perimeter that does not intersect the start set and the goal set, creating a larger region for potential paths.

By spatial reasoning, I infer that it is possible to navigate above Obstacle 1, exploiting the available vertical space to avoid obstacles and create a continuous path from the start set to the goal set. A suitable path might pass above Obstacle 1 and possibly involve small lateral deviations to clear Obstacles 3, resulting in a solution.

**Solvable**: True
