# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (2.0, 4.0, 0.0, 1.0)
			Obstacle 2: (-2.0, 3.0, 2.0, 4.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:32:41 PM] ## Chain of Reasoning
To determine if the given environment is solvable, we need to analyze the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is located at (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0), the goal set is located at (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0), and there are two obstacles: one at (2.0, 4.0, 0.0, 1.0) and the other at (-2.0, 3.0, 2.0, 4.0).

First, we observe that the start set and the goal set are not directly connected by a straight line without intersecting any obstacles. However, we need to consider if there is a path that can be constructed by navigating around the obstacles.

The first obstacle is located below the goal set and does not block the path to the goal set if we move upwards from the start set. However, the second obstacle is located to the left of the goal set and partially blocks the path. 

Upon closer inspection, we can see that there is a gap between the two obstacles. Specifically, the first obstacle ends at x=4.0, and the second obstacle starts at x=-2.0 but only goes up to y=4.0. This leaves a gap between y=1.0 and y=4.0 that is not blocked by any obstacles.

## Solvable: True

Given this gap, we can construct a path that starts in the start set, moves upwards to y=1.0, then moves to the right to x=4.0, and finally moves upwards to the goal set. This path avoids both obstacles and satisfies the requirements of the problem. Therefore, the environment is solvable.
