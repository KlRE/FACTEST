# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (-4.0, -3.0, 6.0, 7.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (5.0, 6.0, 6.0, 7.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-4.0, -2.0, 1.0, 3.0)
			Obstacle 2: (-2.0, 0.0, -1.0, 1.0)
			Obstacle 3: (0.0, 2.0, -3.0, 4.0)
			Obstacle 4: (2.0, 4.0, -1.0, 1.0)
			Obstacle 5: (4.0, 6.0, 1.0, 3.0)
			Obstacle 6: (-4.0, -2.0, 8.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 7: (-2.0, 0.0, 6.0, 8.0)
			Obstacle 8: (0.0, 2.0, 4.0, 11.0)
			Obstacle 9: (2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0)
			Obstacle 10: (4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 11: (-5.0, -4.0, 3.0, 8.0)
			Obstacle 12: (6.0, 7.0, 3.0, 8.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:43:31 PM] ## Chain of Reasoning
Upon analyzing the environment, it is clear that the start set and the goal set are positioned on the same horizontal level (ymin and ymax values are the same for both sets). However, there are obstacles that create a barrier between the start and goal sets. Obstacles 7, 8, and 9 are positioned in a way that they do not directly block the path between the start and goal sets on the same horizontal level. 

However, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that Obstacle 11 and Obstacle 12 are positioned on the left and right sides of the environment, respectively, and they extend vertically to cover the entire horizontal level where the start and goal sets are located. These obstacles, combined with Obstacles 6 and 10, which are positioned above the start and goal sets, create a barrier that prevents a direct path from the start set to the goal set without crossing obstacles.

## Solvable
False
