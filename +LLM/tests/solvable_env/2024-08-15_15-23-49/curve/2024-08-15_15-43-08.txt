# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (-4.0, -3.0, 6.0, 7.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (5.0, 6.0, 6.0, 7.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-4.0, -2.0, 1.0, 3.0)
			Obstacle 2: (-2.0, 0.0, -1.0, 1.0)
			Obstacle 3: (0.0, 2.0, -3.0, 4.0)
			Obstacle 4: (2.0, 4.0, -1.0, 1.0)
			Obstacle 5: (4.0, 6.0, 1.0, 3.0)
			Obstacle 6: (-4.0, -2.0, 8.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 7: (-2.0, 0.0, 6.0, 8.0)
			Obstacle 8: (0.0, 2.0, 4.0, 11.0)
			Obstacle 9: (2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0)
			Obstacle 10: (4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 11: (-5.0, -4.0, 3.0, 8.0)
			Obstacle 12: (6.0, 7.0, 3.0, 8.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:43:14 PM] ## Chain of Reasoning
The start set is located at (-4.0, -3.0, 6.0, 7.0) and the goal set is located at (5.0, 6.0, 6.0, 7.0). Observing the obstacles, we can see that obstacles 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 form a wall-like structure that separates the start set from the goal set. However, there is a gap between obstacles 7 and 8, and between obstacles 9 and 10. 

## Spatial Reasoning
Analyzing the environment, we can see that the gap between obstacles 7 and 8 is too small to allow a path to pass through, as the start set is located above obstacle 7 and the goal set is located below obstacle 8. However, the gap between obstacles 9 and 10 is large enough to allow a path to pass through.

## Solvable
Considering the gap between obstacles 9 and 10, we can see that it is possible to construct a path that starts in the start set, passes through the gap, and ends in the goal set, while avoiding all obstacles. Therefore, the environment is solvable.

- Chain of Reasoning: The environment is solvable because there is a gap between obstacles 9 and 10 that allows a path to pass through, connecting the start set to the goal set while avoiding all obstacles.
- Solvable: True
