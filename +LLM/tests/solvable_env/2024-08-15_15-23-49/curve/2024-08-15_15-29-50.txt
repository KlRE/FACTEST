# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (-4.0, -3.0, 6.0, 7.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (5.0, 6.0, 6.0, 7.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-4.0, -2.0, 1.0, 3.0)
			Obstacle 2: (-2.0, 0.0, -1.0, 1.0)
			Obstacle 3: (0.0, 2.0, -3.0, -1.0)
			Obstacle 4: (2.0, 4.0, -1.0, 1.0)
			Obstacle 5: (4.0, 6.0, 1.0, 3.0)
			Obstacle 6: (-4.0, -2.0, 8.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 7: (-2.0, 0.0, 6.0, 8.0)
			Obstacle 8: (0.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0)
			Obstacle 9: (2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0)
			Obstacle 10: (4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:29:55 PM] Chain of Reasoning: Analyzing the provided data, the first observation is that both the start set and goal set have their lower bounds constrained along the same vertical band, given the lower bound (6.0, 7.0) that does not interfere directly with most of the provided obstacles (bar those influencing Y and giving up minimal barrier opportunities.

These presented possible intersections permit solutional arcs.

[08/15/2024 03:30:00 PM] **Chain of Reasoning**

Upon analyzing the environment, I observe that the start set and the goal set are located on the same horizontal level, with the y-coordinates ranging from 6.0 to 7.0. However, there is a significant gap between the start set (x = -4.0 to -3.0) and the goal set (x = 5.0 to 6.0).

Obstacles 6-10 are located above the start and goal sets, and Obstacles 1-5 are located below them. Notably, Obstacles 6-10 have a larger vertical span than the obstacles below, effectively creating a "ceiling" that blocks any potential paths between the start and goal sets that attempt to go above the obstacles.

Furthermore, examining the horizontal extent of the obstacles, I notice that Obstacles 1-5 collectively block the entire horizontal span between the start and goal sets. Specifically, Obstacles 1 and 5 have x- coordinates that are closest to the start and goal sets, respectively, and their x-ranges overlap with the start and goal sets, respectively. This implies that any path attempting to traverse the horizontal distance between the start and goal sets would inevitably intersect with one of these obstacles.

Given these observations, I conclude that there is no feasible path that can start within the start set, end within the goal set, and avoid all obstacles.
