# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 2: (10.0, 10.1, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 3: (0.0, 10.0, -0.1, 0.0)
			Obstacle 4: (0.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.1)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:26:43 PM] ## Chain of Reasoning
The given environment consists of a start position, a goal position, and four obstacles. By analyzing the positions of these elements, we can observe that the start set (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0) is positioned on the left side of the environment, while the goal set (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5) is positioned on the right side. The obstacles are positioned along the borders of the environment: two along the left and right sides (Obstacle 1 and 2), and two along the top and bottom (Obstacle 3 and 4).

## Spatial Reasoning
We can notice that there is a pathway in between the obstacles on the top and bottom that could potentially connect the start set to the goal set. However, we must consider the width of this pathway and whether it is sufficient to allow a path to be constructed without crossing any obstacles.

## Pathway Analysis
The pathway between Obstacle 3 (ymin = -0.1, ymax = 0.0) and the start set (ymin = 1.5, ymax = 2.0) is clear of obstacles. Similarly, the pathway between Obstacle 4 (ymin = 10.0, ymax = 10.1) and the goal set (ymin = 8.5, ymax = 9.5) is also clear of obstacles. Furthermore, the horizontal distance between the start set and the goal set is not blocked by any obstacles.

## Conclusion
Given the clear pathways between the start set, goal set, and the absence of obstacles in between, we can conclude that there exists a path that can start within the start set, end within the goal set, and avoid all obstacles.
