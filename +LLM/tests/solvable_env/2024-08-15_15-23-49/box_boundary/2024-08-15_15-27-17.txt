# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 2: (10.0, 10.1, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 3: (0.0, 10.0, -0.1, 0.0)
			Obstacle 4: (0.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.1)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

- Chain of Reasoning:
After carefully analyzing the provided data and spatial arrangement, I concluded that there indeed exists a feasible path between the start set and the goal set while completely avoiding the defined obstacles.

Since both the start set and goal set are given as rectangular regions ((1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0) for the start and (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5) for the goal), I can select arbitrary points within these regions to initiate and terminate the path.

Moreover, looking at the obstacles provided:
- Obstacle 1 (-0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 10.0) is located outside the region where the path needs to be established because the path will begin at x = 1.5.
- Obstacle 2 (10.0, 10.1, 0.0, 10.0) can also be circumvented easily, since our destination x-range ends before this obstacle begins.
- Obstacles 3 and 4 concern only y-values at or below 0 and at or above 10.0, which do not directly impede a path that stays within the specified y-values of the start and goal sets.

Thus, a clear straight-line or simple curve path that does not intersect with obstacles is conceivable between the start and goal, considering them as a 2D space where moving freely (albeit keeping off obstacles) is possible.
