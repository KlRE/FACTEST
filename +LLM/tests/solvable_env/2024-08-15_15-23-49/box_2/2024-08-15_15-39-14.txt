# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 2: (10.0, 10.1, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 3: (0.0, 10.0, -0.1, 0.0)
			Obstacle 4: (0.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.1)
			Obstacle 5: (0.0, 10.0, 4.9, 5.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:39:21 PM] ## Step 1: Analyze the start set and goal set positions
The start set is located at (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0) and the goal set is located at (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5). This means that the start set is located in the lower left corner of the environment, while the goal set is located in the upper right corner.

## Step 2: Analyze the obstacles' positions
There are five obstacles in the environment, each represented by a rectangular set. Obstacle 1 is located at (-0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 10.0), which means it is a vertical line on the left side of the environment. Obstacle 2 is located at (10.0, 10.1, 0.0, 10.0), which means it is a vertical line on the right side of the environment. Obstacle 3 is located at (0.0, 10.0, -0.1, 0.0), which means it is a horizontal line on the bottom side of the environment. Obstacle 4 is located at (0.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.1), which means it is a horizontal line on the top side of the environment. Obstacle 5 is located at (0.0, 10.0, 4.9, 5.0), which means it is a horizontal line in the middle of the environment.

## Step 3: Determine if there is a path from the start set to the goal set without crossing obstacles
From the analysis of the obstacles' positions, we can see that there is a gap between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3, and between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 4. This means that it is possible to move from the start set to the goal set without crossing any obstacles by moving through these gaps.

## Step 4: Determine if the environment is solvable
Based on the analysis in Step 3, we can conclude that the environment is solvable because there exists a path from the start set to the goal set without crossing any obstacles.

The final answer is:

Chain of Reasoning: The start set is located in the lower left corner of the environment, while the goal set is located in the upper right corner. There are five obstacles in the environment, but there are gaps between them that allow for a path from the start set to the goal set without crossing any obstacles.
