# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (4.0, 6.0, -2.0, 0.0)
			Obstacle 2: (2.0, 4.0, 0.0, 2.0)
			Obstacle 3: (0.0, 2.0, 2.0, 4.0)
			Obstacle 4: (-0.1, 0.0, -2.0, 7.0)
			Obstacle 5: (6.0, 6.1, -2.0, 7.0)
			Obstacle 6: (0.0, 6.0, -2.1, -2.0)
			Obstacle 7: (0.0, 6.0, 7.0, 7.1)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:44:20 PM] ## Chain of Reasoning
The environment consists of a start set, a goal set, and seven obstacles. The start set is located at (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0), and the goal set is located at (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0). Obstacles 1, 2, and 3 form a barrier that separates the start set from the goal set. However, upon closer inspection, it can be seen that there is a narrow gap between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3, and another gap between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 3. These gaps are not wide enough to allow a straight path from the start set to the goal set, but they do provide a possible route if the path is allowed to be non-linear.

Obstacle 4 is located to the left of the start set and does not affect the path. Obstacle 5 is located to the right of the goal set and also does not affect the path. Obstacles 6 and 7 are located below and above the entire environment, respectively, and do not affect the path.

Given the gaps between the obstacles, it is possible to construct a non-linear path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids all obstacles. This path would need to navigate through the gaps between the obstacles, but it is theoretically possible.
