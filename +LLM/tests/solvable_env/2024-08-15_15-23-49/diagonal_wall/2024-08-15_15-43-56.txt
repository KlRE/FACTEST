# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (4.0, 6.0, -2.0, 0.0)
			Obstacle 2: (2.0, 4.0, 0.0, 2.0)
			Obstacle 3: (0.0, 2.0, 2.0, 4.0)
			Obstacle 4: (-0.1, 0.0, -2.0, 7.0)
			Obstacle 5: (6.0, 6.1, -2.0, 7.0)
			Obstacle 6: (0.0, 6.0, -2.1, -2.0)
			Obstacle 7: (0.0, 6.0, 7.0, 7.1)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:44:03 PM] ## Chain of Reasoning
Analyzing the given environment, we first observe the start and goal sets in relation to the obstacles provided. The start set is positioned at coordinates (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0), and the goal set is at (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0). 

Looking at the obstacles, we notice that Obstacle 4 and Obstacle 7 create a boundary on the left and top sides of the environment, respectively. However, these do not directly impact the path between the start and goal sets since they are positioned outside the area of interest for a direct path.

Obstacles 1, 2, and 3 are more relevant as they are positioned in a way that could potentially block a direct path from the start to the goal. However, upon closer inspection, we can see that there is a gap between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3, and also between Obstacle 1 and the boundary of the environment (considering the goal set's position).

Given the positions of these obstacles, it seems feasible to navigate around them. For instance, one could imagine a path that moves from the start set, around Obstacle 2 (either above or below it, depending on the specific start point chosen within the start set), and then continues towards the goal set, avoiding Obstacle 1 by passing above it or through the gap between Obstacle 1 and the boundary of the environment.

Obstacles 5 and 6 are positioned in a way that they do not block the path from the start to the goal, as they are either too far to the right (Obstacle 5) or too far below (Obstacle 6) to interfere with a potential path.

## Solvable
True
