# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.25, 0.75, 0.25, 0.75)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-2.0, 15.0, -2.0, 0.0)
			Obstacle 2: (-2.0, 0.0, 0.0, 15.0)
			Obstacle 3: (1.0, 4.0, 1.0, 14.0)
			Obstacle 4: (4.0, 14.0, 1.0, 4.0)
			Obstacle 5: (5.0, 14.0, 4.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 6: (4.0, 14.0, 11.0, 14.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:36:51 PM] ## Chain of Reasoning
Analyzing the given environment, we observe that the start set (0.25, 0.75, 0.25, 0.75) is positioned in a way that it is not directly blocked by any obstacles. However, the goal set (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0) is positioned in a challenging location, surrounded by obstacles on three sides (Obstacle 3, Obstacle 4, and Obstacle 5). 

To reach the goal set from the start set, a path must navigate around these obstacles. Obstacle 3 blocks the direct path to the goal set from the start set, forcing the path to go around it either from the left or the right. 

Considering the layout of the obstacles, a path could potentially go around Obstacle 3 from the right, then navigate through the gap between Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 4, and finally reach the goal set. This path would need to be carefully planned to avoid touching or crossing any obstacles.

However, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that the gap between Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 4 is actually blocked by Obstacle 5, which extends from the right side of Obstacle 3 to the left, covering the potential path to the goal set. This means that the path would have to go around Obstacle 5 as well, which seems feasible by going above Obstacle 3 and then down to the goal set.

Given the complexity of the obstacle layout and the need for precise navigation, it might seem challenging at first glance. However, considering the relative positions and the possibility of navigating around the obstacles, there appears to be a potential path that avoids all obstacles.
