# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.25, 0.75, 0.25, 0.75)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-2.0, 15.0, -2.0, 0.0)
			Obstacle 2: (-2.0, 0.0, 0.0, 15.0)
			Obstacle 3: (1.0, 4.0, 1.0, 14.0)
			Obstacle 4: (4.0, 14.0, 1.0, 4.0)
			Obstacle 5: (5.0, 14.0, 4.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 6: (4.0, 14.0, 11.0, 14.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:35:17 PM] # Chain of Reasoning
Observing the given environment, we note the relative positions and dimensions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles. A key observation is that there is a clear route from the start set to the goal set that does not inherently necessitate crossing any obstacles directly. Starting within the range (0.25, 0.75, 0.25, 0.75), a path can be theorized that moves upwards, bypassing Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2's influence due to the start's positioning above their defined spaces. From there, navigating around Obstacle 3 is possible by moving rightwards from the start before ascending, thereby avoiding Obstacle 3's space. The direct path upwards is then obstructed by Obstacle 4 and Obstacle 6, but there is a window between them through which the path can continue, considering the placement and size of Obstacle 5 allow for a navigation path above Obstacle 4 and below Obstacle 6. Given the described start and goal positions and the layout of obstacles, a path that adheres to the requirements can indeed be envisioned, keeping in mind not to cross any obstacles but rather navigate around them through the existing spatial gaps.
