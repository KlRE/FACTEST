# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.25, 0.75, 0.25, 0.75)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-2.0, 15.0, -2.0, 0.0)
			Obstacle 2: (-2.0, 0.0, 0.0, 15.0)
			Obstacle 3: (1.0, 4.0, 1.0, 14.0)
			Obstacle 4: (4.0, 14.0, 1.0, 4.0)
			Obstacle 5: (5.0, 14.0, 4.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 6: (4.0, 14.0, 11.0, 14.0)
			Obstacle 7: (13.0, 14.0, 10.0, 11.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:55:13 PM] ## Chain of Reasoning

The start position is a rectangular set located at (0.25, 0.75, 0.25, 0.75). This start position is not enclosed by any obstacles and has a clear path to the right. The goal position is located at (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0), which is to the right of the start position. Obstacles 3, 4, and 5 are positioned in a way that creates a corridor for the path to go through.

Upon closer inspection, we can see that there is a possible path from the start position to the goal position by navigating through the corridor created by the obstacles. Specifically, we can start from the right edge of the start set and move upwards to avoid obstacle 3. Then, we can move to the right and pass between obstacles 3 and 4. Next, we can move downwards to avoid obstacle 5 and then move to the right again to reach the goal set.

The path is non-crossing and avoids all obstacles by a safe margin. Therefore, it is possible to construct a path that meets the requirements.
