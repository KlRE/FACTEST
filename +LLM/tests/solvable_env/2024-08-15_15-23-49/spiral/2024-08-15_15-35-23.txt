# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.25, 0.75, 0.25, 0.75)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-2.0, 15.0, -2.0, 0.0)
			Obstacle 2: (-2.0, 0.0, 0.0, 15.0)
			Obstacle 3: (1.0, 4.0, 1.0, 14.0)
			Obstacle 4: (4.0, 14.0, 1.0, 4.0)
			Obstacle 5: (5.0, 14.0, 4.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 6: (4.0, 14.0, 11.0, 14.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:35:29 PM] ## Chain of Reasoning
Analyzing the environment, we can observe that the start set is positioned at (0.25, 0.75, 0.25, 0.75) and the goal set is at (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0). There are several obstacles that restrict the movement between the start and goal sets.

First, Obstacle 1 (-2.0, 15.0, -2.0, 0.0) and Obstacle 2 (-2.0, 0.0, 0.0, 15.0) do not directly block the path between the start and goal sets. However, Obstacle 3 (1.0, 4.0, 1.0, 14.0) and Obstacle 4 (4.0, 14.0, 1.0, 4.0) create a significant barrier between the start and goal sets. 

A potential path could be to move from the start set, avoiding Obstacle 3, and then move around Obstacle 4 to reach the goal set. However, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 4 are positioned in such a way that they effectively create a "corridor" that blocks direct access to the goal set from the start set.

Obstacle 5 (5.0, 14.0, 4.0, 10.0) and Obstacle 6 (4.0, 14.0, 11.0, 14.0) do not further restrict the path between the start and goal sets.

Considering the positions and dimensions of the obstacles, it is possible to find a path that starts within the start set, ends within the goal set, and avoids all obstacles. A feasible path could involve navigating around the obstacles, using the available space to create a route that connects the start and goal sets.
