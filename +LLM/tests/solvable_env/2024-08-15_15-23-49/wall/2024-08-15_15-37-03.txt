# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.0, 9.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (4.0, 5.0, -3.0, 4.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:37:08 PM] **Chain of Reasoning**

To determine if the environment is solvable, I will analyze the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles. The start set is located at (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0) and the goal set is located at (8.0, 9.0, 0.0, 1.0). Obstacle 1 is positioned at (4.0, 5.0, -3.0, 4.0), which creates a vertical barrier between the start and goal sets.

However, the key observation is that Obstacle 1's y-coordinate range (-3.0 to 4.0) is partially below and partially above the start and goal sets' y-coordinate range (0.0 to 1.0). This creates a small window or "corridor" above the obstacle where a path can potentially pass through without crossing the obstacle.

Additionally, there is enough clearance on either side of the obstacle for a path to bypass it by going around it, rather than directly crossing it.

Given this analysis, it is clear that a path can be constructed that starts in the start set, avoids the obstacle, and reaches the goal set. The specific shape of the path can be chosen such that it exploits the gap above the obstacle and curves around it without touching.

**Solvable**: True
