# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.0, 9.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (4.0, 5.0, -3.0, 4.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:37:51 PM] ## Chain of Reasoning
To determine if the environment is solvable, we need to analyze the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.

First, let's observe that the start set (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0) and the goal set (8.0, 9.0, 0.0, 1.0) are both rectangles with a width of 1 unit and a height of 1 unit. They are also positioned on the same horizontal plane (y-axis), which indicates that any path connecting them must traverse a horizontal distance of at least 7 units (since the minimum x-coordinate of the goal set is 8.0, and the maximum x-coordinate of the start set is 1.0).

Next, let's examine the obstacle (4.0, 5.0, -3.0, 4.0). We notice that this obstacle is positioned on the same horizontal plane as the start and goal sets and has a width of 1 unit. Crucially, the obstacle's x-coordinate range (4.0-5.0) intersects with the required horizontal traversal distance between the start and goal sets.

However, upon closer inspection, we realize that the obstacle's vertical extent (-3.0 to 4.0) does not completely block the horizontal path between the start and goal sets. Specifically, there is a gap above the obstacle (y > 4.0) and below the obstacle (y < -3.0) that a path could potentially use to bypass the obstacle.

Given this observation, we can deduce that it is possible to construct a path that starts within the start set, ends within the goal set, and avoids the obstacle by navigating through the gap above or below the obstacle.
