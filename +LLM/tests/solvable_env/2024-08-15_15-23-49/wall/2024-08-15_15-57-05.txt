# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.0, 9.0, 0.0, 1.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 2: (2.0, 2.1, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 3: (0.0, 2.0, -0.1, 0.0)
			Obstacle 4: (0.0, 2.0, 10.0, 10.1)
			Obstacle 5: (4.0, 5.0, -3.0, 4.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

## Chain of Reasoning

To analyze the given environment, let's start by examining the spatial relationships between the start set, goal set, and obstacles. We have five obstacles, four of which create a sort of 'alleyway' in the environment. This 'alleyway' can potentially provide a route between the start set and the goal set.

## Alleyway

Upon closer inspection, it seems like Obstacle 2 creates a sort of 'gate' in the environment, leaving enough space to move through. Moreover, this gate can be combined with Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 5 to provide an 'alleyway' through which the path can move without touching the obstacles.

However, a crucial factor in determining solvability is whether there is any space at the start of this alleyway. 

## Access to the Alleyway

A significant insight comes from looking at Obstacle 3 and Obstacle 4, which provide clear boundaries in the negative and positive y-direction, respectively. By creating an unobstructed access route between these boundaries and through the gate in Obstacle 2, a valid path seems feasible.

This specific sequence of movement possibilities leaves sufficient room for path planning and it doesn't matter what arbitrary waypoints you pick in this area, they could provide enough information for finding the solvable solution.


## Path from Start Set to Goal Set

Lastly, one only has to cross a completely unobstructed straight path (because you chose valid start and goal positions and by finding one segment for which this line will work as your new connection for movement.) then with certainty state this 'connection path works'.
For certain all arbitrary waypoint values give unobstructed movement-connection lines between your chosen valid 'start' and 'goal' points (because 'connecting waypoints linearly' will not provide obstruction).  Only these chosen points need follow only one thing about arbitrary chosen start/goal: both inside of these respective chosen respective set.


## Conclusion

Based on the given analysis, there seems to be a valid path from the start set to the goal set without touching obstacles. This makes the environment solvable.

- Chain of Reasoning: Analyzing spatial relationships between start set, goal set, and obstacles revealed a feasible path through an 'alleyway' created by obstacles. We found that the path does not have to end exactly on a boundary of the goal set; any point within the set is valid.
