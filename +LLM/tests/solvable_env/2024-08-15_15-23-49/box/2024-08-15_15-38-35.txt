# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (-0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 2: (10.0, 10.1, 0.0, 10.0)
			Obstacle 3: (0.0, 10.0, -0.1, 0.0)
			Obstacle 4: (0.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.1)
			Obstacle 5: (4.9, 5.0, 0.0, 10.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

## Chain of Reasoning
Analyzing the given environment, the first step is to understand the spatial layout and the positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles. 

- The start position is a rectangular set defined by (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0), which is entirely within the bounds of the enclosing area defined by obstacles 1, 2, 3, and 4. However, it's crucial to note that there are no obstacles directly surrounding the start set that would prevent the path from extending outward.
  
- The goal position is another rectangular set, defined by (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5), which is similarly positioned within the bounds of the same enclosing area but on the opposite side from the start set.

- The obstacles provided include four obstacles that create the outer boundary (obstacles 1, 2, 3, 4) and one obstacle (obstacle 5) that acts as an inner divider at (4.9, 5.0, 0.0, 10.0). This divider does not completely block the path between the start and goal sets but requires any path to go around it.

Given this setup, a path that starts within the start set can avoid obstacles and reach the goal set by navigating around obstacle 5. The path could start at any point within the start set (for example, the center point 1.75, 1.75), then move horizontally towards the right until it reaches a point beyond obstacle 5, and then navigate vertically upwards to enter the goal set. This path satisfies all conditions: it starts within the start set, ends within the goal set, and avoids all obstacles.
