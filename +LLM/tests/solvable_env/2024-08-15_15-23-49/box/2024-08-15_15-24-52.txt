# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (3.0, 7.0, 3.0, 7.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:24:58 PM] ## Step 1: Identify the positions and dimensions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.
The start set is a rectangle with (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 2.0), the goal set is a rectangle with (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (8.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9.5), and the obstacle is a rectangle with (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (3.0, 7.0, 3.0, 7.0).

## Step 2: Analyze the spatial relationships between the start set, goal set, and obstacles.
The start set is located at the bottom left corner of the environment, the goal set is located at the top right corner of the environment, and the obstacle is located in the middle of the environment.

## Step 3: Determine if the start set and goal set overlap with the obstacle.
The start set does not overlap with the obstacle because its xmax (2.0) is less than the obstacle's xmin (3.0). However, the goal set does not overlap with the obstacle because its xmin (8.5) is greater than the obstacle's xmax (7.0).

## Step 4: Analyze potential paths from the start set to the goal set while avoiding the obstacle.
There is a clear path from the start set to the goal set that does not intersect with the obstacle by going around the obstacle from the top or bottom.

## Step 5: Determine if the environment is solvable based on the analysis.
Given that there is a clear path from the start set to the goal set while avoiding the obstacle, the environment is solvable.

The final answer is:

- Chain of Reasoning: The start set and goal set do not overlap with the obstacle, and there is a clear path from the start set to the goal set that does not intersect with the obstacle by going around it from the top or bottom.
- Solvable: True
