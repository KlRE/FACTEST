# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.4, 0.6, 3.4, 3.6)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (6.25, 6.75, 4.5, 5.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (1.0, 3.0, 0.9, 1.0)
			Obstacle 2: (1.0, 5.0, 3.9, 4.0)
			Obstacle 3: (0.9, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0)
			Obstacle 4: (1.0, 2.0, 2.9, 3.0)
			Obstacle 5: (1.9, 2.0, 2.0, 3.0)
			Obstacle 6: (2.0, 4.0, 1.9, 2.0)
			Obstacle 7: (3.9, 4.0, 1.0, 3.0)
			Obstacle 8: (2.9, 3.0, 3.0, 4.0)
			Obstacle 9: (4.0, 6.0, 0.9, 1.0)
			Obstacle 10: (4.9, 5.0, 2.0, 4.0)
			Obstacle 11: (5.0, 6.0, 1.9, 2.0)
			Obstacle 12: (5.9, 6.0, 2.0, 5.0)
			Obstacle 13: (4.9, 5.0, 0.0, 1.0)
			Obstacle 14: (0.0, 7.0, 0.0, 0.1)
			Obstacle 15: (0.0, 0.1, 0.0, 3.0)
			Obstacle 16: (0.0, 0.1, 4.0, 5.0)
			Obstacle 17: (0.0, 6.0, 4.9, 5.0)
			Obstacle 18: (6.9, 7.0, 0.0, 5.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:34:09 PM] ## Chain of Reasoning
The given environment consists of a start set, a goal set, and multiple obstacles. To determine if the environment is solvable, we need to analyze the spatial relationships between these elements.

Upon examining the coordinates of the start set (0.4, 0.6, 3.4, 3.6), we notice that it is located in a relatively open area with some obstacles nearby, but not directly adjacent. The goal set (6.25, 6.75, 4.5, 5.0) is positioned far from the start set and has several obstacles in between.

Obstacles 14 and 15 block the left and bottom sides of the start set, respectively, but there appears to be a gap between Obstacle 15 and Obstacle 1 that could potentially be used as a path. However, upon closer inspection, we can see that Obstacles 3, 4, and 5 create a barrier that blocks this path.

Another possible route would be to move around Obstacle 1 and through the gap between Obstacles 1 and 6. However, this path is also blocked by Obstacles 7 and 10.

Furthermore, Obstacles 2 and 16 create a narrow corridor that seems to connect the start set to the goal set, but Obstacle 8 blocks this path.

After analyzing the spatial relationships between the start set, goal set, and obstacles, it appears that there is no clear path that avoids obstacles and connects the start set to the goal set.
