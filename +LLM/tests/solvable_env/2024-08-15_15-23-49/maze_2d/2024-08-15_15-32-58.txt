# Motion Planning Solvable Task
## Task: Determine if the given Environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles.

## Path Requirements
    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints and the path will be constructed by connecting these waypoints linearly. Use arbitrary waypoints that do not always have to be parallel to one axis.
    Non-Crossing: Ensure the path and especially the linearly connected segments do not cross any obstacles. Make sure to keep a distance from the obstacles, because touching the obstacles is considered as crossing.
    Start and End: The path must start within the start set and end in the goal set.
    
## Provided Data
    Start Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (0.4, 0.6, 3.4, 3.6)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to start the path.
    Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = (6.25, 6.75, 4.5, 5.0)
        Note: You can choose any point within this rectangle to end the path.
    Obstacles (Rectangular Sets): (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax):
			Obstacle 1: (1.0, 3.0, 0.9, 1.0)
			Obstacle 2: (1.0, 5.0, 3.9, 4.0)
			Obstacle 3: (0.9, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0)
			Obstacle 4: (1.0, 2.0, 2.9, 3.0)
			Obstacle 5: (1.9, 2.0, 2.0, 3.0)
			Obstacle 6: (2.0, 4.0, 1.9, 2.0)
			Obstacle 7: (3.9, 4.0, 1.0, 3.0)
			Obstacle 8: (2.9, 3.0, 3.0, 4.0)
			Obstacle 9: (4.0, 6.0, 0.9, 1.0)
			Obstacle 10: (4.9, 5.0, 2.0, 4.0)
			Obstacle 11: (5.0, 6.0, 1.9, 2.0)
			Obstacle 12: (5.9, 6.0, 2.0, 5.0)
			Obstacle 13: (4.9, 5.0, 0.0, 1.0)
			Obstacle 14: (0.0, 7.0, 0.0, 0.1)
			Obstacle 15: (0.0, 0.1, 0.0, 3.0)
			Obstacle 16: (0.0, 0.1, 4.0, 5.0)
			Obstacle 17: (0.0, 6.0, 4.9, 5.0)
			Obstacle 18: (6.9, 7.0, 0.0, 5.0)

    
## Instructions
Solvable: Determine if the given environment is solvable or not. It is solvable if there exists a path that starts in the start set, ends in the goal set, and avoids obstacles. An answer is sufficient without a explicit path.
Chain of Reasoning: Provide a chain of reasoning that supports your answer. This can include any observations, insights, or logical deductions that you made while analyzing the environment.
Spatial Reasoning: Use spatial reasoning to analyze the environment. This includes understanding the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles.    
No code: Do not include any code in your response and do not try solve this with an algorithm.

## Output Format
- Chain of Reasoning: A textual description of the chain of reasoning that supports your answer.
- Solvable: A boolean value indicating whether the environment is solvable or not.

## Example
- Chain of Reasoning: The start set is completely enclosed by obstacles, so there is no way to reach the goal set without crossing obstacles.
- Solvable: False

[08/15/2024 03:33:05 PM] **Chain of Reasoning:**

To determine if the environment is solvable, we need to analyze the relative positions of the start set, goal set, and obstacles. Upon inspection, we notice that the start set is located in the top-left region of the environment, while the goal set is in the bottom-right region.

Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2 create a barrier that separates the start set from the rest of the environment. However, there is a narrow gap between Obstacle 2 and Obstacle 3, which provides a potential path for reaching the goal set.

By examining the obstacles in the middle region, we can see that there is a narrow corridor formed by the gaps between Obstacle 4, Obstacle 5, Obstacle 6, and Obstacle 7. This corridor allows for a possible path from the start set to the goal set.

Obstacle 9 and Obstacle 10 create another barrier, but there is a gap between Obstacle 10 and Obstacle 11, which provides a potential connection to the goal set.

In the bottom-right region, we notice that the goal set is not completely enclosed by obstacles, which means it is possible to reach the goal set from the narrow corridor mentioned earlier.

**Solvable:** True

**Rationale:** Based on the analysis, we can conclude that the environment is solvable because there exists a potential path from the start set to the goal set that avoids obstacles. The narrow corridors and gaps between obstacles provide a feasible route for reaching the goal set.
