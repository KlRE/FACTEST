Motion Planning Task: 2D Maze Navigation

In this task, we aim to navigate from a defined start position to a goal position within a 2D space, avoiding a series of rectangular obstacles. The environment is given with specific coordinates for the start position, goal position, and obstacles.
Problem Definition

    Start Position: Defined by the boundaries (0.4, 0.6, 3.4, 3.6).
    Goal Position: Defined by the boundaries (6.25, 6.75, 4.5, 5.0).

Maze Environment

Here are the obstacle details:

python

obstacles = [
    (1.0, 3.0, 0.9, 1.0), (1.0, 5.0, 3.9, 4.0), (0.9, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0), (1.0, 2.0, 2.9, 3.0),

    (0.0, 7.0, 5.0, 5.1)
]

Task Instructions

    Plot the Course: Visualize the start position, obstacles, and goal position on a 2D plot.

Plotting the Course

To plot the environment:

    Draw each obstacle as a rectangle.
    Highlight the start and goal positions distinctly.

Here’s the Python code to achieve this:

python

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.patches as patches

def plot_environment(obstacles, start, goal):
    # Create a new figure
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 10))
    plt.xlim(0, 7)
    plt.ylim(0, 5)
    
    # Plot each obstacle
    for (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) in obstacles:
        rect = patches.Rectangle((xmin, ymin), xmax - xmin, ymax - ymin, linewidth=1, edgecolor='r', facecolor='r', alpha=0.5)
        ax.add_patch(rect)
    
    # Plot the start position
    (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = start
    start_rect = patches.Rectangle((xmin, ymin), xmax - xmin, ymax - ymin, linewidth=1, edgecolor='g', facecolor='g', alpha=0.5)
    ax.add_patch(start_rect)
    
    # Plot the goal position
    (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) = goal
    goal_rect = patches.Rectangle((xmin, ymin), xmax - xmin, ymax - ymin, linewidth=1, edgecolor='b', facecolor='b', alpha=0.5)
    ax.add_patch(goal_rect)
    
    # Add labels and legend
    plt.xlabel("X")
    plt.ylabel("Y")
    plt.title("2D Maze Navigation")
    plt.legend(['Obstacles', 'Start Position', 'Goal Position'], loc='upper right')
    
    # Show the plot
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()

# Define start and goal positions
start = (0.4, 0.6, 3.4, 3.6)
goal = (6.25, 6.75, 4.5, 5.0)

# Plot the environment
plot_environment(obstacles, start, goal)

Explanation

    Obstacles are displayed as red rectangles.
    Start Position is highlighted in green.
    Goal Position is highlighted in blue.

Path Planning

For the next step, we would implement a pathfinding algorithm like A* or Dijkstra’s to find a feasible path from the start to the goal while avoiding obstacles. This involves:

    Graph Representation: Represent the environment as a graph where nodes are positions and edges are valid movements.
    Algorithm Execution: Apply the chosen algorithm to find the shortest path.

If you need further assistance with the pathfinding algorithm or any other details, please let me know!
Motion Planning Task: Path Generation
Task Objective

    Avoid Obstacles: The path must not intersect any obstacles.

Path Requirements

    Waypoints: The path should be represented as an array of waypoints.
    Linear Connection: Each pair of consecutive waypoints should be linearly connected.

python

path = [
    (start_x1, start_y1),    # Chosen point from the start set
    (waypoint_x2, waypoint_y2),
    (waypoint_x3, waypoint_y3),
    ...,
    (goal_xn, goal_yn)       # Chosen point from the goal set
]

Note: Only output the array of waypoints representing the path. Do not include any code or algorithm details.

Your task is to generate this path while meeting all the criteria.
