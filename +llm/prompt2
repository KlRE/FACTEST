Motion Planning Task: maze_2d

Today, we will solve a 2D motion planning problem. The goal is to navigate from a start position to a goal position, avoiding rectangular obstacles.
Problem Definition

    Start Position: Rectangles specified by their boundaries.
    Obstacles: Rectangles specified by their boundaries.
    Goal Position: Rectangles specified by their boundaries.


Maze Environment
The following data are rectangles in the form (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax).

Start Position (Rectangular Set): (0.3, 0.7, 3.3, 3.7)
Goal Position (Rectangular Set): (6.25, 6.75, 4.5, 5.0)
Obstacles:
obstacles = [
    (1.0, 3.0, 0.9, 1.0),   # Obstacle 1
    (1.0, 5.0, 3.9, 4.0),   # Obstacle 2
