Motion Planning Task: maze_2d

Today, we will solve a 2D motion planning problem. The goal is to navigate from a start position to a goal position, avoiding rectangular obstacles.
Problem Definition

    Start Position: Defined by boundaries.
    Obstacles: Rectangles specified by their boundaries.
    Goal Position: Defined by boundaries.

IMPORTANT: All Rectangles are encoded as (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax).
Maze Environment

Obstacles:
obstacles = [

Start Position:
start = (0.4, 0.6, 3.4, 3.6)

Goal Position:
goal = (6.25, 6.75, 4.5, 5.0)

Instructions

    Plot the Course: Visualize the start position, obstacles, and goal position as rectangles and plot them as rectangles.
